# Artificial Intelligence (AI) Comprehensive Outline

## Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
- Definition of AI
  - "Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems."
- Historical Background
  - The Dartmouth Conference of 1956: The birth of AI as a field.
  - Key milestones in AI development.

## Types of Artificial Intelligence
- Narrow AI (Weak AI)
  - Designed to perform a narrow task (e.g., facial recognition, internet searches).
  - Examples: Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant.
- General AI (Strong AI)
  - Theoretical AI that possesses the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can.
  - Current status and challenges in achieving General AI.
- Superintelligent AI
  - AI that surpasses human intelligence.
  - Ethical considerations and potential risks.

## Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- Definition and Differences
  - Machine Learning: "A subset of AI that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to perform tasks without explicit instructions."
