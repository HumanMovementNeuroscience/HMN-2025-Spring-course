- full_transcript: we&amp;#39;re recording now um so to repeat that um the the proper
    assignment like the the proper proper like poster proposal assignment will be
    on uh like a one or two sentence right up on the topic area that you&amp;#39;re
    going to want your poster to be on and a singular citation of a paper that kind
    of represents what that research what what what that like research in the area
    that you&amp;#39;re going to be presenting on um um the standard assignment for
    22.99 is that you&amp;#39;re supposed to pick a singular paper for the whole semester
    and then your poster is going to be you presenting just that paper um I think
    we can go a little bit beyond that if that&amp;#39;s all you want to do that&amp;#39;s
    totally valid um but I think we can do a little bit more broad of a of an overview
    um and uh but to keep us kind of honest we&amp;#39;re just I&amp;#39;m going to
    ask you to to pick a singular paper and then the the bot me mediated conversation
    will be sort of designed to help you do that so if you you know give it say here&amp;#39;s
    the topic I want to study um here&amp;#39;s a paper I&amp;#39;m thinking about
    here&amp;#39;s the abstract um I&amp;#39;ll prompt I&amp;#39;ll make the bot prompted
    to kind of like ask you the kind of questions um that you know I would ask you
    if I have the time and energy to kind of sit down and talk about it um behind
    the curtain when they talk about this class uh the most of what they tell us to
    do is try to help you guys not pick a review article for your paper and to pick
    an actual proper like Empirical research article like because it&amp;#39;s really
    it&amp;#39;s like like if you just go search for papers on a given topic you&amp;#39;re
    going to find review articles at the top of that list and it&amp;#39;s not always
    super obvious whether you&amp;#39;re looking at a review article or a book chaper
    or like an empirical study um so I can tell the bot to help you with that uh and
    it&amp;#39;ll do things like asking you about the methodologies and topics and
    stuff like that so just kind of like helping you kind of like parse the very very
    dense language that an abstract or scientific papers typically written in um and
    so then there will be some like sort of like simple check boxy style of canvas
    assignment and then like a Discord server based conversation space there um and
    those will be ostensibly um do um next week so end of next week meaning 11:59
    p.m. on Sunday before the following Monday and if you don&amp;#39;t hit that deadline
    there will be dire consequences um not really but it&amp;#39;s sort of we wanted
    to keep kind of in that General Cadence that the that we&amp;#39;re all kind of
    like on the same path um and probably probably by the end of this next week is
    when the I will have implemented the stuff where the bot will be kind of like
    keeping track of a profile of your interests and trying to like help in the journey
    that you will take through this General field um but we&amp;#39;ll see anytime
    I make a promise about the future just know internally I am screaming um great
    okay off up okay who cares um yes okay let&amp;#39;s go ahead and get into it
    um I know what to do methods I realized I forgot um Mo cap tracking Etc okay I
    also forgot a piece of equipment that I intended to bring today uh so I will use
    this instead someone doesn&amp;#39;t know how to great that works all righty okay
    so let us begin the lecture proper um so it&amp;#39;s been nice for the first
    part of this class kind of seeing you guys talking about your interest in the
    server you know kind of talking to the bot about what you&amp;#39;re into and
    what you want to study and things like that um and I I intentionally wanted to
    have that part happen first before I kind of talk about my own talk too much about
    my own particular sort of map of this space um because I I didn&amp;#39;t want
    to uh I wanted to let you guys kind of like think about it for yourselves before
    I came up and did like the like the traditional Professor thing which is to tell
    you here&amp;#39;s what this field is and here&amp;#39;s what this means and here&amp;#39;s
    what the here&amp;#39;s what is on topic here&amp;#39;s what is off topic um because
    I generally don&amp;#39;t think that that&amp;#39;s how we should think about
    intellectual inquiry um and the next chunk of time I&amp;#39;m going to give you
    an overview of this domain of human centered Neuroscience um that is mostly related
    to my own particular history my own research background my own the studies that
    I&amp;#39;ve done um and anytime that you you know by the time that you have sort
    of lived long enough to have Specialties and personal experiences and whatnot
    you will have sort of charted your own path and trajectory Into the Heart of some
    field or some domain um and for pretty much all of you you know for everyone that
    sort of chooses to follow a route kind of like that um you are going to have a
    sort of unique path like everybody&amp;#39;s path is going to be different and
    everybody&amp;#39;s sort of the the the topics that are relevant to everybody&amp;#39;s
    interest will all will be will be different um so I don&amp;#39;t want to present
    this stuff in the sense that in a sense of saying here is everything that matters
    here is everything that is relevant to this topic um I I really want to keep it
    kind of on that like relatively personalized Narrative of these are the topics
    that are the most important for me to be able to study human human perceptual
    motor Neuroscience in the ways that I specifically have learned how to do um and
    sort of talking about that in that Con in that context of like the the the component
    pieces of my particular specialty um and I think the beauty of using sort of AI
    mediated Tools in a classroom setting is that in a traditional class the professor
    kind of like lays out the curriculum lays out the structure lays out the topic
    area and then you are all kind of constrained to follow that structure um and
    that&amp;#39;s largely for practical reasons like it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s
    just too hard and it requires too much human labor to like really mediate and
    like sort of navigate the particular um sort of variations of interest of people
    in a room even even a room that is labeled under a particular course title um
    but I think with the AI you know limited though it may be it will always do a
    do its damnedest to sort of make whatever your interests are relevant to the topics
    that I have mandated it should care about um so as I start going through this
    stuff uh just encouraging you to really learn to key in to like your own personal
    feelings of interest in your own personal feelings of like being drawn or snagged
    or moved by some topic or some domain um and you know if you want to follow the
    trajectories that I&amp;#39;m doing that&amp;#39;s all well and good but even
    if you wanted to you wouldn&amp;#39;t it wouldn&amp;#39;t happen that way because
    that&amp;#39;s not how the world Works um and so as I give this sort of lecture
    um my main request for you is to just not let your brain turn all the way off
    I&amp;#39;m going to be talking fast about a lot of sort of topics that are going
    to be relatively unfamiliar um for some of them they might be the first time you&amp;#39;ve
    heard about it for some of them you might have heard about it before uh the goal
    is not to have you understand everything that I&amp;#39;m saying the goal is to
    just expose you to it um so as I start sort of blah blah bling at you um don&amp;#39;t
    get too hung up on whether or not you&amp;#39;re following everything just kind
    of like remember the words as much as you can try to let just try to let it wash
    over you I promise you nonzero of it will be attaching um and then when we kind
    of open things back up uh you can start asking the bot asking your neighbors the
    questions about the parts that were the most interesting to you and the part that
    I have found the most gratifying about doing this type of a class is the Discovery
    every time empirically that when I give a lecture on a given topic and then I
    say to 40 students ask the bot about the parts you found most interesting typically
    what I see from that is 40 different conversations about 40 different topics and
    that&amp;#39;s really a lot of fun um so with that said let us get get into it
    um unfortunately I I brought I intended to bring a um like a tablet so I could
    like draw like stuff with colors um and I brought the tablet but then when I looked
    for like the the pen part I found I just thrown like this like standard pencil
    into here which I can&amp;#39;t even I can&amp;#39;t even imagine what was going
    on when I did that so we&amp;#39;re just doing we&amp;#39;re going to do it old
    school with unfortunately just a singular color but that&amp;#39;s okay um let&amp;#39;s
    see move over here so was your fault how dare you okay I&amp;#39;ll just I&amp;#39;ll
    put it on your bill um um um okay so right so the topic of the course is neuroscience
    the the department is biology and most of you as biology majors and whatnot have
    internalized to some degree or another with validity that biology and Neuroscience
    are things are is is Rel is related to things like cells and neurons and wet lab
    microscope types of conversations and stuff like that super valid super good topics
    good things to look at um and all kind of part and parcel with a particular philosophical
    tradition that is so fundamental to the way that we do scientific research in
    2025 in Earth um that we often don&amp;#39;t even think about it and that is the
    concept of reductionism that&amp;#39;s not your way um so reductionism is just
    sort of a general philosophical approach to the study of the natural world um
    which tries to break things down into smaller and smaller pieces so that with
    you can sort of make more and more precise measurements and more more precise
    topics more more precise investigations but this kind of like sort of like implicit
    assumption that at some point there will be that by looking at the component pieces
    of the world you&amp;#39;ll be able to get a sense of the istic view of how everything
    works um and there&amp;#39;s a lot of validity to that approach but there&amp;#39;s
    also obviously a lot of limitations to that um because if you&amp;#39;re only
    looking at the small pieces in isolation you never going to see or you&amp;#39;re
    going to have a hard time seeing what we call emergent properties which are things
    that only really come about when you look at the the combination of things at
    a larger scale than the kind of things you can put into a test tube and under
    a microscope um the classic example of emergence is traffic um so traffic is a
    property of cars on a road um but you can never understand traffic by looking
    at a singular car it&amp;#39;s something that only really comes about when you&amp;#39;re
    looking at the cars operating in their natural environment um and so you know
    the the counter to reductionism is what you might call more holism or something
    like that um but that tends to be the scale that my sort of research domain tends
    to operate in is I I tend not to be like I look at the research of the people
    who are doing the highly reduced sort of like electrophysiology studies where
    they put electrodes into the brains of various animals um fmri where they have
    people in a tube and they&amp;#39;re looking at the magnetic resonance of their
    hemoglobin in their brain um but my particular domain of research tends to focus
    on humans behaving in natural environments doing um the kinds of stuff that we
    do in our sort of day-to-day lives so you know like throwing things in the air
    and catching them involves there&amp;#39;s a motor behavior of putting Force into
    the marker an information gathering phase and then another motor command which
    if it lines up with the world works out if it doesn&amp;#39;t I drop it um and
    large sort of trying to understand that behavioral process um in its natural context
    and then trying to use whatever the best measurements that I can come up with
    um of those behaviors and then trying to attach them to sort of the more low-level
    reductionist sort of um fields of inquiry so that we can have a sense of like
    you know how the things like cells and neurons can lead to complex behaviors like
    that so I think of it as kind of like it&amp;#39;s almost like a robotics approach
    so it&amp;#39;s I like to tell people that I studi the part of Neuroscience that
    overlaps with robotics um because robotics is another field that kind of like
    keeps you honest in the sense that it&amp;#39;s you make things that move around
    in the real world so you can&amp;#39;t really cut that many corners so the thing
    just stops working um and the difference is that the like robots we know how they
    work because we made them but we they can&amp;#39;t do all the things we want
    humans we don&amp;#39;t really know how they work but they can do pretty much
    anything so there&amp;#39;s this kind of combination of those two sort of thinking
    about the human as like a magical meat robot and trying to study it and understand
    it from the that perspective um can lead to a lot of useful results um and the
    nice thing about that is kind of the abstraction away from the biology and from
    the the the knowledge that it is in fact under the hood cells and neurons and
    you know membrane potentials and things like that um and thinking about it more
    in the terms of the things that we can measure um which we will talk about shortly
    um so let&amp;#39;s talk so speaking of the natural world let&amp;#39;s sort of
    talk about something which you know is one of the ways to parse out that General
    topic which is what&amp;#39;s called the perception Action Cycle um so let&amp;#39;s
    start by drawing a brain I&amp;#39;m trying to draw it I&amp;#39;m draw yes let&amp;#39;s
    do it like that um so here&amp;#39;s how you draw a brain there you go um the
    sorry try and you&amp;#39;ll figure it out okay so this is your brain this is
    a picture of your brain that&amp;#39;s your temporal lobe this is your eye you&amp;#39;re
    facing that way um and there&amp;#39;s a lot of details that are not being covered
    here but this is the general shape so here you are that&amp;#39;s your that&amp;#39;s
    that&amp;#39;s you and you existence in the world and let&amp;#39;s see let&amp;#39;s
    do this different way there you go that&amp;#39;s you you&amp;#39;re in the world
    and here here&amp;#39;s your body here&amp;#39;s your eye here&amp;#39;s your
    mouth and then inside of there that&amp;#39;s your brain not to scale and so as
    you are in the world you have a very limited awareness of of your given context
    and the everything that that you know comes in through your senses and well your
    senses in your memory so let&amp;#39;s think about a particular moment in time
    where you&amp;#39;re sitting here you have your eye and then you see out here
    there&amp;#39;s a cat you like cats and so you so the image so light from the
    sun bounces off the cat and goes into your eye and we&amp;#39;ll talk a lot about
    eyes we&amp;#39;ll talk about the lens we&amp;#39;ll talk about the retina we&amp;#39;ll
    talk about the phobia we&amp;#39;ll talk about the optic nerve um but the most
    the main thing is that their your eye is the place where environmental energy
    is first absorbed by your nervous system and this moment right here is a very
    special moment in your perceptual cycle which is the moment of transduction um
    which is the term for the moment when some form of environmental energy in this
    case light has gets transduced and converted into neural activity in this particular
    case in your this is your eye the light goes in it goes into your retina into
    your phobia which talk plenty about um there&amp;#39;s a particular uh class of
    molecule called opsin opsins look roughly like this this like you know um what
    are they called carbons and hydrogens and then the hexagon and then the long the
    long uh sort of Wiggly tail um the people in Biochemistry this is probably familiar
    shapes except this is not drawn well and then you have a bunch of these opsins
    in your eye um and they&amp;#39;re all there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s basically
    three main ones and they&amp;#39;re sort of they&amp;#39;re all they they&amp;#39;re
    tuned if you want to use that term to different wavelengths of light and they
    the nature of them is that when a photon of light hits them they absorb the energy
    of that Photon and then change shape and I think I actually did this backwards
    I think they start out with the Kink and then when they absorb the light they
    straighten out um but whatever happens this absorption of a photon changes the
    electrochemical properties of the molecule and it goes from being a neutral to
    a plus one or a minus one or whatever it is um but the point is that the the the
    light that is coming from the environment bouncing off the cat entering your eye
    changing the chemical layout of the opson um and happening in the trillions and
    billions of sort of instances that biology tends to operate in um this changes
    the polarity and the Electrical uh state of the rods and the cones in your retina
    which get sort of you know accumulated with ganglia and various sort of other
    stuff um and leads to a shift in the uh electrical potential in the in that section
    of your retina that then gets sent in as spikes down your optic nerves neurons
    are the things that Neuroscience is made of and mostly what neurons do is they
    Spike they send little electrical pulses and that&amp;#39;s how they communicate
    that whatever that neuron has tuned to has has occurred um and for a for a for
    perception for vision it&amp;#39;s this absorption of light into the opson and
    the and the shift in this polarity and then the change in that electrical state
    that leads to a change in the um what&amp;#39;s the term uh the spike rate of
    of a given gangan cell as it is sending its axon down the optic nerve into your
    um optic the occipital lobe and the the visual cortex um and so we&amp;#39;re
    going to talk more about this in more detail and more coherence um but the important
    thing here is that the light that has been absorbed by your eye that is then gets
    converted through this strange biochemical machine into a pattern of neural activity
    uh because the neural activity is caused by the light and because the light has
    been reflected off the object in question there is a general belief and assumption
    um that that the pattern of neural activity has somehow has some relationship
    with the object in the real world there&amp;#39;s some statistical correlation
    there&amp;#39;s some relationship and the pattern of neural activity somehow encodes
    information about the world that you&amp;#39;re looking at um the nature of that
    relationship is tenuous and complex um and generally speaking extremely impoverished
    like the actual information we&amp;#39;re getting in any mo One Moment In Time
    is far less than you think it would be it&amp;#39;s a lot but the richness of
    your visual environment for example is very much an illusion based off of your
    brain&amp;#39;s ability to sort of Cobble together a lot of noisy information
    to give you something that&amp;#39;s sort of accurate enough to move through the
    world but often in almost exclusively designed sort of like after the fact um
    so that&amp;#39;s your brain again um it&amp;#39;s more like a ma brain but that&amp;#39;s
    fine so your optic so the light comes into your eye gets absorbed by the retina
    which is on the back of your eye sends a pattern of neural activity down your
    optic nerve um passes through some subcortical areas and the thalamus and stuff
    like that which we&amp;#39;ll talk not that much about that part but there is
    some stuff that happens here um and then projects down to the occipital lobe which
    is otherwise known as the visual cortex which is in the back of your brain um
    not super important to know where it is but it&amp;#39;s just just kind of like
    one of those things like it&amp;#39;s like Vision happens here for in the back
    for whatever reason um and so this is the place where the first kind of like the
    first pass of information about your visual environment sort of starts to get
    computed and it&amp;#39;s mostly in the form of like edges and dark patches light
    patches you know and stuff like that and once you get from V1 which is primary
    visual cortex it goes through other stages of processing that lead to sort of
    more and more complex you know um structures to emerge so like you start with
    things like edges and then if you have enough edges you can get patches and if
    you get patches then you can get textures and if you get textures you can get
    objects and that sort of like each stage of visual processing Builds on the stage
    before um to sort of eventually lead to the ability to do things like object recognition
    of like oh that thing out there is a cat there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a conversation
    we can have about like like the the parts of that process that go down this lobe
    which is your temporal lobe which is here um tends to be the sort of object space
    of like that&amp;#39;s a desk that&amp;#39;s a computer um and then the part that
    we tend to care more about in this class is the part that goes up this direction
    um which tends to be more in tune of using that information to plan your movement
    out in the world um something that I haven&amp;#39;t said I think yet but probably
    but is something that bear is repeating is obviously this is a cartoon this is
    a very abstracted simplified version of a story which if you wanted to tell the
    whole story you would have to tell a thousand thousand stories of a thousand thousand
    humans in their Labs recording data getting a bunch of numbers and then making
    up their own stories and the discussion sections of their own papers about what
    the different parts mean and then this kind of cartoonified story is the version
    that tends to make it into the textbooks that we T sort of communicate back to
    you and sort of try to make sense out of any of it but I think it&amp;#39;s really
    important that we remember that this is not the real story this is the cartoon
    and the real story is something that we don&amp;#39;t actually have access to
    there is no there&amp;#39;s no level like of of class where I can just give you
    the book that says here is what the visual cortex is actually doing the best I
    could ever do is just to give you a record of all the empirical measurements that
    all the humans who have ever investigated this man to put together and then tell
    you the story that we have collectively decided is the best story that we can
    come up with for how we think this part of this lumpy pink thing inside of all
    of our skulls is operating um but yeah but that&amp;#39;s not there is a gap an
    essential gap between epistemology which is our knowledge of things and metaphysics
    which is what actually exists uh and the two things never truly touch there is
    always going to be a difference between knowing something and what that thing
    actually is and in the history of science we have told many many many stories
    about what we think is going on in the world and in our bodies and in our goopy
    bits um and historically over time every single one of those stories on a long
    enough time scale is proven wrong in some sense everything we currently think
    think will eventually be proven wrong in some way or another um evidence for that
    being everything we&amp;#39;ve ever thought up until this point has been proven
    wrong in some way or another um so as you think there&amp;#39;s something special
    about today that&amp;#39;s going to keep happening um indefinitely until the sun
    burns out but the beauty of the scientific process in some sense is that we have
    this belief that even though everything has been wrong there is a sense that each
    success of idea is less wrong than the one before it and less wrong means that
    it allows us to make more precise predictions it allows us to heal sickness better
    it allows us to build machines that do more exciting things um sometimes those
    improvements happen by completely throwing around throwing out philosophical sort
    of like base level beliefs about how certain things work um but yeah it&amp;#39;s
    a continuous process we&amp;#39;ll talk about it um yes so so here we are in this
    cycle you the light has bounced off the cat it&amp;#39;s hit your eye it&amp;#39;s
    been absorbed it&amp;#39;s been transmitted back to your visual cortex um you
    have identified that it&amp;#39;s a cat and you have a an inbuilt volition that
    says I like to touch cats great we support this for you so this is the parietal
    lobe don&amp;#39;t worry about the parietal lobe it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s great
    but you can worry about it if you want um but the important sort of okay so this
    back here is your visual cortex um this on the side here roughly speaking is your
    motor cortex and So eventually you start as you as you look in more and more pictures
    of the brain you will and you can look at this directly the the the wrinkles and
    stuff on the brain are not random they are conserved in the same sense that while
    every face that we have looks very different they generally have two eyes and
    a nose and a mouth and just in different kind of configurations the wrinkly stuff
    and the the crevices and bumps and stuff on her brain roughly the same like if
    you were to crack open all the brains in this room which I don&amp;#39;t recommend
    um you would find a lot of Correspondence in where the the big um creases and
    stuff come in um and I am not at the level of that anatomy where I can name them
    off the top of my head um but I do recognize them in pictures and that&amp;#39;s
    how you can kind of it&amp;#39;s easy to tell when someone is drawing a brain
    artistically versus when they&amp;#39;re looking at Anatomy because artists and
    whatnot often just say oh yeah it&amp;#39;s a bunch of like pink wrinkles and
    then you just sort of it&amp;#39;s like okay well that&amp;#39;s not that&amp;#39;s
    not actually how we do but anyways there&amp;#39;s a big one right in the mirror
    called the central sulcus sulcus is like the crease part and on this side of that
    sulcus is the somato sensory cortex somat sensation is like basically touch like
    think that this type of sensation um and on that side is the motor cortex so the
    n sensory cortex and then the motor cortex and they tend to be paired and you
    can look up I&amp;#39;ll you we&amp;#39;ll look up the huny LI when we talk about
    the motor cortex um but I kind of it&amp;#39;s It&amp;#39;s I enjoy this distinction
    and kind of like there&amp;#39;s these two sides of the brain where on this side
    of the brain it&amp;#39;s kind of like sensation and sort of the the perception
    of the world like visual aspects and this the sort of sensory aspects and then
    on this side of the brain is where we start getting to like motor actions and
    movements and kind of the outgoing parts of things um and as we sort of keep going
    forward you eventually get over here to the frontal loes um the frontal lobe is
    like the big lumpy part in the front that&amp;#39;s the like the the the most
    human part of the brain all Maman brains are roughly the sort of same anatomically
    they&amp;#39;re just very fun mirrored into different sort of shapes and sizes
    like you know rats have a much more pronounced Factory bulb for smell versus their
    visual cortex and the human brain has a has a lot of extra Anatomy on that frontal
    lobe area this is thought to be kind of where decision making comes from this
    is where sort of like language kind of lives and often in it&amp;#39;s um referenced
    in uh like executive function so that the feeling of like deciding what you want
    to do this is also where like metacognition happens so if you&amp;#39;re having
    thoughts about your thoughts like oh yeah I&amp;#39;m angry right now like that&amp;#39;s
    a that&amp;#39;s a frontal loby area and and just reiterating the point every
    time I point to a part of the brain and I say this is the part that does this
    thing a little part of me inside is screaming and dying because none of this is
    how any of it that like that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the cartoon that&amp;#39;s
    not how the real world is set up it&amp;#39;s much more complex than that it&amp;#39;s
    much noisier than that but it&amp;#39;s if I say this is where executive function
    happens and I point at the front of the brain and then this is where Vision happens
    and I point at the back of the brain that statement is more true than if I switch
    those two things around so just it&amp;#39;s important to reiterate that even
    though I am telling you these simplified stories these sort of textbook level
    conversations about how the brain is this is the stuff that if we come back to
    this class in 250 years we&amp;#39;re going to be saying very very different things
    but we&amp;#39;ll probably still say something like the vision happens in the
    back and the cognition happens in the front anyways um from this frontal lobe
    from the you get sort of the frontal area executive functions then you get your
    premotor area and somewhere around here is where volitions arise volition is sort
    of same route as voluntary it&amp;#39;s like the things that you want to do so
    you see you see the the cat and you say I want to touch the cat here is the cat
    and look at me I&amp;#39;m touching it and that&amp;#39;s this is what I want
    to happen and so now you are in this state where here&amp;#39;s your body here
    here&amp;#39;s your hand there here&amp;#39;s this cat there and here&amp;#39;s
    this desire that I sure wish that my hand part was on this cat part um and this
    sort of and now there&amp;#39;s a a gap between the way that the world is in your
    perception and the way the world that wish the way that you wish the world would
    be which is that your hand was sort of touching this object okay so those volitions
    kind of meld with uh the perceptual experience and from this sort of alchemy emerges
    something resembling a motor plan um we&amp;#39;re going to I&amp;#39;m trying
    to stop myself from going to some of these details because I am going to have
    like like we&amp;#39;re going to have a whole lecture about the eye we&amp;#39;re
    going to have a whole lecture about the motor cortex we&amp;#39;re going to talk
    about this in more detail I&amp;#39;m just giving the overview uh but um but yeah
    but this is where we would call something the first time we start seeing something
    resembling a motor plan there&amp;#39;s a lot of times in the chats y&amp;#39;all
    have been having where you talk about things like muscle memory um which is the
    sort of muscle memory is kind of like the uh it&amp;#39;s a term we like to use
    it&amp;#39;s like a very standard human expression um but it&amp;#39;s also one
    of the things that like it doesn&amp;#39;t really exist in a physiological sense
    like your Mo your muscles don&amp;#39;t have memory they&amp;#39;re much simpler
    object which we will talk about muscles too um usually what you mean when you
    say muscle memory is motor plan um and as you sort of work on something more and
    more and you get more expertise more experience that&amp;#39;s the that that what
    we tend to refer to as motor as muscle memory is really like the motor plans kind
    of becoming more robust and more sort of locked in um and typically where a lot
    of that kind of motor planning takes place is not necessarily in the motor cortex
    um but most of that starts happening in subcortical regions um so if you think
    about a picture of the brain and you think about the that pink wrinkly thing in
    your skull that&amp;#39;s T tends to be what we think about that&amp;#39;s your
    cortex that&amp;#39;s the um neocortex it&amp;#39;s the part where most of the
    processing happens um which we&amp;#39;ll talk a little about what processing
    means in this context um but it is I like to I like to talk about this as like
    that is the it&amp;#39;s like that&amp;#39;s kind of like the the bloom of the
    rose on the rose bush like when you think about the nervous system and you&amp;#39;re
    looking at when you&amp;#39;re looking at a rose bush it makes a lot of sense
    that we tend to focus on the rose like the red thing with petals and that smells
    nice and we spend a lot of our time focusing on that part of the plant in for
    very good reason but if you really take a step back and look at it from a b botney
    point of view it&amp;#39;s mostly Bush and just a little bit of row and I think
    that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of the same with the way our cortex works um
    the majority of our central nervous system is not in that cortex it&amp;#39;s
    in the subcortical regions and among my favorite of those subcortical regions
    is the cerebellum which it look sort of sits at this looks kind of like this fist
    shaped thing that sits right below your cortex when you look up pictures of the
    brain online you&amp;#39;ll see the big pink wrinkly thing you see this kind of
    more dense sort of like grayish looking thing underneath it um that&amp;#39;s
    your cerebellum your cerebellum is a very complicated Beast um it contains about
    3.5 times as many neurons as the rest of your central nervous system combined
    um and that number is sort of strangely conserved across different animals like
    all animals mammals particular just because I don&amp;#39;t know about the other
    guys um we all have cortex we all have cerebellum we have very different brain
    to body ratios and different sort of proportions there but in General however
    big your brain is whatever animal you are your cerebellum is has three and a half
    times as many neurons as the rest of your cortex um which is one of those things
    like I I always sort of come back to that it&amp;#39;s sort of like that just
    seems anytime you find a number in nature that&amp;#39;s conserved across a bunch
    of different stases it&amp;#39;s just kind of like that seems like an interesting
    thing I wish I knew more about it um so your cerebellum the part of the reason
    why has so many more like neurons by by count is that the neurons in associated
    with it are teensy teensy tiny they are you have granual cells and you have pingi
    cells um which I W I&amp;#39;m going to look up pictures this because ah uh Peri
    cells oh do I have internet here yeah yeah preni cells in your cerebellum are
    like one of the more beautiful parts of the nervous of your of your brain it&amp;#39;s
    kind of you have the cell body you have the axon and then these are all the synapses
    and all of there&amp;#39;s thousands upon thousands of them um this picture is
    famous this was actually taken by not picture but it&amp;#39;s um this is from
    pinji the guy who sort of like he he created was it oh sorry kahal uh says right
    there um Ramon kahal who yeah um was part of the sort of group that came up with
    the staining mechanisms that allowed us to sort of start looking at neurons in
    their isolation that happened in roughly 1909 before that we didn&amp;#39;t really
    know what neurons were and didn&amp;#39;t know if they were just one big mass
    or if they were individualized pieces and there was like a big scientific and
    philosophical debate about are neur is is the brain all one big connected piece
    or did the like do the do the neurons touch or are they separated from each other
    and there was Ramon Cal who was arguing in the favor of the synapse Doctrine which
    said that there was a gap between them and then there I think it was GOI who was
    arguing in favor of their it&amp;#39;s all touching whatever that was called and
    then um GOI came up with like a silver nitrate staining process that allowed them
    to make images like this of looking at cells and ironically by making that staining
    process prove the Cal side of that argument correct and that they tend not to
    touch and then they both got both Ramon Cal and GOI got they shared a Nobel Prize
    but apparently they had such bad blood between them that they both spent their
    entire speech bashing the other guy um so there you go there you got that um but
    yeah so your so your cerebellum is consists of preni cells and then granu cells
    which in comparison look more like this they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re small
    and they don&amp;#39;t have these super long fibers that sort of go very long
    distances they&amp;#39;re much more localized they only connect to their immediate
    neighbors um and the majority of ner of of neurons in your nervous system are
    these granular cells that live in your cerebellum your cerebellum is a layered
    thing um like most parts of your brain it&amp;#39;s got kind of like um like the
    layers tend to operate phog gentically so that on the outside is the newest stuff
    on the inside is the older stuff um sellum has that structure we may talk about
    it I&amp;#39;m not sure uh we&amp;#39;ll see it&amp;#39;s one of those things
    like if enough people talk to the bot and ask about this then I might like I&amp;#39;ll
    be I&amp;#39;ll be trying to steer the lectures based off the interest of the
    class um but anyway we&amp;#39;re talking about cats um so light hit the cat hit
    your eye absorbed in your retina tweaked your opsins triggered a neural Cascade
    vibrated your visual cortex uh gave you the perception of a cat your volitional
    desire to touch the cat combined with the knowledge that there&amp;#39;s a cat
    in front of you and started creating a motor plan which sort of you know this
    is where the cartoon gets really cartoony because it&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s
    a lot of controversy about like the different steps of this process but long story
    short something in the com combination of your motor cortex and your cerebellum
    which is your cerebellum is largely like a motor based thing like a movement it
    mostly deals with movement of your body um it&amp;#39;s thought to be related
    to like tool use um so this this thing that we humans can do where we pick up
    an object and kind of pretty quickly learn the physics of it um and using it as
    a tool that has certain sort of characteristics is thought to be like a neoc thing
    the Neo is the new part it&amp;#39;s on the outside it&amp;#39;s complicated um
    but there&amp;#39;s a level there&amp;#39;s a hierarchical nature of your motor
    system where at the at the higher levels where the top is pretty much like the
    frontal lobe the the the plans are much more abstract so it&amp;#39;s things like
    I&amp;#39;m thirsty um I want I wish I was drinking water right now uh and then
    in order for that high level volition to be turned into something that can actually
    sort of lead me to my goal there has to be this sort of like um pairing down of
    specificity from that very high level volition uh down to something which at some
    level is going to have to boil down to muscle fir rings to move my body through
    space and so as I say oh I wish I had water I see that there&amp;#39;s water over
    there and somehow that volition is converted into motor commands that move my
    legs so now my body is in a place that I can move my arm I know how this thing
    works so I open the thing and I get to drink water um and so that process tends
    to go you know from the motor cortex then you got the cerebellum then your cerebellum
    sort of has connections to your brain stem I say connections but they&amp;#39;re
    really kind of like they&amp;#39;re wrapped around each other um so you have your
    brain stem your medulla oblongata your ponds um that&amp;#39;s the part of your
    brain people talk about your Reptilian Brain that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that
    part that&amp;#39;s the part that handles things like is my heart beating am I
    breathing is my temperature within a livable range that tends to be hanging out
    and controlled at your brain stem um and your brain stem is the start of your
    spinal cord which is another good friend there we go there you go there you perfect
    nice still you good job um and so your spinal cord is a part of your central nervous
    system often times when we think about the spinal cord it&amp;#39;s often kind
    of it&amp;#39;s It&amp;#39;s given a bad W and we tend even when we look at pictures
    of like if you Google pictures of the central nervous system you&amp;#39;ll often
    see pictures that stop here and it&amp;#39;s just sort of like you know cortico
    centrism sort of just focused on that that rose on the bush and then less to say
    about you the cerebellum often gets in the picture but we often like cut off where
    the spine is um but your spine is just as much a part of your nervous system as
    the rest of it and the specifically the way that we&amp;#39;re going to Define
    central nervous system as opposed to peripheral nervous system is uh Loosely that
    the central nervous system is where processing happens um where processing is
    a very goopy term um that basically means like information is coming in being
    some sort of conversion is happening which we might call a computation if we wanted
    to use like a computer analogy um but it information comes in changes form in
    some way and then information goes out um and the and you&amp;#39;re and the the
    spine is doing that kind of of processing um at various levels which we will also
    talk about let me see how we are on time okay on time um but it&amp;#39;s in very
    find it kind of fascinating ways and there are some stories that we will talk
    about later in the semester of studies that we aren&amp;#39;t allowed to do anymore
    um on cats where you can sever the spine like like cut the spine so it no longer
    connects to the upper part of the brain um and the cat can still do things like
    walk um because the spine is is housing the the gray matter that that does that
    handles things like Central pattern generation and reflex responses um or something
    like a central pattern generator is a thing that handles like the basic rhythmic
    motion of my legs and the thing that says oh well one foot is going to be in stance
    and the other one&amp;#39;s going to be in swing and then they&amp;#39;re going
    to sort of swap off um and a lot of that processing is handled in the spine itself
    um your spine goes down your spinal cord ends actually around here like right
    below your thoracic spine I know right um and then the stuff below that is what&amp;#39;s
    called like the cotus aquinus which is like that&amp;#39;s where it does become
    more um extension Cordy like and you you start to lose the gray matter and you
    get the more just like the peripheral nerves that go out to your limbs um yeah
    the yeah so the peripheral so I also just want to just again make that point that
    that distinction between central nervous system and peripheral nervous system
    is the kind of thing that is often stated as like this is a hard delineation um
    but there&amp;#39;s a lot of gray area there one of the most classic gray areas
    is the retina um the retina has a lot of neurons on the back of it and there&amp;#39;s
    layers to it and it&amp;#39;s often described like we think about the retina like
    the eye sort of like the classical sensory organ um but there&amp;#39;s stuff
    happening on the back of the retina before anything even leaves on on that optic
    nerve pass to the brain that really could be considered to be computation um similarly
    your skin has a lot of connections in it that you know might be doing things that
    we might consider computation um that&amp;#39;s why like when you get hurt if
    you like rub rub the thing it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt as much because the ACT the
    activity of activating sensory organs around the damaged area suppresses the feeling
    coming from the damaged area and that is all happening at the level of your skin
    um so just again this this these these names and terms and whatnot this is not
    like nature is not design divided into pieces with departments and names that&amp;#39;s
    a thing that we humans did to Nature so that we could have any hope of making
    any sense of it but anytime we put a name or a label or or a category into nature
    we&amp;#39;re always going to be making concessions and sort of we&amp;#39;re
    drawing lines around areas because it allows us to have better conversations about
    those things but there&amp;#39;s always going to be gray areas and often times
    it&amp;#39;s those gray areas or the cracks that the that tend to lead us to abandon
    certain thoughts and go towards others um okay so speaking of the peripheral nervous
    system um so where I wish had colors uh there you go okay this is your arm that&amp;#39;s
    these are your bones and your bones are mostly what you are like if we&amp;#39;re
    thinking about it in terms of like the space that you inhabit like the shape that
    you are your general sort of ability to move through the world it&amp;#39;s mostly
    bones um and then all the goop that&amp;#39;s associated with that is sort of
    the details but the General cookie cutter shape of you as a as a creature is driven
    by these weird sticks and these weird sticks have weird things attached to them
    called muscles um and yeah and So eventually one of the things that happens when
    you thinking about the sort of like more holistic picture of the world and sort
    of the way that you live in it um is be if you&amp;#39;re in a lab if you&amp;#39;re
    if you&amp;#39;re living this reductionist life where you&amp;#39;re choosing
    a particular domain of inquiry um and you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re sort of simplifying
    and cutting out any extraneous factors that get in your way to to sort of zoom
    in as far as you can on that particular thing um you get to remove all the parts
    of the question that you don&amp;#39;t want to look at and so if you&amp;#39;re
    a neuroscientist you might have you might take the mouse or the rat or the fruit
    fly or whoever you want to look at into the lab and then just like remove all
    the parts that you that aren&amp;#39;t Neuroscience so that you can have a better
    picture of the neurons that you care about when you want to think about when you
    don&amp;#39;t have that capacity and you want to think about things more generally
    um you don&amp;#39;t have that um that luxury and so if you want to think about
    how humans move through the world um and even if you care mostly about the neural
    aspects of it even if you care mostly about the perceptual aspects of that you
    are sort of required by the nature of reality to consider things like bones and
    muscles even though those are not particularly neural objects um because when
    we move when when our all this weird neural FL flam is eventually going to have
    to transmit down into something that moves the body through the world and this
    is where we get to the kind of the robotics y conversation because um this is
    the part where the neural activity which has been originally transduced into this
    sensory experience of of vision um all of that sort of combination of things is
    eventually going to get boiled down here to something that sort of flips that
    coin around and now the neural activity is going to be converted into environmental
    energy in this case in the form of mechanical energy so it&amp;#39;s going to
    squeeze my muscle and my arm is going to move that muscle my arm is going to be
    move and this is now has there&amp;#39;s an there&amp;#39;s literal like energy
    in this movement specifically in the form of kinetic energy or you know you know
    if I&amp;#39;m pulling on a spring or something like that might be mechanical
    energy like potential energy kinetic energy spring energy that&amp;#39;s the stuff
    that we get from our muscles and so there&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the whole perception
    action cycle is this conversion of environmental energy into perceptual neural
    activity down back into a motor action and so your muscles are weird objects um
    and a muscle is effectively a variable stiffness spring that&amp;#39;s pretty
    much what a muscle is muscles only pull your muscle can only pull on things muscles
    cannot push if when I when it looks like I&amp;#39;m pushing it&amp;#39;s because
    this muscle is pulling on the tip of that bone so that my arm goes that way and
    that that&amp;#39;s called extension and then if I want to squeeze this one then
    I send a motor command down there it fires the motor tendon Union GGI body organs
    and it says Hey surrounding muscle tissue contract and so this what was originally
    a fairly Wiggly Soft Spring gets electrified and becomes a rather stiff spring
    and pulls this joint up and this one there&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re paired there&amp;#39;s
    a flexion uh muscle group and then there&amp;#39;s the extension muscle group
    and those two things operate in conjunction to to move this degree of freedom
    and that type of so yeah and so that so the motor plan that comes down from the
    motor cortex and sort of through the cerebellum if you&amp;#39;re a fancy type
    of an animal like a human it goes through the corticos spinal tract which goes
    there is a sort of connection straight from your motor cortex down to your spine
    bypassing things like your cerebellum all animals have a cortical spinal tract
    but it&amp;#39;s really um but not to equal degree um and that&amp;#39;s one of
    the interesting distinctions in the animal kingdom is like this is a fun this
    is one of my favorite I actually use this question to test like AI models to see
    how it does at Neuroscience is asking about the cortical spinal tract and how
    it varies across the animal kingdom because that&amp;#39;s one of the places where
    the questions get really subtle um and so I can look at how it does at that answer
    to see like I&amp;#39;m looking at like a local model I can run on my computer
    like the small ones I I can watch it get the subtle Parts wrong when I ask it
    that kind of a question so but a lot of stuff I&amp;#39;ve been talking about
    about how like motor cortex motor commands go through like the cerebellum and
    the brain stem and stuff like that that is true um but there is also this cortico
    spinal tract anytime you see one of those big words with an o in the middle just
    replace the o with a slash so cortico spinal is C cortex SL spinal that just basically
    go straight from the cortex down to the spine bypassing all the subcortical regions
    um and it&amp;#39;s what allows us to be to control our individual degrees of
    freedom of our body directly um as opposed to doing things in like it&amp;#39;s
    more synergistic way which is way deeper than I want to talk about in this particular
    lecture cheing that clock it&amp;#39;s killing me um so yeah so here I am I&amp;#39;m
    so close I&amp;#39;m so ready to almost touch this cat um and I my motor my motor
    plan which has come down from on high down this sort of hierarchical structure
    of our motor system has uh taken my awareness of the world and my own body so
    the vision gives me information about remote parts of the world things I can not
    touch things that are outside of mine here&amp;#39;s a great word peripersonal
    space the per personal space is the area that I can touch with my hands um outside
    of that is a different part of the world that&amp;#39;s kind of happening in the
    parietal Lo one of my favorite studies is this like they got a monkey Myck monkey
    and they trained it to grab things on a desk um and then they gave gave it a a
    temporary lesion so they just like squirt something into the part of the brain
    that handles that peripersonal perception so that that part of the brain kind
    of goes offline um and you get what&amp;#39;s called cortical blindness so the
    monkey sort of loses its ability to to see things cartoon cartoon um in that per
    personal Zone then they took the monkeys and they train it to use a grabber arm
    like a little like like claw arm so it now its reach is now farther because it
    can use this arm and when they ask after they teach it how to use it and they
    sort of leion that per personal Zone the blind spot increases to include the region
    that could be reached with the Grabber in addition to the hand um so put that
    into your worldview and see how it fits um so anyways um here I am I see this
    cat and I have this awareness of my body a lot of this is sort of call kind of
    associate that with um proprioception um so like as my arm is out here it is uh
    putting force on my joints because of the weight of the arm and my body can encode
    and is aware of those forces and I can use that to kind of be aware of where my
    arm is I can also see my arm I also have a memory of lifting it up there&amp;#39;s
    a lot of ways that we know where our bodies are um but I know that it&amp;#39;s
    here and that if I can make this part move that way um then I&amp;#39;ll have
    I will have achieved my my my deepest desire of touching this cat um and so there&amp;#39;s
    there&amp;#39;s a lot of comp complicated stuff about the like we don&amp;#39;t
    move our body one joint at a time we move it in the sort of like barely sophisticated
    dance um and a lot of that the breakdown and how we sort of how we choose to to
    to break down a complex movement across the available joints in the context of
    the world that&amp;#39;s a a cerebellum thing again cartoons um but let&amp;#39;s
    pretend like it&amp;#39;s not and so I I relax what is it so I I relax the flexor
    I tighten the extensor and that puts a torque on this bone which moves my hand
    here and now I have the reward of cat Sensations under my hand and I have now
    achieved this this goal of mine um right and so now and now we have and that&amp;#39;s
    that&amp;#39;s the loop so that&amp;#39;s one path through that perception action
    Loop because now that the information has gone in been processed been sort of
    whatever and now that I have moved my body I have now changed the state of the
    world like my body is in the world so now as I&amp;#39;m perceiving the situation
    as it stands I&amp;#39;m perceiving something different and now I&amp;#39;m going
    to go back through that Loop and so of you know you perceive you act and then
    you take in the information and you kind of like that Loop is tends to be where
    you live your whole life um and so yeah and so this is kind of the cartoon overview
    of of the story as it as it holds um I will name some of the uh the fields associated
    with the things that we talked about um yeah uh generally speaking when we talk
    about well talking about like the physiology of the eyeball tends to be kind of
    like optology I guess um uh but that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s more like lens and
    pupil and like the the goopy Parts um once you&amp;#39;re talking about like the
    the neural the neural activity aspect of it we tend to call that like visual like
    visual Neuroscience perceptual Neuroscience because we are such Vision heavy animals
    as humans often when you hear perceptual we tend to mean visual um but strictly
    speaking it&amp;#39;s all like anything sensory is perceptual um when we start
    talking about the parts of the Neuroscience that are moving your body we tend
    to call that motor Neuroscience you will often hear people talk about perceptual
    motor Neuroscience which again perceptual motor is the same perceptual SL motor
    and it&amp;#39;s kind of like it&amp;#39;s this connection and this kind of like
    this reality that the two parts are um perception in action and perception in
    motor control they&amp;#39;re sort of intimately linked um oh I should mention
    this too um in your peripheral nervous system you have peripheral neurons and
    your peripheral neurons come in two types there is perceptual and there&amp;#39;s
    motor shockingly and that distinction is is defined by basically which direction
    the information is Flowing so a motor command goes out from your central nervous
    system towards your periphery carrying a motor command so this this is a a neuron
    that&amp;#39;s connected to a you know motor unit in my muscle and if it gets
    sort of tapped by one of these higher level structures it&amp;#39;s going to get
    spikes that are telling it to Fire and that will contract the muscle um once I
    touch the cat what was the object of my plans um there are the the the the the
    the neurons connected to like the sensory um organs in my hand start firing differently
    and they send information back down your sensory peripheral nerves peripheral
    sensory nerves yeah so in your periphery it is just it&amp;#39;s out outward stuff
    is your motor neurons um inward stuff is your Sensory neurons and that&amp;#39;s
    kind of the main distinction there um again uh just the word cartoons going on
    there yeah why are you aware what&amp;#39;s that why you not like aware why are
    you not aware yeah this is one of I think the most troubling realities of being
    alive is that and this is also part of the the standard um existential crisis
    that classes like this tends to give to people so have fun with that um we have
    a very very thin awareness of what is going on under the hood in our bodies and
    we have we have some awareness we have some conscious experience of like I&amp;#39;m
    going to reach out and grab this thing I&amp;#39;m going to oh yeah this feels
    cool in my hand this feels hard in my hand um but the more you learn about neuroscience
    and the more you learn about what&amp;#39;s going on in the Hood the more you
    realize that those sensory that like the cognitive like the the conscious personal
    experience of having a motor experience um is a really really thin layer on top
    of a lot of complexity that&amp;#39;s going on and that is unfortunately just
    like the situation that we are in um remember one time I was in grad school and
    we were in like a a parking lot my friends and winter waiting to go on a hike
    or something like that and for some reason this really stuck with me but there
    was just like a puddle of like dirty water in the middle of the parking lot that
    had this like really beautiful like oil sheen on top of it and it was just like
    the sort of fractal iridescent colors just and by the nature of oil it&amp;#39;s
    just like one molecule thick that is giving this really beautiful like vibrant
    colorful shape on top of just cold dark murky water and I think about that a lot
    when I think about the nervous system because it just feels like that is kind
    of our experience of living in a body is we have this experience that is sort
    of riding on top of this really deep and complex biological neural complex system
    and the that conscious Sheen is related to the depths of what&amp;#39;s going
    on there but we don&amp;#39;t really tend to have access to it like I can&amp;#39;t
    feel my stomach deciding when it wants to squirt out more enzymes to digest my
    food and I can&amp;#39;t tell the difference between you know parts of this thing
    happening and you know like it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s not really available
    to me there are once you start learning about the about the bits and pieces you
    can start kind of mapping on your your conscious experiences to the things that
    I&amp;#39;m going to be telling you is maybe happening under the hood um one of
    the ones that&amp;#39;s coming to me right now for whatever reason is like it&amp;#39;s
    kind of a thing that is known where when when when a person starts lifting weights
    for the first time if you&amp;#39;ve never been a weightlifting person there&amp;#39;s
    a a thing that happens where you very quickly like you&amp;#39;ll shoot up the
    amount of weight that you can lift in a very short amount of time because your
    body is learning how to fire all of your motor units at once and that&amp;#39;s
    just the thing that in your general life you just tend not to do and you kind
    of have to learn how to do that like how to extend like maximal effort and that
    is something that&amp;#39;s happening at the level of like recruitment of motor
    units and so if you then if you now go to the gym and you start having that experience
    you sort of feel oh yeah I&amp;#39;m getting super strong and it&amp;#39;s just
    kind of like you can map that experience onto this thing I just said about how
    your motor units work but it&amp;#39;s in but that mapping is in the this like
    weird cognitive space like it&amp;#39;s not at that level of like deep awareness
    but then you have to ask like what what would that even look like if it was yeah
    so over time when you&amp;#39;re like lifting weight why do you hit a because
    eventually you you&amp;#39;re recruiting all of your motor units and then you
    just don&amp;#39;t have enough muscle to produce the force so that&amp;#39;s the
    that beginner spike in performance is you&amp;#39;re not actually growing muscle
    mass in that period of time you&amp;#39;re just learning how to actually like
    use all the muscles that you have and then you hit that plateau and it&amp;#39;s
    like okay well now I&amp;#39;m using I&amp;#39;m firing 100% of my muscle abilities
    just my muscles aren&amp;#39;t strong enough to actually move my body so and a
    lot of those sort of plateaus in performance can be sort of tied back to sort
    of physiological structures that change and like the time courses of of improvement
    happen that you know like growing more muscle takes time whereas learning how
    to fire motor units also takes time but not in the same way so a lot of dep there
    um that area that I was just so speaking of naming I never I&amp;#39;ve never
    been able to finish a leure before the end of class um that thing were just that
    little area is kind of often in the area we would call neuromechanics neuromechanics
    is a relatively new newly named field I would be curious to see if it&amp;#39;s
    in that mesh uh terminology thing we learned about last time um but neuromechanics
    neural mechanics um is kind of like at that boundary of neural activity and like
    and like physics like mechanics um stuff uh so that thing of like firing a motor
    unit to create a spring force that moves the limb that&amp;#39;s a neuromechanical
    question um and then like how that connects to like the spinal Central pattern
    generators you know that&amp;#39;s where it starts to get like is that still neuromechanics
    is that you know these are murky areas um on the other side of neuromechanics
    you have biomechanics biomechanics is literally Newton&amp;#39;s Laws as it applies
    to meat um and we will be talking about that uh to some level of specificity um
    the not too distant future um let&amp;#39;s see yeah let me let me finish this
    up and we&amp;#39;ll talk about that um yeah so biome mechanics is related to
    like just the physics of moving your body um we&amp;#39;re particularly going
    to talk about descriptions of the body that are that basically remove any conception
    of biology from them and just thinking about the human as an object that weighs
    a lot and is balanced on a pretty narrow uh platform and that&amp;#39;s sort of
    center of mass base of support level of uh description of the human body which
    we will talk about in some detail pretty soon um another thing I haven&amp;#39;t
    mentioned but we will talk about to is evolution because all of these systems
    are evolved systems they all they developed over billions of years um to the form
    that they currently are and in the same sense of things you can describe the system
    as it stands right now but you&amp;#39;re always going to be missing some of the
    story if you don&amp;#39;t think about it in the context of how it emerged um
    and so I haven&amp;#39;t quite figured out a lot of the things I&amp;#39;m talking
    about are the things that are going to go into these sort of numbered lectures
    once I sort of figure out how I want to chop things up um there&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m
    going to be extracting a lot of things from what your conversations are to figure
    out how to steer that those lectures um there&amp;#39;s some hit points that I&amp;#39;m
    going to hit no matter what you guys want to do um and evolution is going to be
    one of those things and specifically for us um it&amp;#39;s going to I&amp;#39;m
    going to be well I guess talk a little about the evolution of your eye but um
    I think a lot of my particular interest is in the thing that is often yeah evolution
    of your your skeleton um like why our skeletons are the particular weird shape
    that they are how we sort of developed from our Origins as fish that turn into
    lizards that turn into squirrels that turn into monkeys that turn into Apes that
    turn into us um because it matters a lot um evolution of our eye is another odd
    story uh the our retina is backwards in some pretty interesting ways like it&amp;#39;s
    not it&amp;#39;s like flipped in the direction that you would expect it to be
    like you would expect that the light sensing aspects of it will be facing towards
    the light but they&amp;#39;re actually backwards they face back and they kind
    of have to bounce through and this is thought to be related to like when we crawled
    out of the ocean and our eyes kind of inverted to allow the same kind of refraction
    to happen um yeah so uh we didn&amp;#39;t talk in this particular story about
    eye movements eye movements we will talk about also in some detail um I we have
    we humans have very mobile eyes that&amp;#39;s a very Cornerstone aspect of our
    visual system is that our eyes move a lot um it is part of the motor system to
    be able to move any part of your body including the eyes and that specific area
    is called ocul motor control oculo eye motor movement oculo motor is sort of stuff
    related to eye movements um and so things like ocul motor control is obviously
    very overlapping with things like visual perception and perceptual Neuroscience
    because as we move our eyes the information on the retina changes and we have
    to make and we make decisions about where to move our eyes in the same way we
    make decisions about where to move our our arms but this is also a place that
    like as like we you can live a whole happy life and like never really think about
    your eye movements but once you start thinking about your eye movements you&amp;#39;ll
    realize that it&amp;#39;s I think about it a lot like it&amp;#39;s it feels a
    lot like breathing to me where usually your breathing is something that just happens
    on its own but you can control it to some EXT like I can hold my breath I can
    take a breath I can do that I have volitional control over my breathing in a way
    that I don&amp;#39;t over my heart um and our eye movements are kind of like that
    as well like I can choose to look one place or another um I can choose not to
    look at something um but for the most part for 99.9% of my Waking Life my eyes
    are just kind of doing what they do um and being driven by a combination of a
    ailable visual information and my desires of the world and sometimes like if I
    throw something in the air I will look at it and then catch it and there&amp;#39;s
    a lot of that process that is happening just below that level of conscious awareness
    um and that I think is a nice enough segue into we&amp;#39;re going to talk about
    for the last 10 minutes which is methods methodologies um methods is kind of a
    it&amp;#39;s just just the term that we use for like how in God&amp;#39;s name
    are you going to study any of this that&amp;#39;s kind of what methods means and
    generally speaking when we talk about methods we&amp;#39;re talking about um equipment
    and and ways that we can do empirical measurements of the world that will give
    us information about parts of the world that we think might we might be able to
    glean some insight into these deeper weirder aspects of the this is another great
    term desiderata of our investigation desiderata means that which is desired um
    and it is a sort of philosophy of science term about what are you trying to figure
    out you came into this room as a scientist because you have a certain there&amp;#39;s
    something you want to know more about there&amp;#39;s some part of the world that
    you want to gain insight into what is that thing and how how can you do it given
    all the limitations and straints and sort of difficulties of like how the world
    is um for me in for me in my sort of domain of inquiry um I I use two primary
    uh research tools map which is sort for motion capture um which is the thing if
    you see like behind the scenes stuff in movies and video games like the suit with
    the dots and stuff like that that&amp;#39;s motion capture and that&amp;#39;s
    basically related to um moving the body like sort of recording the movement of
    the body um in space and I will be at one of the lab sections I will be showing
    um I&amp;#39;ll be bringing in some cameras and doing a freeo cap recording which
    is the open source software that I&amp;#39;ve been building um which is designed
    to like help um record the body with a high degree of fidelity um like this specific
    three-dimensional configuration of the body at any given moment in time because
    you know I would love to be able to study all the Bing activity of the pingi cells
    and the cerebellum but that&amp;#39;s not available to me in this year of Our
    Lord 2025 um I can&amp;#39;t actually get that measurement and the methods that
    I could use even if we if we if we could get that from something like fmri which
    is like the tube that you get the sort of colorful pictures of the brain um in
    this current moment in technology I can&amp;#39;t use that type of a tool and
    also have a person out in the world throwing and catching and doing stuff like
    that um and so we use motion capture as a methodology to record the 3D configuration
    of the body over time then we use those movements to try to infer while if the
    if the arm did this and gravity is like that then the muscles must have done this
    or that in order to produce the forces that generated that movement and then you
    kind of backtrack from well if the mo if the muscles did this then the spine must
    have done that and sort of you can use this kind of like this observable aspect
    of reality which is like the location of the arm measure it to the level of fidelity
    that you can with the available technology that you have and then use those empirical
    measurements to try to infer all this weird goopy nonsense of what I&amp;#39;ve
    been talking about about this part of the brain that part of the brain that part
    of the brain um the other technology that I tend to use a lot is I can draw on
    this board ey tracking which everybody loves eye tracking um it&amp;#39;s always
    a crowd favorite um but that&amp;#39;s another sort of like there&amp;#39;s different
    tools to use it but mostly these days we use video- based eye trackers which is
    literally just little cameras pointed at the eye and it&amp;#39;s kind of a a
    convenient thing that we are as humans um have these highly mobile eyes um that
    sort of wind up giving this really interesting readout of what my brain wanted
    to get more information about at each moment in time so if you give me a task
    like walking over rough terrain or sort of juggling or throwing and catching or
    something like that um you can look at the movement of my eye and at the very
    least know the visual information that was available to me in that moment by doing
    sort of 3D modeling and sort of saying okay the eye moved this way and then this
    the object was over here and so you know you know based on what I know about the
    eye I couldn&amp;#39;t see it then or I could see it in my periphery um and then
    I chose to make a movement that would align my eye so now it&amp;#39;s in my phobia
    and so you can use just like a camera pointed at the eye to tell the information
    that was being transmitted into my visual cortex and sort of going down that way
    which both gives you the information that I had available and more importantly
    arguably the place that my eyes move to tells me the place that my central nervous
    system decided I want more information from this part of the world and because
    those eye movements tend to happen really really fast like you know 150 milliseconds
    per eye movement if you&amp;#39;re doing a difficult task um like well below the
    level of conscious awareness we can tell stories about what we were doing after
    the fact but in the moment the eyes just kind of go where they need to go um and
    so I can tell both what information was available to this weird magical meat robot
    at any moment in time and I can also look at the decisions that were made of oh
    I&amp;#39;m going to move my eyes this way and not that way until where my central
    nervous system desired more information from in the world at any moment in time
    and so in the by the combination of these things of being able to measure the
    sort of the perceptual input in the form of eye tracking and the motor output
    in the form of motion capture um Wei this is my general attempt is to my my general
    approach to scientific research is to try to combine these two methodologies to
    give a sense of like get a picture of what&amp;#39;s h of what a given of a what
    a human is doing in the world as they sort of perform complex actions and then
    use that weird pile of data that pours out of those machines to give some insight
    into this stuff often in my particular case in the sort of conversation of science
    um I I this domain this typ type of research tends to give ecologically valid
    like like realist like it&amp;#39;s real data of real people doing real stuff
    but the Fidelity is just limited like there&amp;#39;s only the the accuracy and
    precision of information that I can provide with these methods is just very very
    limited relative to someone who&amp;#39;s in a lab pulling out individual neurons
    and sort of doing all the reductionist work that they can do to get really precise
    numbers so the so the the sociology of Sciences people like me doing the broad
    scoke type of research work with people who to the more careful reduction of stuff
    and ideally we kind of we both work together so that we can tell more complete
    stories and tell more satisfying cartoon stories of what&amp;#39;s going on for
    humans to new generations of undergrads every every year or two okay get all that
    covered no more questions Neuroscience nailed it great cool well actually that&amp;#39;s
    it as there any um any we do have like three more minutes does anyone have any
    questions or what&amp;#39;s the word emotional outbursts uh exential crises uh
    things I wish you wish I&amp;#39;d said more about no one would say anything in
    this moment in class I appreciate oh you do like the phon thing about the yeah
    yeah opson opson is that&amp;#39;s the term Ops i n reminded me of like yeah yeah
    it&amp;#39;s the same I mean plants don&amp;#39;t really have the motor aspect
    but yeah that&amp;#39;s for the biochemistry people I think it&amp;#39;s the opson
    is the part that has the more there&amp;#39;s a lot of lot of depth there there&amp;#39;s
    only it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like a class of chemical and so you can you can
    look at that okay um great thank you for showing up um keep an eye on the Discord
    server Discord server and canvas I&amp;#39;ll make an announcement about the actual
    assignments going on um and uh yeah see you on m not an assignment to this what&amp;#39;s
    that so no assign this Sunday no not this Sunday and then I guess Monday is a
    holiday so I&amp;#39;ll see you in a week yeah someone here told me that which
    I was it you somebody told me someone told me that there was a holiday yeah thank
    you appreciate that I probably would have figured it out I didn&amp;#39;t have
    either one of them yeah I think it was just those two yeah exactly H okay

    text: "We are recording now. To repeat that, the proper assignment, like the poster\
      \ proposal assignment, will be a one or two sentence write-up on the topic area\
      \ that you want your poster to be on and a singular citation of a paper that\
      \ represents the research in the area you will be presenting on. The standard\
      \ assignment for 22.99 is that you are supposed to pick a singular paper for\
      \ the whole semester, and your poster will be you presenting just that paper.\
      \ I think we can go a little bit beyond that. If that\u2019s all you want to\
      \ do, that\u2019s totally valid, but I think we can do a more broad overview.\
      \ To keep us honest, I\u2019m going to ask you to pick a singular paper, and\
      \ the bot-mediated conversation will be designed to help you do that. If you\
      \ provide a topic that you want to study, and a paper you\u2019re considering,\
      \ along with the abstract, I\u2019ll prompt the bot to ask you the kind of questions\
      \ I would ask you if I had the time and energy to sit down and talk about it.\n\
      \nBehind the scenes, when they talk about this class, most of what they tell\
      \ us is to help you avoid picking a review article for your paper and to choose\
      \ an actual empirical research article. If you just search for papers on a given\
      \ topic, you\u2019re likely to find review articles at the top of that list,\
      \ and it\u2019s not always obvious whether you\u2019re looking at a review article,\
      \ a book chapter, or an empirical study. I can instruct the bot to assist you\
      \ with that. It will ask about methodologies, topics, and help you navigate\
      \ the dense language that abstracts or scientific papers are typically written\
      \ in. There will also be a simple checkbox-style Canvas assignment and a Discord\
      \ server-based conversation space. These will be due next week, meaning 11:59\
      \ p.m. on Sunday before the following Monday. If you don\u2019t meet that deadline,\
      \ there will be dire consequences. Not really, but we want to keep everyone\
      \ on the same path.\n\nProbably by the end of next week, I will have implemented\
      \ features where the bot will track a profile of your interests and help you\
      \ on your journey through this general field. We\u2019ll see how that goes.\
      \ Every time I make a promise about the future, just know that internally, I\
      \ am screaming.\n\nGreat, okay, let\u2019s go ahead and get into it. I realize\
      \ I forgot some tracking equipment that I intended to bring today, so I will\
      \ use this instead. Alright, let us begin the lecture proper. It has been nice\
      \ to see you guys talking about your interests in the server, interacting with\
      \ the bot about what you want to study. I wanted to have that part happen first\
      \ before I talked too much about my own perspective on this space. I didn\u2019\
      t want to impose my view on you before allowing you to think for yourselves.\n\
      \nThe next chunk of time will provide an overview of the domain of human-centered\
      \ neuroscience, primarily related to my own research background and studies.\
      \ As you develop your own specialties and personal experiences, you will chart\
      \ your own path and trajectory into the heart of some field or domain. For everyone\
      \ who chooses to follow such a route, each person will have a unique path and\
      \ different topics relevant to their interests. I don\u2019t want to present\
      \ this information as if it is everything that matters or is relevant to this\
      \ topic. \n\nI want to maintain a relatively personalized narrative, covering\
      \ the topics that are most important for me to study human perceptual-motor\
      \ neuroscience as I have learned how to do so. The beauty of using AI-mediated\
      \ tools in a classroom is that traditionally, the professor lays out the curriculum,\
      \ structure, and topics, constraining everyone to that structure for practical\
      \ reasons\u2014it\u2019s too hard to mediate the varying interests of people\
      \ in a room labeled under one course title. However, I believe that with the\
      \ AI, it will do its best to make your interests relevant to the topics I have\
      \ mandated it care about.\n\nAs I go through this material, I encourage you\
      \ to key into your own personal feelings of interest and the topics that move\
      \ you. If you want to follow the trajectories I\u2019m presenting, that\u2019\
      s fine, but you will ultimately have your unique experience because that\u2019\
      s how the world works. During this lecture, my main request is that you keep\
      \ your brain engaged. I will talk quickly about various unfamiliar topics. For\
      \ some of you, this may be the first time you\u2019re hearing these concepts.\
      \ The goal is not for you to understand everything I\u2019m saying, but to expose\
      \ you to it. As I start, try not to get too hung up on whether you\u2019re following\
      \ along with everything. Remember the key terms as best you can, and let the\
      \ information wash over you. I assure you that some of it will resonate. Later,\
      \ when we open things back up, you can begin asking the bot or your neighbors\
      \ about the parts that you found most interesting."

    text: "What is most gratifying about doing this type of class is the discovery,\
      \ every time empirically, that when I give a lecture on a given topic and then\
      \ I say to 40 students, \"Ask the bot about the parts you found most interesting,\"\
      \ typically what I see from that is 40 different conversations about 40 different\
      \ topics. That is really a lot of fun. \n\nSo, with that said, let us get into\
      \ it. Unfortunately, I intended to bring a tablet so I could draw with colors,\
      \ and I brought the tablet but then, when I looked for the pen, I found I had\
      \ just thrown a standard pencil into here, which I can\u2019t even imagine what\
      \ was going on when I did that. So we\u2019re going to do it old school with\
      \ just a singular color. But that\u2019s okay. \n\nLet\u2019s see, moving over\
      \ here. So, it was your fault; how dare you! Okay, I\u2019ll just put it on\
      \ your bill. \n\nRight, so the topic of the course is neuroscience, and the\
      \ department is biology. Most of you, as biology majors, have internalized to\
      \ some degree or another the understanding that biology and neuroscience are\
      \ related to things like cells and neurons and wet lab microscope types of conversations.\
      \ That is super valid! Those are good topics and important things to look at,\
      \ all kind of part and parcel with a particular philosophical tradition that\
      \ is fundamental to the way we conduct scientific research in 2025 on Earth.\
      \ We often don\u2019t even think about it, and that is the concept of reductionism.\
      \ \n\nSo, reductionism is a general philosophical approach to the study of the\
      \ natural world, attempting to break things down into smaller and smaller pieces\
      \ so that you can make more and more precise measurements and more precise investigations.\
      \ There\u2019s an implicit assumption that by looking at the component pieces\
      \ of the world, you will be able to get a sense of the holistic view of how\
      \ everything works. There is a lot of validity to that approach, but there are\
      \ also significant limitations because if you\u2019re only looking at the small\
      \ pieces in isolation, you\u2019re going to have a hard time seeing what we\
      \ call emergent properties. These are things that really only come about when\
      \ you look at the combination of things at a larger scale than the kinds of\
      \ things you can put into a test tube and under a microscope.\n\nA classic example\
      \ of emergence is traffic; traffic is a property of cars on a road. However,\
      \ you can never understand traffic by looking at a singular car. It\u2019s something\
      \ that only really comes about when you look at the cars operating in their\
      \ natural environment. The counter to reductionism is often referred to as holism,\
      \ and my research domain tends to operate at that scale. I tend not to look\
      \ at the research of people who are doing the highly reduced electrophysiology\
      \ studies, where they put electrodes into the brains of various animals, or\
      \ fMRI studies, where they examine the magnetic resonance of hemoglobin in the\
      \ brain.\n\nMy particular research domain tends to focus on humans behaving\
      \ in natural environments, engaging in the kinds of activities we do in our\
      \ day-to-day lives. For instance, throwing things in the air and catching them\
      \ involves a motor behavior of applying force to the marker, an information-gathering\
      \ phase, and then another motor command. If everything aligns correctly, the\
      \ throw works out; if it doesn\u2019t, I drop it. I am trying to understand\
      \ that behavioral process in its natural context and then using the best measurements\
      \ that I can come up with of those behaviors, trying to attach them to the lower-level\
      \ reductionist fields of inquiry so we can understand how things like cells\
      \ and neurons can lead to such complex behaviors. \n\nI think of it as almost\
      \ a robotics approach. I like to tell people that I study the part of neuroscience\
      \ that overlaps with robotics because robotics is another field that keeps you\
      \ honest. In robotics, you make things that move in the real world, so you can\u2019\
      t really cut many corners; otherwise, the device just stops working. The difference\
      \ is that with robots, we know how they work because we made them, but they\
      \ can\u2019t do all the things we want. Humans, on the other hand, we don\u2019\
      t fully understand how they work, but they can do pretty much anything. \n\n\
      There\u2019s an interesting combination there: thinking about humans as magical\
      \ meat robots and trying to study and understand them from that perspective\
      \ can lead to many useful results. The great thing about this method is the\
      \ abstraction away from the biology and understanding that beneath it all are\
      \ cells, neurons, membrane potentials, and so on. This allows us to think more\
      \ in terms of the aspects we can measure, which we will talk about shortly.\
      \ \n\nSpeaking of the natural world, let\u2019s talk about one of the ways to\
      \ parse out that general topic, which is called the perception-action cycle.\
      \ Let\u2019s start by drawing a brain. I\u2019m attempting to draw it \u2013\
      \ let\u2019s do it like this. Here\u2019s how you draw a brain. There you go.\
      \ This is your brain; this is a picture of your brain. That\u2019s your temporal\
      \ lobe, and this is your eye. You\u2019re facing that way. \n\nThere are a lot\
      \ of details not covered here, but this gives the general shape. So here you\
      \ are; this is you and your existence in the world. Let\u2019s see, let\u2019\
      s do this another way: there you go. That\u2019s you. You\u2019re in the world,\
      \ and here\u2019s your body. Here\u2019s your eye, here\u2019s your mouth, and\
      \ inside there\u2019s your brain \u2013 not to scale. As you are in the world,\
      \ you have a very limited awareness of your context, and everything you know\
      \ comes in through your senses and your memory.\n\nLet\u2019s think about a\
      \ particular moment in time where you, sitting here, see a cat. You like cats,\
      \ so light from the sun bounces off the cat and goes into your eye. We\u2019\
      ll talk a lot about eyes, the lens, the retina, the fovea, and the optic nerve.\
      \ But the main thing to note is that your eye is the place where environmental\
      \ energy is first absorbed by your nervous system. This moment right here is\
      \ very special in your perceptual cycle, which is the moment of transduction.\
      \ This is the term for the instant when some form of environmental energy, in\
      \ this case, light, gets transduced and converted into..."

    text: "Neural activity in this particular case, your eye, begins when light enters\
      \ it. The light goes into your retina, specifically into your fovea, which I\
      \ will discuss plenty about later. There is a particular class of molecules\
      \ called opsins. Opsins look roughly like a combination of carbons and hydrogens,\
      \ with a hexagonal shape and a long, wiggly tail. People in biochemistry will\
      \ likely be familiar with these shapes, although this is not drawn well.\n\n\
      In your eye, there are several opsins; basically, there are three main types,\
      \ and they are each tuned, if you want to use that term, to different wavelengths\
      \ of light. The nature of these opsins is such that when a photon of light hits\
      \ them, they absorb the energy of that photon and then change shape. I think\
      \ I actually did this backwards; I think they start out with a kink and then\
      \ straighten out when they absorb the light. However, the important point here\
      \ is that this absorption of a photon changes the electrochemical properties\
      \ of the opsin molecule, converting it from neutral to a positive or negative\
      \ charge.\n\nThe light coming from the environment, reflected off an object\
      \ and entering your eye, changes the chemical structure of the opsin. This happens\
      \ in the trillions and billions of instances that biology operates within. This\
      \ change affects the polarity and the electrical state of the rods and cones\
      \ in your retina, which are then processed by ganglia and various other components.\
      \ This leads to a shift in the electrical potential in that section of your\
      \ retina, which is then sent as spikes down your optic nerve.\n\nNeurons, which\
      \ are the fundamental units of neuroscience, communicate through these spikes,\
      \ sending small electrical pulses to indicate that something has occurred within\
      \ the neuron. For perception and vision, it is the absorption of light into\
      \ the opsin and the subsequent shift in electrical state that results in a change\
      \ in the spike rate of a given ganglion cell. The axon of this ganglion cell\
      \ transmits information down the optic nerve into your occipital lobe, specifically\
      \ the visual cortex.\n\nWe will discuss this in more detail and coherence later.\
      \ The important takeaway here is that the light absorbed by your eye is converted,\
      \ through this biochemical process, into a pattern of neural activity. Because\
      \ this neural activity is caused by light reflected off an object, there is\
      \ a general belief and assumption that the pattern of neural activity has some\
      \ relationship with the real-world object. There is some statistical correlation\
      \ and a relationship that encodes information about the world you are observing.\n\
      \nThe nature of that relationship is tenuous and complex and, generally speaking,\
      \ extremely impoverished. The actual information we receive in any moment is\
      \ far less than you might think it is. The richness of your visual environment,\
      \ for example, is largely an illusion, created by your brain's ability to assemble\
      \ noisy information into something accurate enough to navigate through the world,\
      \ yet often in an after-the-fact manner.\n\nSo, light enters your eye, gets\
      \ absorbed by the retina, which is located at the back of your eye, and sends\
      \ a pattern of neural activity down your optic nerve. This neural activity passes\
      \ through some subcortical areas, including the thalamus, and then projects\
      \ down to the occipital lobe, which is commonly referred to as the visual cortex\
      \ at the back of your brain. While it's not crucial to know where it is, it\
      \ is significant that this is where the first processing of visual information\
      \ begins.\n\nThis primary visual cortex, V1, computes basic features such as\
      \ edges, dark patches, and light patches. After V1, the visual information undergoes\
      \ further processing, leading to more complex structures. You begin with edges,\
      \ then can form patches; from patches, you can derive textures, and from textures,\
      \ you can recognize objects. Each stage of visual processing builds upon the\
      \ previous one, eventually allowing for object recognition, such as identifying\
      \ a cat in your visual field.\n\nThe processing associated with object recognition\
      \ tends to involve the temporal lobe, while the part we will focus on in this\
      \ class moves in the other direction, more oriented towards using visual information\
      \ to plan movement in the world.\n\nIt is important to note that this description\
      \ is a simplified cartoon version of an incredibly complex story. If we wanted\
      \ to tell the entire story, we would need to relate countless stories of numerous\
      \ researchers collecting data in their labs, coding complex findings into their\
      \ respective papers, and then synthesizing their observations into a coherent\
      \ narrative.\n\nThis cartoonified version is what typically makes it into textbooks\
      \ and is what we communicate back to you, attempting to make sense of it all.\
      \ However, it is essential to remember that this is not the complete story;\
      \ it is a simplified representation. The actual mechanics of these processes\
      \ are unknown to us. There is no single resource that can definitively explain\
      \ what the visual cortex is doing. The best we can do is compile empirical measurements\
      \ collected by researchers over time and tell you the story we\u2019ve collectively\
      \ agreed upon in an attempt to explain how this part of the brain operates.\n\
      \nThat being said, there is a significant gap between epistemology, which pertains\
      \ to our knowledge, and metaphysics, concerning what actually exists. These\
      \ two realms never truly converge; there will always be a distinction between\
      \ knowing something and the reality of that thing. Throughout the history of\
      \ science, many stories have been told about our understanding of the world\
      \ and ourselves. Historically, on a long enough timeline, each of these stories\
      \ has proven wrong in some regard.\n\nEverything we currently believe will eventually\
      \ be challenged and resolved in new ways. Evidence of this can be seen in how\
      \ each idea we've held has ultimately been proven wrong in some sense. So, as\
      \ you might think today represents something special that will remain true indefinitely\u2014\
      until the sun burns out\u2014consider the beauty of the scientific process.\
      \ Even though previous beliefs have been disproven, there is a continuity of\
      \ progress, with each successive idea being somewhat less incorrect than the\
      \ last.  "

      \ base-level beliefs about how certain things work. But yeah, it\u2019s a continuous\
      \ process. We\u2019ll talk about it. Yes, so here we are in this cycle. The\
      \ light has bounced off the cat, it's hit your eye, it's been absorbed, and\
      \ it's been transmitted back to your visual cortex. You have identified that\
      \ it\u2019s a cat, and you have an inbuilt volition that says, 'I like to touch\
      \ cats.' Great, we support this for you. So this is the parietal lobe. Don\u2019\
      t worry about the parietal lobe. It's great, but you can worry about it if you\
      \ want. The important part is this back here is your visual cortex. This on\
      \ the side here, roughly speaking, is your motor cortex.\n\nEventually, as you\
      \ look at more pictures of the brain, you will notice that the wrinkles and\
      \ stuff on the brain are not random. They are conserved in the same sense that\
      \ while every face we have looks very different, they generally have two eyes,\
      \ a nose, and a mouth in just different configurations. The wrinkly stuff and\
      \ the crevices and bumps on our brain are roughly the same. If you were to crack\
      \ open all the brains in this room, which I don\u2019t recommend, you would\
      \ find a lot of correspondence in where the big creases and stuff come in. I\
      \ am not at the level of that anatomy where I can name them off the top of my\
      \ head, but I do recognize them in pictures. It\u2019s easy to tell when someone\
      \ is drawing a brain artistically versus when they\u2019re looking at anatomy\
      \ because artists often just say, 'Oh yeah, it\u2019s a bunch of pink wrinkles.'\
      \ That\u2019s not actually how we do it. \n\nAnyways, there\u2019s a big one\
      \ right in the middle called the central sulcus. The sulcus is like the crease\
      \ part, and on this side of that sulcus is the somatosensory cortex. Somatosensation\
      \ is essentially touch. Think of that type of sensation. On the opposite side\
      \ is the motor cortex. The sensory cortex and then the motor cortex tend to\
      \ be paired, and you can look up the homunculus when we discuss the motor cortex.\
      \ I enjoy this distinction. There are these two sides of the brain where on\
      \ one side it's kind of like sensation and perception of the world\u2014including\
      \ visual aspects\u2014and on the other side is where we begin to engage in motor\
      \ actions and movements and the outgoing parts of things. As we keep going forward,\
      \ we eventually reach the frontal lobes. The frontal lobe is the big lumpy part\
      \ in the front. That\u2019s the most human part of the brain. All mammal brains\
      \ are roughly the same anatomically; they\u2019re just mirrored into different\
      \ shapes and sizes. For example, rats have a much more pronounced olfactory\
      \ bulb for smell compared to their visual cortex, and the human brain has a\
      \ lot of extra anatomy in the frontal lobe area. \n\nThis area is thought to\
      \ be where decision-making comes from. This is where language often resides\
      \ and is referenced often in executive function, the feeling of deciding what\
      \ you want to do. This is also where metacognition happens. If you\u2019re having\
      \ thoughts about your thoughts, like, 'Oh yeah, I\u2019m angry right now,' that\u2019\
      s a frontal lobe area. Just reiterating the point, every time I point to a part\
      \ of the brain and say, 'This is the part that does this thing,' a little part\
      \ of me inside is screaming because none of this is how any of it really works.\
      \ That\u2019s not how the real world is set up; it\u2019s much more complex\
      \ and much noisier than that. But if I say, 'This is where executive function\
      \ happens,' and I point at the front of the brain, then say, 'This is where\
      \ vision happens,' and I point at the back of the brain, that statement is more\
      \ true than if I switch those two things around. It\u2019s important to reiterate\
      \ that even though I am telling you these simplified stories\u2014these textbook-level\
      \ conversations about how the brain works\u2014this is the stuff that if we\
      \ come back to this class in 250 years, we will be saying very different things.\
      \ However, we\u2019ll probably still say something like vision happens in the\
      \ back and cognition happens in the front. \n\nFrom this frontal lobe, you get\
      \ executive functions, then you get your premotor area, and somewhere around\
      \ here is where volitions arise. Volition is sort of the same root as voluntary;\
      \ it\u2019s the things that you want to do. You see the cat, and you say, 'I\
      \ want to touch the cat.' Here\u2019s the cat, and look at me, I\u2019m touching\
      \ it. That\u2019s what I want to happen. Now you are in this state where here\u2019\
      s your body, here\u2019s your hand, there\u2019s this cat, and here\u2019s this\
      \ desire: you wish that your hand was on this cat. There is now a gap between\
      \ the way the world is in your perception and the way that you wish the world\
      \ would be, which is that your hand is touching this object. Those volitions\
      \ kind of meld with the perceptual experience, and from this sort of alchemy\
      \ emerges something resembling a motor plan. \n\nI\u2019m trying to stop myself\
      \ from going into too much detail because we\u2019re going to have a whole lecture\
      \ about the eye, a whole lecture about the motor cortex, and we\u2019re going\
      \ to talk about this in more detail. I\u2019m just giving the overview. But\
      \ this is when we first start seeing something resembling a motor plan. There\
      \ are many times in the chats you all have been having where you talk about\
      \ things like muscle memory. Muscle memory is a term we like to use; it\u2019\
      s a very standard human expression. However, it\u2019s also one of those things\
      \ that doesn\u2019t really exist in a physiological sense. Your muscles don\u2019\
      t have memory; they\u2019re much simpler objects which we will discuss too.\
      \ Typically, when you refer to muscle memory, you actually mean motor plan.\
      \ As you work on something more and more and gain more expertise and experience,\
      \ what we tend to refer to as muscle memory is really the motor plans becoming\
      \ more robust and more locked in. Typically, where a lot of that kind of motor\
      \ planning takes place is not necessarily in the motor cortex; most of that\
      \ starts happening in subcortical regions. \n\nIf you think about a picture\
      \ of the brain and visualize that pink wrinkly thing in your skull, that tends\
      \ to be what we think about as the cortex, the neocortex\u2014the part where\
      \ most of the processing happens. I like to talk about this like it\u2019s the\
      \ bloom of a rose on a rose bush. When you focus on a rose bush, it makes a\
      \ lot of sense that we tend to focus on the rose\u2014the red thing with petals\
      \ that smells nice. We spend a lot of our time focusing on that part of the\
      \ plant for very good reason. But if you take a step back and look at it from\
      \ a botany point of view, it\u2019s mostly bush with just a little bit of rose.\
      \ I think that\u2019s somewhat the same with the way our cortex works. The majority\
      \ of our central nervous system is not in that cortex; it\u2019s in the subcortical\
      \ regions."

    text: "The human cerebellum contains many neurons, more than the rest of your\
      \ central nervous system combined. This number is strangely conserved across\
      \ different animals, particularly mammals. While we all have a cortex and a\
      \ cerebellum, we have very different brain-to-body ratios and proportions. However,\
      \ regardless of how big your brain is or what animal you are, your cerebellum\
      \ has three and a half times as many neurons as the rest of your cortex. I always\
      \ come back to this fact because it seems interesting that you can find a number\
      \ in nature conserved across various species. I wish I knew more about it.\n\
      \nThe reason the cerebellum has so many more neurons, by count, is that the\
      \ neurons associated with it are very tiny. You have granule cells and Purkinje\
      \ cells. I need to look up pictures of these because Purkinje cells are some\
      \ of the more beautiful parts of the brain. You have the cell body, the axon,\
      \ and then there are all the synapses\u2014thousands upon thousands of them.\
      \ This is a famous image, actually taken by Ramon y Cajal, who was part of the\
      \ group that developed staining mechanisms that allowed us to begin examining\
      \ isolated neurons around 1909. Before that, we didn\u2019t really know what\
      \ neurons were or if they formed one big mass or individualized pieces. There\
      \ was a significant scientific and philosophical debate about whether the brain\
      \ was all one interconnected entity or if the neurons were separated from one\
      \ another.\n\nRamon y Cajal argued for the synapse doctrine, proposing that\
      \ there was a gap between neurons. In contrast, another scientist, Golgi, argued\
      \ that they were all interconnected. Golgi created a silver nitrate staining\
      \ process that ultimately provided evidence supporting Cajal\u2019s theory\u2014\
      demonstrating that neurons do not touch. Both Cajal and Golgi shared a Nobel\
      \ Prize, but apparently, they had such bad blood that during their acceptance\
      \ speeches, they spent the entire time criticizing each other.\n\nYour cerebellum\
      \ consists of Purkinje cells and granule cells. The granule cells are smaller\
      \ and do not have the long fibers that reach long distances; they are much more\
      \ localized and connect only to their immediate neighbors. The majority of neurons\
      \ in your nervous system are these granule cells located in your cerebellum,\
      \ which has a layered structure like most parts of the brain. Typically, the\
      \ outer layers consist of newer structures, while the inner layers are more\
      \ ancient.\n\nWe may discuss this structure further if there\u2019s enough interest\
      \ in class. But for now, let\u2019s talk about how light hits your retina when\
      \ you see a cat. This light is absorbed, tweaking your opsins, triggering a\
      \ neural cascade that vibrates your visual cortex and gives you the perception\
      \ of a cat. Your desire to touch the cat, combined with the knowledge of its\
      \ presence, leads to the creation of a motor plan.\n\nThis process, illustrated\
      \ in a rather cartoonish manner, involves a lot of complexity and debate regarding\
      \ its steps. Simply put, something in the combination of your motor cortex and\
      \ your cerebellum\u2014which primarily deals with body movement\u2014plays a\
      \ significant role. It\u2019s thought that this is related to tool use; the\
      \ ability of humans to quickly learn the physics of an object when picking it\
      \ up and using it as a tool is a function of the neocortex\u2014 the newer part\
      \ of the brain responsible for more complex functions.\n\nAt the higher levels\
      \ of the motor system, mainly within the frontal lobe, plans become more abstract.\
      \ For example, you might think, \"I\u2019m thirsty; I wish I had water right\
      \ now.\" To turn that high-level desire into action, there must be a narrowing\
      \ down of specificity, ultimately leading to muscle firings that move your body\
      \ through space. When you see water over there, that volition is converted into\
      \ motor commands to move your legs so you can reach for the water, open the\
      \ container, and drink.\n\nThis transition involves the motor cortex, then the\
      \ cerebellum, which connects to the brainstem, wrapped around each other. The\
      \ brainstem, which includes the medulla oblongata and the pons, manages functions\
      \ like regulating your heartbeat, breathing, and controlling your body temperature.\
      \ These processes are typically managed by the brainstem.\n\nFurthermore, the\
      \ spinal cord, which is part of your central nervous system, is often overlooked\
      \ compared to the rest of the nervous system. Many illustrations of the central\
      \ nervous system disproportionately highlight the brain, ignoring the spinal\
      \ cord, despite it being integral to nervous system function. The central nervous\
      \ system, which encompasses the brain and spinal cord, is where processing occurs.\
      \ Processing, which is a vague term, essentially means that information comes\
      \ in, undergoes some sort of conversion, and then information goes out. Your\
      \ spine is also involved in this form of processing at various levels, which\
      \ we will discuss further."

      \ occurs in the spine itself.\n\nYour spine extends down to the spinal cord,\
      \ which actually ends right below your thoracic spine. Below that is what\u2019\
      s called the cauda equina, where it becomes more like an extension cord. At\
      \ this point, you begin to lose gray matter, gaining more peripheral nerves\
      \ that extend to your limbs.\n\nI want to emphasize the distinction between\
      \ the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. This distinction\
      \ is often stated as a hard delineation, but there is a lot of gray area. One\
      \ classic gray area is the retina, which contains many neurons and layers. We\
      \ often think of the retina as the eye, a classical sensory organ, but there\
      \ are processes happening in the retina before any information passes onto the\
      \ optic nerve to the brain that could be considered computation. Similarly,\
      \ your skin has many connections that might also perform computations. For instance,\
      \ when you get hurt, rubbing the affected area suppresses the pain signals because\
      \ the activation of sensory organs around the damaged area reduces the sensation\
      \ coming from it. This occurs at the level of your skin.\n\nThese names and\
      \ terms we use are constructs we created to make sense of nature. They are not\
      \ divisions that nature inherently has. When we assign names or labels, we make\
      \ concessions and draw lines to facilitate discussions, yet there will always\
      \ be gray areas. Often, it\u2019s these gray areas that lead us to abandon certain\
      \ ideas in favor of others.\n\nSpeaking of the peripheral nervous system, if\
      \ we visualize your arm, you will find your bones play a crucial role. Your\
      \ bones primarily define your shape and ability to move through the world. The\
      \ connective tissues and muscles provide detail, but the general shape of you\
      \ as a creature is defined by these strange sticks we call bones. Muscles, which\
      \ are attached to these bones, enable movement.\n\nWhen thinking holistically\
      \ about how you interact with the world, especially in a laboratory setting,\
      \ a reductionist approach involves simplifying and removing unnecessary factors\
      \ to zoom in on a specific subject. If you're a neuroscientist, you might take\
      \ a mouse, rat, or fruit fly into the lab and remove any extraneous elements\
      \ that do not pertain to neuroscience. However, when trying to understand how\
      \ humans navigate through the world, you cannot ignore elements like bones and\
      \ muscles, even if your primary interest is in the neural or perceptual aspects,\
      \ because the neural activity will ultimately have to translate into movement.\n\
      \nThis touches upon the robotics conversation because the neural activity, which\
      \ starts as a sensory experience of vision, eventually converts into mechanical\
      \ energy. This energy generates movement; muscles contract, and arms move. The\
      \ energy from this movement can be identified as kinetic or mechanical energy.\n\
      \nThe perception-action cycle demonstrates this conversion of environmental\
      \ energy into neural activity that, in turn, produces motor actions. Muscles\
      \ act as variable stiffness springs, meaning they can only pull; they cannot\
      \ push. What appears as pushing is actually the muscle pulling on the bone to\
      \ facilitate movement, which is called extension. To perform a flexion, motor\
      \ commands sent cause the surrounding muscle tissue to contract, transforming\
      \ a relatively soft spring into a stiff spring, pulling the joint together.\
      \ This coordination involves paired muscle groups: one for flexion and another\
      \ for extension.\n\nMotor commands originate from the motor cortex, passing\
      \ through the cerebellum in more advanced animals, such as humans, via the corticospinal\
      \ tract. This pathway connects the motor cortex directly to the spine, bypassing\
      \ areas like the cerebellum. While all animals possess a corticospinal tract,\
      \ it varies across species, making it an interesting distinction in the animal\
      \ kingdom. I often use this question to test AI models to assess their understanding\
      \ of neuroscience, particularly how they handle questions about the corticospinal\
      \ tract and variations across the animal kingdom, which often reveal subtle\
      \ complexities in their responses. The information I discussed about how motor\
      \ commands traverse through various areas of the brain remains true, yet the\
      \ corticospinal tract is a critical concept, and anytime you see a term like\
      \ this, just think of the 'o' as a slash, so cortico-spinal becomes C cortex\
      \ SL."

    text: "The spinal cord essentially goes straight from the cortex down to the spine,\
      \ bypassing all the subcortical regions. This pathway enables us to control\
      \ our individual degrees of freedom of our body directly, rather than doing\
      \ things in a more synergistic way, which is deeper than I want to discuss in\
      \ this particular lecture. I'm almost there; it's quite distracting. Here I\
      \ am, close to touching this cat. My motor plan, which has come down from on\
      \ high through the hierarchical structure of our motor system, has taken into\
      \ account my awareness of the world and my own body. My vision provides me with\
      \ information about remote parts of the world\u2014things I cannot touch, which\
      \ are outside my immediate reach. Here's a great term: peripersonal space. Peripersonal\
      \ space is the area that I can touch with my hands. Beyond that is a different\
      \ part of the world, which is happening in the parietal lobe. One of my favorite\
      \ studies involved a monkey that was trained to grab items from a desk. Then,\
      \ they induced a temporary lesion in the part of the brain responsible for that\
      \ peripersonal perception, causing the monkey to lose its ability to see objects\
      \ in that zone. They subsequently taught the monkey to use a grabber arm, which\
      \ extended its reach. After training the monkey to use it, they found that the\
      \ blind spot increased to include the region that could now be reached with\
      \ the grabber, in addition to the hand. Put that into your worldview and see\
      \ how it fits. Here I am, perceiving this cat, while being aware of my body.\
      \ Much of this can be associated with proprioception. As my arm extends, it\
      \ exerts force on my joints due to its weight. My body can encode and is aware\
      \ of those forces, allowing me to be conscious of where my arm is. I can see\
      \ my arm, and I also have a memory of lifting it. We have multiple ways of knowing\
      \ where our bodies are. I know that if I can make this part move this way, I\
      \ will achieve my deepest desire of touching this cat.\n\nThere are complicated\
      \ aspects to this; we don\u2019t move our bodies one joint at a time. We move\
      \ in a sort of intricate dance. Understanding how we break down complex movements\
      \ across the available joints in the context of the world is primarily a function\
      \ of the cerebellum. I relax the flexor and tighten the extensor, which puts\
      \ torque on the bone, and moves my hand. Now I have the reward of cat sensations\
      \ under my hand, and I have achieved my goal. This, then, is one path through\
      \ that perception-action loop. The information has been processed, and having\
      \ moved my body, I have changed the state of the world; my body is now in the\
      \ world. As I perceive the situation, I am perceiving something different. I\
      \ will revisit that loop: we perceive, act, and then take in information. That\
      \ loop is essentially where we spend our entire lives.\n\nThis overview presents\
      \ a simplified version of the processes involved. I will name some fields related\
      \ to what we discussed. Generally speaking, when we talk about the physiology\
      \ of the eyeball, it is referred to as optology, which focuses more on lenses\
      \ and pupils. Once we delve into the neural activity aspect, we refer to it\
      \ as visual or perceptual neuroscience because we are such vision-heavy animals.\
      \ Often, when you hear 'perceptual,' we usually mean 'visual,' but strictly\
      \ speaking, it encompasses all sensory experiences. When discussing the neuroscience\
      \ related to moving our bodies, we typically call that motor neuroscience. You\
      \ will often come across the term perceptual-motor neuroscience, indicating\
      \ the connection between perception and motor control, which are closely linked.\n\
      \nI should mention this: in your peripheral nervous system, you have peripheral\
      \ neurons, which come in two types: perceptual and motor. The distinction is\
      \ defined by the direction in which information is flowing; motor commands go\
      \ out from your central nervous system to your periphery, carrying motor commands.\
      \ This is a neuron connected to a motor unit in my muscle. If it receives input\
      \ from higher-level structures, it will trigger spikes that tell it to fire\
      \ and contract the muscle. Once I touch the cat, the object of my intention,\
      \ the neurons connected to the sensory receptors in my hand start firing differently,\
      \ sending information back through sensory peripheral nerves. Thus, in your\
      \ periphery, the outward signals are your motor neurons, while inward signals\
      \ are your sensory neurons, making this the main distinction in this context.\n\
      \nNow, why are you not aware of all this? One of the most troubling realities\
      \ of being alive is that we have a very thin awareness of what is going on beneath\
      \ the surface in our bodies. We possess some awareness; we can consciously experience\
      \ reaching out and grabbing something, or feeling its texture in our hand. However,\
      \ the more we learn about neuroscience and the complexities of the underlying\
      \ mechanisms, the clearer it becomes that our conscious experiences of motor\
      \ activities are just a thin layer above a vast and intricate system operating\
      \ beneath.\n\nI recall a moment from graduate school when my friends and I were\
      \ in a parking lot waiting to go on a hike. There was a puddle of dirty water\
      \ with an iridescent oil sheen on top. The fractal colors created by the sunlight\
      \ were stunning, yet the oil was merely one molecule thick, floating on dark,\
      \ murky water. This imagery often comes to mind when I think about the nervous\
      \ system. It feels representative of our experience of living in a body: we\
      \ perceive life through a thin veneer atop a deep and complex foundation."

    text: "The complex biological neural system and consciousness are related to the\
      \ depths of what is going on there, but we don't really tend to have access\
      \ to it. For example, I can't feel my stomach deciding when it wants to release\
      \ more enzymes to digest my food, and I can't differentiate between the various\
      \ processes happening. It's just not really available to me. However, once you\
      \ start learning about the bits and pieces, you can begin mapping your conscious\
      \ experiences to what might be happening under the hood. \n\nOne example that\
      \ comes to mind is when a person starts lifting weights for the first time.\
      \ If you've never been involved in weightlifting, there's a phenomenon where\
      \ you can quickly increase the amount of weight you can lift in a short period.\
      \ This happens because your body is learning to fire all of your motor units\
      \ simultaneously. In everyday life, you generally don't tend to do this, but\
      \ you have to learn how to exert maximal effort. This is happening at the level\
      \ of motor unit recruitment. So, when you go to the gym and start experiencing\
      \ increased strength, you can map that experience onto what I just described\
      \ about motor unit functionality. However, that mapping occurs in a cognitive\
      \ space that isn't about deep awareness. \n\nThen, you might ask what it would\
      \ look like if it was in deep awareness. Over time, as you lift weights, you\
      \ reach a plateau. Eventually, you are recruiting all of your motor units, but\
      \ you may not have enough muscle to produce the force needed, which marks the\
      \ beginner spike in performance. During that time, you're not actually increasing\
      \ muscle mass; you're simply learning how to utilize all the muscles you already\
      \ have. Once you hit that plateau, you're firing 100% of your muscle capabilities,\
      \ but your muscles aren't strong enough to move your body. Many of those performance\
      \ plateaus can be tied back to physiological changes and the time courses of\
      \ improvement. For instance, growing muscle takes time, while learning motor\
      \ unit recruitment also takes time but not in the same way. \n\nThat area I've\
      \ been discussing can be referred to as neuromechanics. Neuromechanics is a\
      \ relatively new field, and I'm curious to know if it's part of the terminology\
      \ mesh we discussed in our last session. Neuromechanics lies at the intersection\
      \ of neural activity and mechanics. For instance, firing a motor unit to create\
      \ a spring force that moves a limb raises neuromechanical questions. How that\
      \ connects to spinal central pattern generators is where things get murky. On\
      \ the other side of neuromechanics, you have biomechanics, which is essentially\
      \ Newton's Laws applied to biological systems. We will talk about biomechanics\
      \ with some specificity in the near future. \n\nBiomechanics relates to the\
      \ physics of moving your body. We\u2019re going to describe the body in a way\
      \ that removes biological concepts and considers the human body as an object\
      \ that weighs a lot and is balanced on a relatively narrow platform. This is\
      \ about the center of mass and base of support descriptions of the human body,\
      \ which we will cover in detail soon. \n\nMoreover, I haven\u2019t mentioned\
      \ evolution, which is important because all of these systems are evolved systems\
      \ that developed over billions of years. In the same way you can describe the\
      \ system as it stands now, you will miss part of the story if you don\u2019\
      t consider how it evolved. I haven't quite figured out how to present all these\
      \ topics, but I will be extracting information from your conversations to help\
      \ shape these lectures. There are key points I will cover regardless of what\
      \ you prefer, and evolution is one of those topics. Specifically, I\u2019ll\
      \ talk about the evolution of your eye, along with my interest in the evolution\
      \ of our skeleton. Understanding why our skeletons are shaped the way they are\
      \ and how we evolved from fish to lizards to squirrels to monkeys to apes to\
      \ humans is crucial. The evolution of our eye also tells an interesting story;\
      \ for example, the retina is arranged backwards in ways that might surprise\
      \ you. Rather than facing the light directly, the light-sensing aspects are\
      \ oriented away from it, which is believed to relate to our transition out of\
      \ the ocean.\n\nWe didn\u2019t discuss eye movements in detail yet, but we will,\
      \ as they are a cornerstone of our visual system. Humans have very mobile eyes,\
      \ which is essential for visual functions. This area of study is called oculomotor\
      \ control, which relates to eye movements. Oculomotor control overlaps with\
      \ visual perception and perceptual neuroscience, as the information on the retina\
      \ changes when we move our eyes. Decisions about where to move our eyes are\
      \ similar to those we make when moving any part of our body. You can live a\
      \ happy life and never think about your eye movements, but once you start paying\
      \ attention to them, you may realize that eye movement feels similar to breathing.\
      \ Normally, breathing happens autonomously, but you can exert some volitional\
      \ control\u2014holding your breath or choosing when to take a breath\u2014much\
      \ like how we can decide where to look or choose to ignore something. However,\
      \ for the vast majority of our waking lives, our eyes are driven by a mix of\
      \ visual information and our desires, often beneath the level of conscious awareness.\
      \ \n\nThis leads me to the final topic we will discuss, which is methodologies.\
      \ Methods refer to how we study any of this; basically, how on Earth do you\
      \ intend to investigate these questions? Generally, when we talk about methods,\
      \ we mean the equipment and ways we can empirically measure aspects of the world,\
      \ providing insight into the deeper, more complex facets of our study. This\
      \ introduces another useful term: \"desiderata\"\u2014the essential requirements\
      \ of our investigation."

    text: "Which is desired. It is a sort of philosophy of science term about what\
      \ you are trying to figure out. You came into this room as a scientist because\
      \ there\u2019s something you want to know more about; there\u2019s some part\
      \ of the world that you want to gain insight into. What is that thing, and how\
      \ can you do it given all the limitations and constraints and difficulties of\
      \ how the world is?\n\nIn my domain of inquiry, I use two primary research tools.\
      \ One is motion capture, which you may have seen in behind-the-scenes footage\
      \ of movies and video games. It's the suit with the dots and is basically related\
      \ to recording the movement of the body in space. I will be demonstrating this\
      \ in one of the lab sections. I will be bringing in some cameras and doing a\
      \ freeo cap recording, which is the open-source software that I\u2019ve been\
      \ building, designed to help record the body with a high degree of fidelity,\
      \ capturing the specific three-dimensional configuration of the body at any\
      \ given moment in time. \n\nI would love to study all the activity of the Purkinje\
      \ cells in the cerebellum, but that\u2019s not available to me in this year\
      \ of our Lord, 2025. I can\u2019t actually get that measurement, and the methods\
      \ I could use, such as fMRI, which is the tube that provides the colorful pictures\
      \ of the brain, are not applicable because I can\u2019t use that type of tool\
      \ while also having a person in the world throwing and catching things. Therefore,\
      \ we use motion capture as a methodology to record the 3D configuration of the\
      \ body over time. Then we use those movements to infer that if the arm did this\
      \ and gravity is like that, then the muscles must have done this or that to\
      \ produce the forces that generated that movement. You can backtrack from that:\
      \ if the muscles did this, then the spine must have done that. You can use this\
      \ observable aspect of reality, which is the location of the arm, and measure\
      \ it to the level of fidelity available with the technology you have to infer\
      \ all these complex interactions concerning what I\u2019ve been discussing about\
      \ different parts of the brain.\n\nThe other technology I tend to use a lot\
      \ is eye tracking, which is always a crowd favorite. These days, we mostly use\
      \ video-based eye trackers, which consist of little cameras pointed at the eye.\
      \ It\u2019s a convenient tool because humans have highly mobile eyes, allowing\
      \ us to gather interesting data about what my brain wants to get more information\
      \ about at each moment in time. If you give me a task like walking over rough\
      \ terrain or juggling, you can observe the movement of my eyes. At the very\
      \ least, you know the visual information available to me in that moment by doing\
      \ 3D modeling. You can see where the eye moved and where the object was situated.\
      \ Based on what I know about the eye, you can deduce if I couldn\u2019t see\
      \ it or if I could see it in my periphery, and then you can determine how I\
      \ chose to make a movement to align my eye to see it clearly in my fovea.\n\n\
      By using a camera pointed at the eye, you can tell what information was transmitted\
      \ into my visual cortex. The location where my eyes moved indicates where my\
      \ central nervous system decided, \"I want more information from this part of\
      \ the world.\" These eye movements tend to occur really quickly, around 150\
      \ milliseconds per eye movement during difficult tasks, which is well below\
      \ the level of conscious awareness. We might tell stories about what we were\
      \ doing after the fact, but in the moment, the eyes go where they need to go.\n\
      \nCombining these measurements of perceptual input, through eye tracking, and\
      \ motor output, through motion capture, forms my general approach to scientific\
      \ research. My goal is to create a complete picture of what a human is doing\
      \ in the world while they perform complex actions and use that substantial amount\
      \ of data generated by these machines to provide insights into human behavior.\n\
      \nThis research tends to yield ecologically valid data\u2014real data from real\
      \ people doing real activities. However, the fidelity is limited; the accuracy\
      \ and precision of information I can provide with these methods is less than\
      \ that of someone in a lab isolating individual neurons and conducting detailed\
      \ reductionist work. In the sociology of sciences, people like me who conduct\
      \ broad-scope research often work alongside those who are focused on careful\
      \ reduction. Ideally, both approaches collaboratively tell more complete stories\
      \ and present satisfying narratives about human behavior to new generations\
      \ of students every couple of years.\n\nOkay, I hope I covered everything. Are\
      \ there any questions? Neuroscience nailed it? Great! Actually, that\u2019s\
      \ it. We do have about three more minutes. Does anyone have questions, emotional\
      \ outbursts, existential crises, or things I wish I had said more about? No\
      \ one seems to be speaking up at this moment, so I appreciate that. \n\nOh,\
      \ you liked the phon thing about the 'opsin,' right? Yes, that's the term. Opsin\
      \ reminds me of, well, plants don\u2019t have the motor aspect, but yes, that\u2019\
      s for the biochemistry people. I think opsin is the part that has the most depth;\
      \ it's a class of chemicals that we can study. \n\nOkay, great! Thank you for\

    yeah let&amp;#39;s Okay so let&amp;#39;s do the standard check-in thing so I am
    recording this and we&amp;#39;ll be posting it online um a couple people so people
    have sort of sporadically been contacting me and saying like hey I&amp;#39;m sick
    I&amp;#39;m not going to make it to class hey I&amp;#39;m not going to make the
    deadline that St of stuff if you&amp;#39;re sick straight up don&amp;#39;t come
    to class like we had a whole ass pandemic so like please let us learn that lesson
    as a culture um you don&amp;#39;t need to check with me it&amp;#39;s totally fine
    I trust you uh also the deadlines are all kind of made up so like you know I put
    them on there in the sense of like I really hope everyone has it done by this
    point because I like I use the data from that for each stage um but they&amp;#39;re
    all available until the end of the semester so with the exception of the poster
    thing there&amp;#39;s a couple like hard deadlines for that that like you know
    you have to get it to the printer on time and stuff like that um everything else
    just kind of like just get it done as soon as you can which I understand is a
    dangerous thing to say to some people but um I I trust you I believe in you just
    check all the boxes before the end of the semester we&amp;#39;ll be good to go
    um so quick check in on schedules and stuff what did we do last Wednesday can
    you remind me did I talk or did the group thing group thing yeah group thing group
    thing was good group thing uh uh with bot yeah great uh and then we had something
    that was due and today today what fun we&amp;#39;re going to be talking about
    a lecture that I&amp;#39;ve given like a bunch of times and I always enjoy giving
    it and it&amp;#39;s going to be intro to measurement and the concepts and what
    kns there to pertaining um and check this out look what you get to do when you&amp;#39;re
    in charge no assignment great feel like we&amp;#39;ve been doing we&amp;#39;ve
    been doing enough you guys are doing great um okay uh is this the right day this
    is the right day cool um oh so so today&amp;#39;s lecture is going to be about
    like measurement units and things like that sort of like hopefully more it&amp;#39;s
    got a lot of props and visual aids and whatnot um and I want to do it now because
    on Wednesday I think we can do a free moap inclass recording uh which will be
    our first relationship with like sort of more classical data like I I keep referring
    to like this the text stuff that you&amp;#39;re punching into the server as data
    and it is Data um but it&amp;#39;s kind of like you know if you asked me three
    years ago if that was Data I&amp;#39;d be like yeah I guess technically but it&amp;#39;s
    only since like AI came online that I think of that as data um uh freeo cap is
    a motion capture sort of you know free open source thing that I&amp;#39;ve been
    building for the past half decade or so of My Life um and it&amp;#39;s specifically
    designed to sort of like make good class demos and things like that so we&amp;#39;re
    going to be recording some dat and then talking about it in the Contex of the
    kind of Concepts we&amp;#39;re going to go over today um so hopefully we can get
    some of that in today um let&amp;#39;s see anything else to catch up on um just
    for completeness I will remind everybody although I didn&amp;#39;t nothing special
    has happened with this this round but the server so in in the server in the links
    and resources find the server scrape checkpoint and and there is the same sort
    of at the bottom 127 so that&amp;#39;s the server scraped and analyzed as of this
    morning um so same thing download it unzip it if you don&amp;#39;t know what unzipping
    is it&amp;#39;s the thing where you double click in and it makes a folder next
    door um that you can open like a regular thing um so you can search for your name
    in there I&amp;#39;m going to be refactoring the way that we do the student profile
    building thing so like your individual profiles are going to change probably next
    week um just because I&amp;#39;m going to change theof the code and prompts that
    make it um I realized that it would probably give you a much more precise measurement
    of who what you&amp;#39;re interested in if I didn&amp;#39;t use everything you
    put in the server for the profile but just use the assignment chats so the ones
    from your intro and the poster presentation thing um and I&amp;#39;m also you
    know in the process I might also set something up that you can sort of in a given
    chat you can like ask the bot to remember you and it will pull that history into
    the conversation and that will sort of you don&amp;#39;t have to start every conversation
    from scratch type of thing um uh yeah also by just by way of reminding um sort
    of the word helping you guys learn the paths and whatnot um here we are on the
    server same channel up here links and resources and course Repository click on
    that and something pops up I don&amp;#39;t know why two things pop up um this
    is the course repository this is the sort of the most up to-date oh actually I
    forgot to do this last time update syllabus syllabus commit in sync yes thank
    you don&amp;#39;t break and now up here where go all right same thing on fireof
    Fox and you see it says update syllabus that was the thing I just pushed up and
    now the code is not the code the text is uh which is you know code that code for
    primates um and that&amp;#39;s updated this is called a this is GitHub that&amp;#39;s
    kind of what GitHub does it&amp;#39;s a Version Control software it&amp;#39;s
    kind of like track changes but um more sophisticated um pretty much every piece
    of software you&amp;#39;ve ever used in your life has used git at some level um
    and I&amp;#39;m kind of like hijacking it to do text based stuff um so yeah and
    also just to be clear just for fun um so this site is basically as if it was a
    folder the read me here is the thing that&amp;#39;s posted down there uh this
    is what it looks like formatted that&amp;#39;s what it looks like raw this is
    a honest measurement and record of exactly what my primate body did to a keyboard
    at some point in time so it is a truth preserving record of my thoughts in a way
    that a docx file or a Google Drive Link sort of will never be so shout out to
    markdown in raw text formats okay right so on this page go back to the front page
    hey uh there we go in the lectures folder in 20 25127 intro to measurement and
    the top one is called intro to measurement and here we go it&amp;#39;s the what&amp;#39;s
    it called the notes for my notes for the lecture that we&amp;#39;re about to give
    and with that I&amp;#39;m going to switch away from the GitHub and go to my local
    version just because I want to uh local meaning on this machine not on the internet
    some other servers machine GitHub is own by Microsoft so technically that state
    data is hosted on Microsoft um this is on my computer okay cool this is a brief
    summary we&amp;#39;ll see how much we get through I think we&amp;#39;ll get through
    all of it so here we are in this class extensively to teach y&amp;#39;all what
    science is what science looks like how you might ever do such a wacky thing as
    to attempt to know the world and do Empirical research within it um and there&amp;#39;s
    a lot of things that get taken for granted by when you sort of just live as a
    human person in a world um that you start to find yourself needing to get much
    more specific about once you actually start to trying start trying to get into
    the business of knowledge generation so the idea as a scientist is that you are
    attempting to create new knowledge for humankind um which is a very difficult
    thing to do it&amp;#39;s hard to know stuff um and there&amp;#39;s certain rules
    for how to do that um so a lot of what we talk about in The Sciences the empirical
    Sciences is based on the concept of empirical measurement so um there are many
    ways to know things um the scientific method and empirical method is one way to
    know the world it&amp;#39;s a very powerful way to know the world because it allows
    you to do things like make predictions about the future build tools uh heal people
    when they&amp;#39;re sick things like that um and everything is sort of in that
    sort of conception of knowledge is is based on at some level an empirical measurement
    uh of the world where yeah empirical measurement is we&amp;#39;re going to talk
    a little about what that means but BAS basically it&amp;#39;s the idea that you
    have done yeah you&amp;#39;ve done some kind of a measurement and that&amp;#39;s
    what that term measurement is one of those kind of like one of those terms that
    gets taken for granted but we&amp;#39;ll talk a little bit about what that means
    um so the most important thing to sort of I don&amp;#39;t about the most but one
    of the most one of the very important things to think about when you&amp;#39;re
    thinking about Empirical research and the concept of measurement is that everything
    that you&amp;#39;re doing everything that you&amp;#39;re building on has to be
    built relative to something else so when you&amp;#39;re trying to if you&amp;#39;re
    trying like if you&amp;#39;re uh trying to generate new knowledge that knowledge
    that is going to be sort of based on other things like I used the term earlier
    of Truth preserving a very important term in sort of philosophy of science um
    because that is the concept of being able to build from one thing that you know
    another thing that you might know and everything that you think you know about
    the world if you sort of dig into it is going to be based off some sort of background
    of well I think this because I think because I learn that because I believe this
    because of all that kind of stuff um so it&amp;#39;s helpful when you&amp;#39;re
    sort of trying to learn the concepts of measurement to try to recreate those epistemological
    chains where epistemology is the study of knowledge um and try to ask yourself
    sort of where these things connect to um if I were to redo this which I will some
    time I probably would have put this one up top so where the most important thing
    is that skepticism is the basis of scientific reality which is the other concept
    where skepticism is the idea long story short of you have to you have to have
    reasons to believe the things that you believe um you&amp;#39;re not allowed to
    just believe things for no reason um and everything that you sort of that you
    consider has to be kind of you know you have to look directly at it and try to
    boil down sort of what that is connected to um so given that it is reasonable
    to ask about Origins um and the sort of philosophical the the classical philosophical
    Bedrock of belief uh we tend to ascribe to this dude de cart who was operating
    in like the 1500s you&amp;#39;ve heard of his cartisian coordinates and other
    various things which we&amp;#39;ll talk about in various points in time um but
    he has quot is sort of trying to do this philosophical game of trying to understand
    what his knowledge of the world is based off of and came across this wonderful
    little phrase called kogito Eros which means I think therefore I am which is basically
    a fancy way of saying that if you really drill down to it the only thing that
    you can actually truly know and believe without reference to some other sort of
    piece of knowledge is that you are having a conscious experience right now in
    this very moment you are having a qualitative State you are thinking and be and
    nothing in the concept of the universe could ever fake the experience of having
    a conscious experience in this exact moment now your memories of what you did
    yesterday that could be fake you could have done Heist hallucinogenics you could
    have had some someone could be poking at your brain that could all be fake your
    perception of the world around you that could be fake I think I think there&amp;#39;s
    a cup out there but I could wearing some sort of crazy VR helmet it could be like
    floating in goop in The Matrix and so all of these other things that we want to
    believe um are all in some way shape and form um subjects of skepticism you you
    could deny you could doubt um that the the veracity of anything else besides that
    Central nugget of I am having a conscious experience right now in this moment
    now if you only want to live with that sort of nihilistic belief you were left
    with a rather un uninteresting philosophical position called solipsism which is
    the belief that you are the only person that exists and everything else around
    you was fake and all other people you see are just Illusions um that is technically
    I believe the only truly defensible philosophical position it&amp;#39;s also not
    useful or helpful or particularly interesting um because we we ALS because if
    you&amp;#39;re willing to accept other gradients of belief and gradients of Truth
    into your life you can start to build what feels like knowledge about the real
    world um as long as you&amp;#39;re willing to have things like you&amp;#39;re
    you&amp;#39;re willing to have things like trust in things like memory and if
    you&amp;#39;re willing to sort of smush together all your memory and then believe
    such thing as statistics you can actually do quite a lot with that because yes
    I can doubt I like I can doubt that there&amp;#39;s a cup in front of me right
    now but if I keep looking and it keeps happening and I keep moving and it has
    the sort of like geometrically reasonable deformations and then I reach out and
    then I have a cup in my hand and then I put it to my mouth and I get liquid at
    a certain point the accumulation of those sensory experiences starts to really
    resemble something like knowledge that I might have about the real world like
    it might it it starts to become increasingly likely that there is in fact something
    resembling a cup in what in somewhere outside of my conscious experience um and
    which is great because that&amp;#39;s what allows us to sort of we we match each
    other in this universe on the basis of our shared memories and statistics and
    luckily that doesn&amp;#39;t really it&amp;#39;s not really that hard to do but
    it is sort of troubling to think too closely about so from the epistemological
    point of view we&amp;#39;re going to base our knowledge on sort of the awareness
    that we exist which is good and then I really hate to say it but the only but
    on the other the other thing we have is memory and statistics not a lot but we
    can work from there um now with that I&amp;#39;m going to shift away from uh that
    sort of philosophical epistemological kind of like floofy exist Central crisis
    philosophy 101 type of space and shift back into the more like rigidly sort of
    imp Al grounded world of direct empirical measurements but we&amp;#39;re going
    to have a similar game to be played there where when we think about something
    like measurement um we still have to base that measurement on something so let&amp;#39;s
    talk about let&amp;#39;s talk about measuring things and let&amp;#39;s start I
    think simply simply enough with a really basic measurement called distance spatial
    distance um this lecture has a lot of uh props and visual aids all made roughly
    speaking out of garbage that I found outside um this is a stick that is kind enough
    to be roughly a meter long um and also can be screwed apart it was actually this
    like the stem of a lamp that I found and I didn&amp;#39;t wind up liking the lamp
    but then I realized that if I pulled it apart then I could stop having to pull
    a meter long broom stick onto campus once oh once a semester so so yeah you need
    to find one that I can see hiking stick could probably do well here okay so this
    is this is a stick this has let&amp;#39;s say such a thing as measurement as a
    as a length so if you wanted to measure things in the world you could use something
    like this let&amp;#39;s pretend that this is one meter long even though it&amp;#39;s
    actually slightly longer than that let&amp;#39;s pretend like it&amp;#39;s a meter
    and we wanted to measure something so let&amp;#39;s see thisle brought colors
    today so we&amp;#39;ll see how that goes for us uh RGB R green we start with black
    I guess so if we&amp;#39;re trying to measure the length of things let&amp;#39;s
    say we&amp;#39;re trying to measure the length of the room or how tall you are
    how tall this thing is whatever um we&amp;#39;re going to want to eventually re
    repres you know write these num so we&amp;#39;re going to have some sort of a
    measurement tool like this or a you know what&amp;#39;s it called tape measure
    something like that and we&amp;#39;re going to make some measurements and then
    we&amp;#39;re going to write them down um but when we write them down we&amp;#39;re
    going to be we&amp;#39;re writing down a number of some kind uh so and let&amp;#39;s
    sort of skip a couple steps to then get to the place where we&amp;#39;ve written
    down a bunch of numbers now we want to represent them sort of to communicate we&amp;#39;ve
    done a scientific study on how long various things are and we want to present
    this research to our conspecifics and colleagues so you have to write them down
    so we have various ways of measuring things like space and time um and we&amp;#39;re
    going to start with space and then we&amp;#39;re going to eventually get to time
    which won&amp;#39;t take which is actually not worry about it um so the first
    thing you might want to in measuring things you have things like Dimensions you
    have one dimensional two dimensional three dimensional High dimensional we&amp;#39;ll
    talk about these things in a second um and in all these cases it&amp;#39;s going
    to start with something resembling An Origin so this is the origin it is the it
    is a zero dimensional object um it contains no real information other than it
    exists right this is an or this is a point that doesn&amp;#39;t exist this is
    a point that does exists so this point conveys the information hello yes I exist
    and not really that much else not particularly useful scientifically but very
    important when you&amp;#39;re trying to figure out if I come to you and I say
    oh hey that thing is three and a half sticks long that is implicitly relative
    to something which is zero sticks long which is something that doesn&amp;#39;t
    which has no extent so Zero Dimensional gr great good job so now let&amp;#39;s
    think about this Dimension and let&amp;#39;s call it X because that&amp;#39;s
    traditionally how we do it and this is now a one dimensional object so let&amp;#39;s
    say this is infinitely long and we&amp;#39;ve measured this is one stick long
    so this stick is there so there you go so one one one stick long and then I can
    measure two sticks three sticks Etc that&amp;#39;s way better so now if I&amp;#39;m
    going around measuring things I can keep track of the length of the thing but
    again this is not particularly exciting this is there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s
    not really a point of drawing that you just write down the number you don&amp;#39;t
    gain anything by looking at that number relative to zero other than just the knowledge
    of how numbers work so so that&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re going to call that X we&amp;#39;re
    also going to call that length great so now we want to measure such so and that&amp;#39;s
    good for measuring things like string or distances from here to your house or
    height of a person but now we want to go around we want to measure different things
    we&amp;#39;re still doing stuff in we&amp;#39;re still measuring length and distances
    and now we&amp;#39;re going to split and have a second dimension that we&amp;#39;ll
    call Y we&amp;#39;ll also call that height and it uses the same unit so you can
    still be one stick tall you can be two sticks tall things like that and so now
    you can measure things like boards and desks and floors and if you measure something
    in it&amp;#39;s two units long and then one unit tall then that&amp;#39;s a point
    in that space and that is a two-dimensional Point two-dimensional meaning it&amp;#39;s
    got two numbers you have to use to define it in the robotics world someday like
    we&amp;#39;re going to I know this is basic we will be ramping up from here um
    but another way to think about this is it&amp;#39;s two degrees of freedom meaning
    that if you want to know the area of something uh you need to know two numbers
    to be able to Define that entirely you need length you need width and you could
    do that in various other ways but this is a two dimensional number um so now you
    want to measure thing you want to keep going so you want to keep measuring something
    in a higher dimensional space so you&amp;#39;ve got length you&amp;#39;ve got
    area area is length times width or something like that and so now you want to
    also measure volume and with that I have run out of dimensions on the board I
    can no longer so this is an accurate one: one representation of the two-dimensional
    Point XY if I want to make a three-dimensional space I no longer have enough dimensions
    on this board because this board is a two-dimensional object so we can fake it
    and do this kind of like right angle thing let&amp;#39;s call this guy back here
    Z and think about how do we do this so we go so one two and then one two three
    so so this is XZ and then we can also pain that up that&amp;#39;s a little screwy
    but it&amp;#39;s fine you get it x y z great this is a three dimensional Point
    we&amp;#39;ve done it that&amp;#39;s great um so this is how you can measure if
    you&amp;#39;re trying to categorize objects according to their volume you need
    three degrees of freedom you need three numbers to Define that volume specifically
    and you can represent that spatially in this nice sort of three-dimensional grid
    here um now I don&amp;#39;t want to belabor this point too much because it will
    we&amp;#39;ll sort of get there but so this is three dimensions traditionally
    if you ever if you&amp;#39;re going to touch engineering this is the international
    symbol for threedimensional space x x y z this is the right hand rule um so doing
    it backwards here but it would be was that yeah it&amp;#39;s like this so XY Z
    XY z um this is a left-handed coordinate system it is illegal don&amp;#39;t do
    this just because of the rules um actually there&amp;#39;s more to be said there
    but we can SK past it um and so in three dimensions is how many we have in this
    in in space in three dimensional space in humans we are super good at a lot of
    spatial estimates and we really are very good at making things making um very
    quick calculations of things like the cup is is is in front of the bottle the
    cup is near the edge of the table those kind of spatial um what&amp;#39;s the
    word computations are very easy for us now there&amp;#39;s nothing special about
    three dimensions except for that that&amp;#39;s how many you need to define space
    and time but you can keep going with these numbers if you&amp;#39;re trying to
    define something that requires more than three numbers to Define um and again
    I don&amp;#39;t want to blab this point too much but I I will say that it has
    to do with Pythagorean theorem and like how you measure things like distance um
    because in one dimension the distance from a point to the to the origin is trivially
    sort of two so pyan is the one that&amp;#39;s a b c so a 2 + b^2 = C2 so c equal
    &amp;lt; TK of a + b a s plus bqu whatever so this is how you do distance you&amp;#39;ve
    all seen this I&amp;#39;m sure at various points in your high school career um
    this is the the particular case of doing Pythagorean theorem for two Dimensions
    you replace the A and B with X and Y and then you have a way to measure distance
    in a two- dimensional space in a one-dimensional space it&amp;#39;s very you know
    the square root of 2 to the 2 is just two so that&amp;#39;s easy to do um in two-dimensional
    space it&amp;#39;s just that in three-dimensional space to measure distance you
    just add a z you just do the measure the distance in in 3D space is the square
    root of x^2 + y^2 plus z^2 and then you can just keep going you just there&amp;#39;s
    nothing special about two you can add a w you can add a l you can add a I don&amp;#39;t
    know M and just keep going and keep and you you lose the ability to plot it in
    a way that makes sense but you can keep doing all the same math that you were
    doing with three dimensions up to te million dimensions and a lot of the AI stuff
    the way that that works is it is it uses that same kind of like spatial math but
    it&amp;#39;s doing it in like very very high dimensional spaces which is one of
    those terms that you keep you hear people say things like high dimensional mathematics
    and it&amp;#39;s like oh my God it&amp;#39;s so crazy it just means that you keep
    adding numbers to the Pythagorean theorem to measure distance and everything else
    is pretty much the same um I will say too there&amp;#39;s a lot of we&amp;#39;re
    going to do like General like mathy stuff here um but luckily you don&amp;#39;t
    have to do any of the math you just have to understand it which is so much easier
    like because I know that there&amp;#39;s a part where I&amp;#39;m sort of I say
    oh look you can have two x y things like that and that like makes some intuitive
    sense um and I just need to promise you that that intuitive gut check of like
    yeah that makes rough sense that&amp;#39;s the vast vast vast majority of the
    things that you actually need to know about mathematics like being able to do
    it on paper helps um the guy who touchs the class before this I&amp;#39;m sure
    would have many things to say about what I&amp;#39;m about to say but I firmly
    believe that being able to do the math on paper is just it&amp;#39;s an extra
    layer of understanding on top of the gut check intuitions that will get you most
    of the way towards where you need to go um okay yeah so right now we&amp;#39;re
    talking about let&amp;#39;s make this simpler and just go back down to two Dimensions
    because it&amp;#39;s easier there we go 2D great um so this is we call these cartisian
    coordinates because ofart because Western science and math likes to name things
    after the people that discover them which is annoying as hell because the same
    people discover so many things that you end up replac using all these words all
    over again it&amp;#39;s really obnoxious um but these are called cartisian coordinates
    ostensibly named for C deart who the story is that he was he was like a sickly
    guy and he was like in his bed and was watching a fly crawling on a window and
    realized that he could Define the the fly&amp;#39;s position by just looking at
    the intersection point between the fly and these two points on the window sill
    and then thus made some formalisms and then get to name a whole you get to name
    the concepts of a grid after this guy which is annoying but so this cartisian
    space is typically defined by things like it&amp;#39;s got straight lines it&amp;#39;s
    got grids it&amp;#39;s got squares if you go you you know go from two Dimension
    to three dimension you go from a square to a cube things like that you could also
    Define this type of stuff in angular coordinates so I&amp;#39;m if I care about
    this point in space I could Define it using these sort of like straight line you
    know right right angle projections onto these basis Vector axes I could also say
    that it&amp;#39;s you know this far away at that angle off of zero so I start
    by I I start from this sort of you know we&amp;#39;ll call they call it X and
    then we go up by this angle which can be degrees or radians or whatever you want
    then we go out by this number R by some distance and we still get to the same
    spot in 2D space and so in and so instead of defining this in terms of XY I could
    also Define it in terms of theta row which row is just like the distance row like
    radius like if this was a circle it would be whatever that&amp;#39;s not actually
    what row means but that&amp;#39;s fine and so again noticing that this is a two-dimensional
    point two degrees of freedom and I can Define it either in these linear XY coordinates
    or I can Define it in these angular Theta row coordinates um because yeah you
    need two numbers to Define its position and so two numbers you get uh once you
    start if you were to go from so this is a good way to draw circles if you go from
    2D to 3D they become spheres and the important thing to know is that you can always
    switch back and forth between the linear coordinate systems or the spherical coordinate
    systems the sort of we call these polar coordinates versus cartisian coordinates
    and in practice when you&amp;#39;re doing stuff you wind up just switching back
    and forth depending on what you&amp;#39;re doing in the math like you know if
    I&amp;#39;m looking at things like joint angles it&amp;#39;s really helpful to
    look at it in terms of polar coordinates because there&amp;#39;s already got angles
    in it in fact it&amp;#39;s even easier than that because we looking at one of
    these guys this distance we can just assume never changes so now if I&amp;#39;m
    looking at something like joint angles if I assume that these are rigid bodies
    and and the and the r doesn&amp;#39;t change then now I only need one number to
    Define where it is and not two so now I have like one less number to deal with
    which is great because we have too many numbers already that doesn&amp;#39;t make
    sense it might tomorrow um let&amp;#39;s see I&amp;#39;m going to skip some of
    this because it gets too we&amp;#39;re getting pretty mathy pretty quick and this
    is going to I think make more sense um once there&amp;#39;s data to look at um
    but the other thing I guess I&amp;#39;ll say just by way of completeness um we&amp;#39;ve
    we&amp;#39;ve been talking about ways of measuring space um and we also should
    talk about ways of measuring time you&amp;#39;ll hear you hear terms like spatio
    temporal coordinates spatio temporal calibration whatnot remember that&amp;#39;s
    an O term so spatio temporal is just spatial SLT temporal it just means you&amp;#39;re
    thinking about both space and time and when you&amp;#39;re looking at data like
    this it&amp;#39;s very common to see in 2D plots want to keep that I don&amp;#39;t
    think I need to keep that you see it&amp;#39;s really common to see stuff presented
    like this where this this x axis is time and then the y axis is some measurement
    over time so if we&amp;#39;re thinking that Y is going to be let&amp;#39;s say
    it&amp;#39;s height of my hand off the ground and then at Time Zero we&amp;#39;re
    going to measure it and it&amp;#39;s one so there we go time zero that&amp;#39;s
    me at one and then we&amp;#39;re going to wait let&amp;#39;s say a second and
    then we&amp;#39;re going to measure it let&amp;#39;s say it&amp;#39;s now one
    and a half units off the ground I have time one doing there if I keep moving up
    it&amp;#39;s going to keep going up and if I wind up doing this with my hand then
    you&amp;#39;re going to see dots doing like that and then if you connect all those
    dots and you&amp;#39;ll start seeing things like squiggles and this is called
    a Time series because it&amp;#39;s a series of measurements over time so this
    is a one-dimensional measurement so I&amp;#39;m just getting height and I&amp;#39;m
    measuring it once per time unit which could be seconds it could be if it&amp;#39;s
    a video like this then it&amp;#39;s going to be 30 frames per second so it&amp;#39;s
    once every 33 milliseconds you know if it&amp;#39;s a microphone that records
    at 44 ktz then it&amp;#39;s once every one over 44,000 44,000 over one or one
    over 44,000 seconds um but and that&amp;#39;s how you get measurements over time
    and the important thing to see is you&amp;#39;ll often see this presented as connect
    as a straight as a connected line but that&amp;#39;s not actually what you&amp;#39;re
    measuring um you&amp;#39;re only ever going to be measuring something at time
    intervals you&amp;#39;re going to be getting one measurement per time interval
    and so you and so this is what your data actually looks like um so if we we have
    to assume that the movement between the measured interval is kind of like cerent
    like what we expect it to be and if we do that then we can connect the lines and
    get a nice time series but if this is one measurement every second and I&amp;#39;m
    doing this with my hand then it actually doesn&amp;#39;t look like that under
    the hood if this if these intervals is like one every you know millisecond then
    we can trust that if it&amp;#39;s one every second I could just as easily be doing
    this with my hand and we only get these measurements every second so if we interpolate
    going to be missing a lot of the story um yeah so that&amp;#39;s time um and I&amp;#39;ll
    just say it just because it&amp;#39;s on the thing uh similar to space time can
    also be thought of in in two basic forms linear time sort of like a stopwatch
    and phasic time which is like a clock where it resets to zero every every Circle
    through the available values that will become important in the future um blah
    blah blah if you care about calculus the you know if this is the position the
    slope is the velocity because it&amp;#39;s the change in position over time if
    you do that again you get acceleration so velocity is the derivative of position
    acceleration is the derivative of velocity then you go back with the integrals
    that&amp;#39;s all the calc you ever need to know as far as I care um okay so
    yeah so that&amp;#39;s measurement right and we&amp;#39;ve been we&amp;#39;ve
    been talking about these measurement in terms of kind of these like abstract units
    so you know singular sticks whatever doesn&amp;#39;t really it doesn&amp;#39;t
    matter like in the same sort of methods of plotting will work no matter what it
    is that you&amp;#39;re no matter what units you&amp;#39;re looking at measuring
    distance we might use meters if we measuring temperature we might use Celsius
    or kelvin if you&amp;#39;re measuring weight you might use kilograms um and the
    same sort of plotting representations will sort of work throughout uh now this
    is a practical thing that you should keep in mind and will come up at some point
    in your future um but when we&amp;#39;re talking about the Sciences there&amp;#39;s
    rules about the units that we&amp;#39;re allowed to use um we&amp;#39;re here
    in a America where we have things like imperial units for like you know feet and
    inches and stuff like that um which are often kind of people talk about them as
    like these are Bonkers worthless measurements and they kind of there&amp;#39;s
    a good argument for that but uh the reality is that a lot of our Imperial the
    Imperial measurements that we tend to use are based on very factorable numbers
    like 12 and 16 because it is easier to do that kind of math in like a home environment
    um whereas metric is B off of T which is very good for things like decimal points
    and precision but kind of harder to cut into even so 10 you only get to cut into
    two and five whereas 12 you get two and five before you start needing things like
    fractions uh 12 you have one two three four six and 12 um so if you&amp;#39;re
    imagining that you&amp;#39;re like a vendor in some medieval town and you have
    like a bunch of Weights that you have to bring to measure out your stuff it&amp;#39;s
    easier to have stuff weighed in terms of 16s and 12 like things like baking and
    stuff like that is easy because it&amp;#39;s really easy to cut things in half
    and by Third and stuff like that um but in the Sciences we are required by law
    to use SI units uh by law I mean convention um SI units stands for standard international
    it&amp;#39;s a French term that means International standard um and there are
    a set number of of them so here is the Wikipedia page and these are all of the
    base SI units for time we have seconds for meters we have for length we have meters
    for Mass we have kilograms for electrical currents we have ampers for thermodynamic
    temperature we have Kelvin uh for amount of substance we have mole and for luminous
    intensity we have Candela um for the most part around here we&amp;#39;re going
    to be mostly thinking about these ones so C second met kilog uh now this is one
    of the now we get to the first visual eight uh now one of the cool things about
    the metric system is that a lot of the parts match up so this is if this was one
    meter which it&amp;#39;s not but it let&amp;#39;s pretend that it was if this
    was one meter and this was one liter which it claims to be um this is everything
    we would need to recreate the majority of the metric system so the way that it&amp;#39;s
    defin a a liter is a th000 milliliters a milliliter is a cubic ctim of water and
    a cubic centimeter of water weighs one gram so if you have a centimeter and you
    got get a make a cube of that of that shape and put water in that Cube and measure
    the the weight of it um that is defined as I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s
    defined as but it&amp;#39;s uh that cubic centimeter of water weighs one gram
    if you were then get a thousand of those things together it would weigh one kilogram
    and a thousand of those centimeters cubic centimeters of water ccs would equal
    one liter and one liter uh weighs 1 kilogram so you get it&amp;#39;s kind of this
    fun sort of Correspondence there where you get a lot of the if you know what how
    long a meter is and you have standardized water um you can recreate a lot of the
    units that we we wind up using here um yeah yeah and then the meter stick it turns
    out traditionally it was measured as this this stick in France it used to be there
    used to be like an actual stick like this um but I guess it it&amp;#39;s like
    rusted away over time so now it just represents some markings on a stone we have
    since moved away from this method of determining a meter and now use it as we
    measure it in terms of the like the distance that light travels so I can&amp;#39;t
    remember exactly how we used to do c seconds um but it was something to do with
    like the period perod of a pendulum of a given length um and we we sense we now
    we now measure seconds in terms of the oscillation of a cesium atom because it&amp;#39;s
    a some sort of quantum thing it&amp;#39;s they oscillate at at a very regular
    interval and then we measure meters by the distance that light travels in so many
    oscillations of a cesium atom and that measurement was basically designed as the
    the time it takes for light to travel this distance um so that we could be more
    precise with our more modern uh measurements and whatnot um yeah and then these
    yeah so so these are the only base units that we have to do proper science so
    if you&amp;#39;re ever doing a scientific study or measurement or you have to
    report numbers you&amp;#39;re not allowed to use inches you have to use meters
    you can you can choose to use things like centimeters or millimeters or kilometers
    or whatever unit whatever number of zeros Mak sense for your measurement but you&amp;#39;re
    not allowed to use inches or feet or and if you&amp;#39;re measuring mass you&amp;#39;re
    not allowed to use pounds you have to use kilograms uh and if you are when I say
    allowed I mean like the scientific Community has Creed so like if you&amp;#39;re
    publishing a paper in a scientific journal um they should if you were if you present
    stuff with your numbers and things like feet and pounds they should send it back
    to you and say convert these to SI units and send it back and if they don&amp;#39;t
    then I would consider that to be a failure of the peer review process which is
    its own conversation there um now a thing to notice about this rather rather tur
    list of possible units is why is just asking yourself like why is it so constrained
    why are these the numbers that we have um and the answer is it it it if you sort
    of drill down into it like these are what we consider to be like the short list
    of measurable things everything that we can measure with our basic sort of tools
    um can boil down to either these basic quantities or derive more complicated combinations
    of these con of these quantities so you have time you have spatial extent you
    have mass you have we have electrical current Kelvin temperature is just uh Kelvin
    is just celus where zero is at Absolute Zero um mole is some countable amount
    and then Candela is light um so ear when we were talking about like transduction
    and things like that um in terms of environmental energies and things that the
    nervous system wants to take in in order for us to perceive something about the
    world this is sort of a roundabout way of thinking about like if you&amp;#39;re
    measure if you&amp;#39;re thinking about a sensory system and you&amp;#39;re thinking
    about the energy that it absorbs to give you a empirical estimate about what&amp;#39;s
    in the world you can think about how that you know how does sight how does sound
    how does touch how does taste boil down to these basic units you will also quickly
    discover that if you&amp;#39;re trying to do anything of Interest you&amp;#39;re
    going to these are not really going to cut it for you uh for very long because
    there&amp;#39;s just not much yeah you&amp;#39;re going to have to eventually
    come up with new units to measure more interesting things um for example if you
    want to measure something like velocity you want to measure how fast something
    is moving through the world you can&amp;#39;t do it with these alone but you can
    do it by starting to squish some of them together so with velocity we can measure
    that in terms of meters second by look which is the units are just met per second
    is the same as meters divided by second so every time there is a second every
    time a second passes you move this many meters that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s your
    velocity and so the the SI units for velocity are meters per second unless you&amp;#39;re
    going very slow in which case you might use millimeters per second or if you&amp;#39;re
    going very fast you might want to use kilometers per second but it&amp;#39;s still
    going to boil down to these SI units there um and this is where it&amp;#39;s going
    to start getting towards Neuroscience this is we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re rapidly
    approaching the topic of this course which I probably should have sort of specified
    beforehand um so one of the main sort of Nod nodules in the in that interest space
    of that of the class is biomechanics sort of you a lot of yall asked about biomechanics
    like what does that mean and you know whatever whatever conversations you had
    with the biomechanics is roughly speaking good oldfashioned Newtonian physics
    except as it applies to a wobbly biological system typically one that has something
    like a mus like a muscular skeletal system um and we will soon be sort of getting
    to the biomechanics and and next week the data that we&amp;#39;re going to be
    collecting in class is going to involve things like the it&amp;#39;s going to
    involve standing balance so things like like look at this wacky thing that I&amp;#39;m
    doing with my body I&amp;#39;m carrying the majority of my mass some 100 kilograms
    of salty meat like a meter and a half above the ground which is a really insane
    thing to do and I can hold I can even go onto one foot and now that&amp;#39;s
    this is a lot of mass being supported on a couple of Wiggly joints some variable
    stiffness electric strings called muscles and a base of support that&amp;#39;s
    like this big if I ever come in if I came in here with like 200 kg of Steel and
    I put it on something that was that small and raise it Up This Tall that would
    be a very dangerous thing to do but it&amp;#39;s something that we do with our
    bodies a healthy person will do it a million times per year so if you uh 10,000
    steps a day let say 20,000 steps a day because you&amp;#39;re grads you talk you
    walk a lot uh 20,000 time 365 is approaching a million steps per day and so that
    is a period of time where your the big mass of your body is being supported above
    the ground because your nervous system is electrifying and firing your muscles
    in the right way at the appropriate intervals to keep you from falling over and
    so this is one of those things that we just we don&amp;#39;t really think about
    it but once you start thinking about it there&amp;#39;s a lot going on there and
    my particular approach to studying this stuff involves kind of like boiling it
    down to those first principles measuring the behavior in those basic units of
    geometry and physics and then trying to figure out what we can infer about the
    UN the unmeasurable parts of that system which is like the neural firings based
    off of the physics and geometry of the measurable components which is like where
    is my body at any given point in space so this type of thing yeah and so when
    we talk about things like biomechanics we&amp;#39;re talking about like the physics
    of of bi physics as applied to organisms in biology um the units we&amp;#39;re
    going to start talking about are in terms of you know position where am I in space
    velocity how am I moving in space and then we start getting into sort of fancier
    terms like force like what forces am I applying to the world like if I&amp;#39;m
    if I&amp;#39;m standing right here and I push with my toes I will tilt backwards
    um if I&amp;#39;m if I push off the table I&amp;#39;ll go that way so I&amp;#39;m
    applying forces into the world and because I&amp;#39;m I am a massive object putting
    Force into the world that will cause me to move um the units for force are Newtons
    which is kilograms time meters times uh seconds squared uh so that&amp;#39;s kilogram
    m/s squar so if you remember we had acceleration so we had position is in meters
    velocity is in meters per second uh how many what did your position change how
    many meter in in one second how many meters did you change velocity uh sorry acceleration
    is meters per second per second so you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re speeding up uh
    how how much faster did you are you going a second from now versus right now that&amp;#39;s
    acceleration um and then if we sort of jump ahead to sort of Newton&amp;#39;s
    Laws uh Newton&amp;#39;s Laws of Motion you you know Force equals masstimes acceleration
    we&amp;#39;ve all heard that one before um I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;ll leave this
    as an exercise to the reader I guess uh if you sit down and if you do Force equals
    mass times acceleration if you do Mass which is in kilograms time acceleration
    which is meters per second squar you will get this unit and we call that unit
    Newtons um and then if we sort of apply a force over a given distance we have
    something we call work um work is just force applied over distance that gives
    you kilograms time meters squared times second squared and that gives and that
    is a we call that a jewel uh which is a unit of energy energy is the ability to
    do work EG the thing that is conserved and we&amp;#39;re talking about the conservation
    of energy uh so if you other famous equation eal MC s if you do that units out
    you will you will find that energy in that equation is You Know M E equals m c
    s so energy equals mass in kilogram time C which is the speed of light in meters
    per second squared you&amp;#39;ll wind up with one of these things um so just
    a good example of how that stuff boils down to SI units and once you&amp;#39;ve
    gotten to energy we now have now we&amp;#39;re touching this sort of this classic
    physics things of the conservation of energy and this winds up being a very good
    like this is a phys a law of physics that if you&amp;#39;re observing a system
    that&amp;#39;s a closed system energy is neither created nor destroyed it just
    changes form and that&amp;#39;s a really strong belief that that I have that we
    have physics has been very uh physics has been very adamant that conservation
    of energy is generally true and so that winds up being a very strong assumption
    that I can use as a scientist to try to make sense of the wacky data that we&amp;#39;re
    going to be measuring uh when we start actually looking at the weird goopy complexity
    of a person moving through space um that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense it might later
    or it might not we&amp;#39;ll find out as a group uh yeah normalized units too
    we can talk about [Music] um yeah so I won&amp;#39;t say too much about this I&amp;#39;ll
    just say it in passing but uh even though there are things even though like SI
    units you use SI units for things like kill for things like Mass if you&amp;#39;re
    doing something like measuring a person moving through space and you measuring
    like like this is me walking around and this is me like pushing off the ground
    and um second uh you know putting Force into the ground stuff like that um it
    might stop it might like measuring everything in terms of kilogram starts to get
    annoying because it&amp;#39;s like oh I&amp;#39;m 100 kilograms or whatever I&amp;#39;ve
    said I think I said 200 but it&amp;#39;s not not that um uh because we&amp;#39;re
    thinking about the we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re studying a a person so we can make
    our math and our lives much easier by just dividing all of our our Mass measurement
    by my personal body weight like how much my Mass is in kilograms and so then we&amp;#39;re
    no longer using things like kilograms everywhere we&amp;#39;re now talking about
    things like body masses body weights or whatever um weight is actually a measure
    of uh force not mass but um and so we can do we basically so that we would say
    we would normalize mass by the participants by the subject by the person&amp;#39;s
    body mass so now we have a one when looking at our units we get we get the number
    one which is a very convenient unit because you can kind of it makes the math
    sort of work out easier um okay so now we have okay so we&amp;#39;re going to
    now we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re inching our way towards a human
    and we this we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re the conception of human as as one of these
    approximations not one of these this is too complicated let&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re
    going to stick with this um and by getting we&amp;#39;ve gotten through all that
    spatial stuff all that measurement stuff all that unit stuff and now we can start
    thinking in terms of of physics now physics is just it&amp;#39;s the sort of the
    math of the description of how objects move through the world and there&amp;#39;s
    all sorts of different layers of physics and the layer that I tend to hang out
    in is what&amp;#39;s called classical mechanics where classical mechanics is B
    basically Newton&amp;#39;s three laws as they apply to simple sort of mechanical
    objects so it&amp;#39;s basically like Cannonball physics um now this is also
    a fun example of like a a philosophy of science concept which is that our all
    everything all of our theories are wrong at any at all points at all points in
    time um so Newton&amp;#39;s Laws came about in I want to say like 1700s or something
    like that uh and he was trying to understand the motion of the planets um and
    so he came up with these simple rules of sort of how mechanics tends the works
    and it was very useful and it explains a lot of the physical world it explains
    a lot of sort of simple objects in the world and you can derive their trajectories
    through space using Newtonian mechanics it and it explains the majority of the
    planetary motions but it doesn&amp;#39;t do a good job of of predicting the movement
    of a planet like Mercury and it was actually so and if and if and even in that
    day they if they applied the Newtonian predictions for Planet trajectories it
    didn&amp;#39;t the uh Mercury&amp;#39;s orbit didn&amp;#39;t line up with the
    prediction so they actually postulated for a long time that there was a another
    planet between Mercury and Venus that could be making sense of the weird anomalies
    and Mercury&amp;#39;s orbit and that planet was called Vulcan which is where that
    term comes from um eventually time passed and such a guy as Einstein came on the
    picture and sort of started kicking out all these wacky ideas around relativity
    Theory and uh it&amp;#39;s much harder math but if you apply th those that theoretical
    framework to the Motions of the planet and you now account for the fact that the
    that the sun is so massive that it warps SpaceTime and all that kind of wacky
    nonsense now all of a sudden uh Mercury&amp;#39;s orbit starts to make sense and
    you no longer need to posit the existence of some un of some unknown undiscovered
    planet called Vulcan um and so we know from measurements that Newton&amp;#39;s
    Laws of mechanics are not an accurate representation of the physical universe
    that we inhabit we also know that be that in any location that we tend to care
    about as human beings on a planet the accuracy that you get when you use Newton&amp;#39;s
    Laws is like nine de it&amp;#39;s like decimal place like 9 10 decimal places
    out uh so you start like the difference between the prediction of this Ball&amp;#39;s
    Motion in Newtonian mechanics and the same prediction in relativistic mechanics
    is so far below our ability to measure the position it just those numers you only
    relativity when you start looking at things like planets on the scales of you
    know stars and stuff like that so we still use Newtonian Mechanics for almost
    everything that we do in our daily lives even though we know that that is not
    as accurate as something like relativistic physics and there&amp;#39;s a lot to
    be said there but let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s keep movement um so yeah so Newton&amp;#39;s
    Laws there&amp;#39;s three of them a body the first law is a body in rest or in
    motion tends to stay in rest or in motion so that&amp;#39;s inertia things in
    motion tend to stay in motion unless acted upon by a force the second one arguably
    my favorite is force equals mass times acceleration or if you&amp;#39;re in rotational
    space it&amp;#39;s torque equals moment of inertia times angular acceleration
    but don&amp;#39;t worry about that um so fals ma is a very very useful equation
    uh basically so if you look at me I am a mass uh my Mass is not changing so let&amp;#39;s
    just Let&amp;#39;s ignore the M of that because it&amp;#39;s not doing anything
    it&amp;#39;s a constant so let&amp;#39;s divide by my body weight and then we
    have Force equals acceleration so I&amp;#39;m not moving I&amp;#39;m not accelerating
    that means that the sum of forces acting on my body has to equals z if it if it
    if it didn&amp;#39;t I would be moving now I&amp;#39;m going to I&amp;#39;m going
    to so all the pluses and the minus have to add up to zero in order for that to
    to work um and you can see if I I like soften my oh let me do this backwards the
    third the third law is for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
    you have an action and a reaction force so here I am standing look we&amp;#39;re
    officially doing Neuroscience that&amp;#39;s me I&amp;#39;m standing and I&amp;#39;m
    standing on the ground and I weigh one body mass and I am being pulled down by
    this horrible Planet at a rate of G if you drop me from a c from a place up high
    I would accelerate downward at 9.8 meters per second squared let&amp;#39;s call
    it 10 uh and and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s always happening at all times um
    but so this Force so so G is 9.8 m/s squared uh so that&amp;#39;s the A and the
    f equals Ma and I&amp;#39;m move and I&amp;#39;m so I&amp;#39;m being pulled down
    by that amount but I&amp;#39;m not moving so the so there must be something else
    pushing back with exactly the same force and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s our
    good friend the ground the ground is a very useful object it allows us to complete
    most of our goals and as I am pushing this is the action I am pushing into the
    ground with mass times Gravity Force and the ground is dutifully pushing back
    with exactly negative masstimes Gravity Force great if I ever decide to break
    this equation I can push if I like if I decide to push off the ground with more
    than that than than more than gravity is pulling me then I can do such a wacky
    thing is jump so I put Force into the ground it&amp;#39;s more than I weigh I
    briefly airborne and then gravity pulls me back down um and that winds up being
    important for a lot of stuff okay I need to speed up here um okay okay I think
    I know how this is going to go so great so this is our this is your uh preview
    of high level human movement Neuroscience um but we gotta we got to do a little
    more work before we can get into the the meat there let&amp;#39;s go back to thinking
    about simple simple spheroids um such as brightly colored juggling balls um so
    yeah so when you&amp;#39;re doing empirical studies you&amp;#39;re doing empirical
    measurements you always have to make assumptions that&amp;#39;s always going to
    be a thing that you&amp;#39;re doing you have to make assumptions that your senses
    aren&amp;#39;t lying to you at all times you make assumptions that when you read
    papers that the people who did that study are not actively lying to you and falsifying
    all their data um you have to make assumptions about yeah and every time you make
    an assumption you get a little bit more predictive power um so if I if I&amp;#39;m
    trying to measure my body moving through space I know that this is like a wobbly
    meaty thing and I know that the distance between my elbow and my wrist changes
    ever so slightly because I am made of squishy meat but if I just assume that I&amp;#39;m
    that that that&amp;#39;s just not happening and that I&amp;#39;m actually composed
    of rigid bodies that don&amp;#39;t change length then I get a lot I get a lot
    my math gets easier because now I don&amp;#39;t have to measure the length between
    these things I only have to meure the angles between them um and so those assumptions
    that we make and wind the only the only measurement you can make without making
    assumptions is that you are having a conscious experience at this exact moment
    and that&amp;#39;s just not very useful um so this is where we come back to what
    I was talking about earlier where this the idea of a conservation of energy winds
    up being one of those very very powerful and very very useful assumptions that
    can really get us a lot of the way towards understanding the things that we care
    about the desiderata of our research goals the things that is desired in our research
    activity um because again looking at this object there&amp;#39;s a lot like if
    if my desire is to understand something like standing posture or God forbid Locomotion
    uh there&amp;#39;s a lot there there there are many many aspects of that question
    that I cannot measure empirically I just don&amp;#39;t have the technological
    capacity to measure the firing in my cerebellum or the stretch forces in my muscles
    I can&amp;#39;t measure that but I can measure things like the sort of the stick
    figure position of my body 33 times per second using something like a motion capture
    system that I built over time in my house um and so by using that thing that I
    can measure in these certain assumptions about conservation of energy I can start
    to have I can start to try to understand like the the what we&amp;#39;ll just
    call the technical term it&amp;#39;s the fidly bits um and this is going to fuz
    out I think in a bit uh that we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll sort of like we&amp;#39;ll
    pick up I get probably around here next week um but I&amp;#39;m going to get through
    it all so that at least it&amp;#39;s at least you will have experienced it at
    least one time um so when you&amp;#39;re thinking about when you&amp;#39;re doing
    sort of a mechanical analysis of a person um you can you want to think about what
    are the forms of energy that are relevant to this task that I&amp;#39;m looking
    at here um and in this part of the class we&amp;#39;re just measuring movement
    the motor control part we&amp;#39;re not looking at perception we&amp;#39;re not
    looking at Vision so we get to ignore things like light and we get to focus on
    just the simple physics of being a massive object in a world that has such things
    as ground and gravity and so the forms of energy that we can really measure and
    we can really care about are mostly potential energy and kinetic energy and there&amp;#39;s
    a lot of forms of potential energy um the most obvious and easy one is gravitational
    potential energy which is the distance so this is the ground we&amp;#39;ll call
    that the height is zero you got to do that doesn&amp;#39;t matter where we are
    horizontally but it does matter where we are vertically and so po potential energy
    gravitation potential energy equals mass gravity height so which again mass is
    kilogram meters per second squared height is again in meters you can do the math
    and figure out that this the units will be Newtons when you do that and so the
    potential energy is basically a measurement of if I had this object and I dropped
    it the force that it would that if I put like a scale underneath that the force
    that it would put into that scale is this many newtons um yeah other forms of
    potential energy which we&amp;#39;re not really going to talk as much about are
    things like spring potential energy so if like stretchiness of a spring also chemical
    potential energy which is like food and bombs and gasoline and stuff like that
    a lot of the sort of the deeper level biology you&amp;#39;re going to start getting
    into chemical potential energy and that&amp;#39;s when you start things seeing
    things like the ion charges don&amp;#39;t line up so there&amp;#39;s ex that&amp;#39;s
    you start measuring into the colums or whatever that electrical unit is so that&amp;#39;s
    the potential energy is like a mismatch between the way that the world would really
    prefer to be and the way that the world currently is so the low energy state if
    I wasn&amp;#39;t holding this the low energy state of the world would be this
    on the ground and so if I let go then I know how much energy is going to be hit
    there da da d da um the other one to think about is kinetic energy which is the
    physics of M M so if you were to measure yeah so kinetic energy is half kinetic
    energy 12 met MV squ 1 12 MV squ at mass is kilograms velocity is meters per second
    do the math I promise you it will turn out to be Newtons because it&amp;#39;s
    a measure of force and it is the amount of force that would be hit like if I were
    to drop this the instantaneous moment before it hits the ground it would be having
    the an how it would have a certain amount of kinetic energy how much kinetic energy
    would it have it would have exactly the same amount of kinetic energy as it had
    potential energy before I dropped it and if you add these things together oh no
    not do that and yeah and so using that type of analysis potential and kinetic
    energy is where you get things like the parabolic Flight of the object through
    space because as it leaves my hand it has the instantaneous moment that it breaks
    contact with my hand and it&amp;#39;s in Free Flight it has a certain amount of
    kinetic energy and it has the most energy that it&amp;#39;s going to have for
    this entire trajectory uh has maximum kinetic energy minimum potential energy
    and it goes up through space the kinetic energy it slows down as it goes up and
    it gets higher so the potential energy increases until it reaches a point where
    it&amp;#39;s at the Apex and the potential energy is now at the max because it&amp;#39;s
    as high as it&amp;#39;s going to get the kinetic energy is at the minimum because
    it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s briefly uh it briely has zero velocity when it goes
    from moving up to moving down um and then it&amp;#39;s going to come back the
    other way and when it hits when it gets right the moment right the moment right
    over hit the ground hits my hand again it will have the same amount of kinetic
    energy as it had when it started so you get this nice sort of trade-off there
    so this is a much so when I talked about things like transduction for for vision
    or for action or for somata sensation or things like that we&amp;#39;re talking
    about a transfer of energy from one form for light let&amp;#39;s say Candelas
    into another form which is a pattern of neural activity measured by voltages and
    electron ion mismatches and stuff like that um there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s
    so much that&amp;#39;s not measurable in that conversion um but physics would
    have us believe that if you could tally up every ion and every sort of quantum
    of of energy the math of that conversion would match would would work out as perfectly
    as The Cannonball physics of simple ballistic motion does um because this transition
    from kinetic potential energy is also transduction that is also a transfer of
    energy from one form to another um yeah uh we&amp;#39;re ignoring if I was a bird
    I could flap my wings and push against air sufficiently to get a reaction force
    to sort of counteract gravity um if I if this was a pogo stick and I sort of compressed
    it and then threw it then it hit then it would have a bunch of spring potential
    energy that when it hit the ground it might bounce additionally but if we assume
    the simple rigid body uh physics then that kinetic and potential energy is going
    to sort of yeah have this nice conservative tradeoff this will become important
    later um so now we get to my favorite part um which I will will only be just a
    little taster uh and then we will talk at about this at length next time and that&amp;#39;s
    the concept of the center of mass um the center of mass is a term in physics you
    probably heard it in some it comes up a lot in like uh you know Sports and especially
    anything related like gymnastics and balance stuff like that you hear people talk
    about the center of mass as um like the position of your body um run out of time
    here I&amp;#39;ll just do it so the center of mass is um the average position
    of all of the oops excuse me is the average position of all of the objects of
    all the components of the larger object so if I were to take this tube and cut
    it up into 1 cm long sections and then took the position of those sections relative
    to a zero point or any zero point and took the average of all of them it would
    be in the middle of the thing and that is the center of mass and it turns out
    that when you&amp;#39;re supporting something above the ground you do it by supporting
    the center of mass of the thing so if I were to hold it over here then the center
    of mass would fall and it wouldn&amp;#39;t stay on my hand um if I were to put
    a weight so these are like ankle weights they look like they&amp;#39;re from like
    the &amp;#39;90s I also found them on the street near my house there&amp;#39;s
    like a place for people in the neighborhood just like put sort of like garbage
    before like before it goes away um and I found these and they&amp;#39;re sort
    of useful for this so by putting this it weighs like a pound I think so like half
    a kilogram um and so now before it was on here this thing was of uniform density
    so the center of mass was in the middle of it now it&amp;#39;s not of uniform
    density so the center of mass shifts to here now this is the center of mass of
    the system so now when I want to support the system I have to take into account
    the shift and density of all the things that are a part of that system um and
    so if we really wanted to we could determine how much this thing weighs in units
    of stick by measuring the distance between this balance point and the center of
    the stick which is where we would balance it on if it it was symmetrically oriented
    like that um I don&amp;#39;t want to but we could uh and that concept of balance
    as the relationship between the center of mass and the base of support is something
    we&amp;#39;re going to talk about a lot uh yeah but um but yeah so similarly so
    we talked a little bit about um the concept of like reductionist approaches to
    Scientific studies which is like trying to trying to nail down like that the problem
    I said before like I&amp;#39;m I want to measure this thing that I care about
    but I don&amp;#39;t have the ability to measure all the parts of it with the precis
    that I need to do that one approach to to dealing with that problem is to narrow
    your focus and rather than trying to explain the entire complexity of the thing
    that&amp;#39;s moving which is not available for empirical measurement you can
    look at a smaller and smaller and smaller piece of it um and so instead of looking
    at the whole body you might sort of look at just the movement of like a single
    joint or something like that or the single arm or something like that um and keep
    that same sort of full level of fidelity of still thinking about this weird shape
    in you in terms of like a thing that has all of these joint angles that can Define
    it its position at a given point in time um but even for something like this which
    is a a massive simplification of of of a human this is still a pretty complex
    object physically speaking like there&amp;#39;s still a lot of joints that can
    vary and you have as many degrees of freedom as you have joints times two or three
    depending on how you count so Define the position the the ident the position of
    this kinematic object in space requires a lot of different numbers and that&amp;#39;s
    going to be sort of hard to deal with um the other approach is to just simplify
    down the system that you&amp;#39;re looking at into a a massive oversimplification
    um and and try to do that in such a way that still allows you to say things about
    the system as a whole so like and that&amp;#39;s basically what the idea of the
    center of mass is so rather than thinking about this whole complex thing with
    all the joints and all the muscles and all the the blood pumping and all the sort
    of the the biological realities going on there um we can instead uh condense it
    down [Music] into a simplified system so this is something I made some years ago
    um and this is just showing a guy doing a handstands a French parkour Vista named
    simonster and the X here is his full body Center of mass which is measured as
    the weighted sum of each of these body segments so the segment of the forearm
    the the upper arm the head the chest the legs you take the average of all those
    positions uh weighted by the mass of that object so like the forearm weighs a
    lot less than the legs for example this is the position that you get and then
    if you measure the limits of the base of support here um as the the distance between
    the tips of his fingers to the heel of his hand which those are the places where
    you can put Force into the ground the center of mass always stays within that
    space so you can know that even though there&amp;#39;s a lot going on here biologically
    from a physics perspective that you can Define the task of balance using these
    sort of very hyper simplified models of the body which take the entire complexity
    of a human person and boil it down to a singular Point Mass which in this case
    is in two Dimensions but it could be in three dimensions and we have now um simplified
    the world down to a place that starts to feel more tractable uh I can handle this
    many numbers I can&amp;#39;t I can kind of handle this many numbers but not really
    um but this is a place where uh if you by the way in on the list on the the notes
    if you click on on this where is it uh Co gifts it goes to a link to a bunch of
    those types of animations that I made we&amp;#39;ll talk about them more later
    um oh do that there we go um yeah and so so you can reduce down this complex object
    of a human down to a singular Point Mass and physics has told us I I believe it&amp;#39;s
    like the finite element theorem or something like that but I&amp;#39;m not really
    100% sure on that it&amp;#39;s basically says that things that you say about the
    center of mass of a system are true to some extent of the other object of all
    the objects in that system so talking about the center of mass of that person
    um is a valid approximation of what the full picture would be if if I was measuring
    every single sort of cube of his body you know at at the same time um you&amp;#39;re
    obviously going to be losing a lot of of of information so if I&amp;#39;m only
    thinking about the suar this one&amp;#39;s another wacky guy so if I&amp;#39;m
    boiling down this guy&amp;#39;s entire body to this singular Mass I can no longer
    really say things about the joint angles or the forces at the elbow stuff like
    that but I can determine whether or not he&amp;#39;s in a stable regime or an
    unstable regime and I can measure things like what&amp;#39;s happening at the
    physics level when he shifts hand from one position to the other and I can use
    this belief about the physics of his body to start trying to infer what some of
    these Wiggles and movements actually mean so like when it why like without this
    sort of center of mass analysis it might be hard to explain why his arm is out
    here it might they might not have much to say about that but when you&amp;#39;re
    thinking about it like this it becomes very easy like he sticks his arm out so
    that his Center like if I move my arm and leg like this the average of them keeps
    my body over my foot um and I I can do this but I can&amp;#39;t I can&amp;#39;t
    do that it&amp;#39;s anyway you&amp;#39;ll figure it out um I&amp;#39;ll show
    you visual representations of this once you actually get the the numbers next
    week um right and then yeah uh and you might ask the question of how do we do
    these measurements how do we get these numbers and soort how do I know where to
    draw the segment Center of mass for his torso versus how like what percentage
    of a body weight is a forearm like how do you get those numbers uh well it turns
    out we just we have these lookup tables this is called anthropometry um yeah and
    these are just this this is statistics Oh wrong way ah um right um so these particular
    lookup tables come from a guy named David winter uh this is copied from a textbook
    of his from like 1995 or something like that and it shows these measurements of
    the shoulder is 0.129 H where H is the body height and so he and then these are
    the lookup table for these segments so the forearm is defined as the dist as the
    the space between the elbow axis in theer styloid I guess is here uh it&amp;#39;s
    028 of an M which is a body mass and the center of mass is4 36% of the wave from
    the the proximal joint which is the one towards the middle towards the distal
    joint which is the one that&amp;#39;s farther away so if you add these two numbers
    up they add equal one um so you kind of you can use these numbers to to calculate
    these values and these numbers were basically statistics of they chopped up a
    bunch of dead people in Meed um it was like Air Force research I believe and there&amp;#39;s
    a lot of so and they were they were all like older men um so there are other newer
    tables now that have people of different ages and people you know different genders
    and things like that in the end it doesn&amp;#39;t super matter for a lot of like
    the numbers are slightly different you know women have a lower Center of mass
    then you know blah blah blah um but for the levels of analysis that we tend to
    be looking at in terms of like this type of physics or like you know where your
    where your body mass is going when you&amp;#39;re moving your your feet around
    the distances the the differences between those estimates for the different sort
    of categories of human um are just not they&amp;#39;re below the level of precision
    that we have for our measurements for most cases so I tend to just keep using
    these because you know it&amp;#39;s available and I don&amp;#39;t have to if you
    if you look up paper on anthropometry tables you&amp;#39;ll find all sorts of
    new stuff about oh we chopped up a bunch of athletic people and non-athletic people
    and older people and younger people and da da da d da um and and great good job
    for them um yeah okay pendul pendul are my favorite thing we&amp;#39;ll talk about
    them next week uh balance will&amp;#39;ll talk about and then this is color there
    we go um and then someday we&amp;#39;ll also talk about projective geometry which
    is the same which this is this is what cameras and vision and stuff is and they
    are it&amp;#39;s the same math except this one is about light instead of physics
    but it&amp;#39;s the same kind of idea you project stuff and this whole thing
    um and then eyeballs and stuff like that so okay that was a lot uh hope you got
    something out of it um it will not be on the test there is no test uh it&amp;#39;s
    just it&amp;#39;s much more try to internalize it try to conceptualize it try
    to think more about the concepts than the details um and think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s
    it&amp;#39;s better to think about like how would you recreate this story when
    you&amp;#39;re telling it to someone else than it is to remember anything specific
    about what I said um because notice a lot of it was just kind of like reconstructed
    from first principles and so it&amp;#39;s useful to be able to do that so try
    to tell the story to someone else that you know later and then when you hit Parts
    it&amp;#39;s like wait why how did you get from there to there think about it
    ask those questions okay um cool uh thank you we&amp;#39;ll talk more about this
    next week and we&amp;#39;ll talk about pendula which is the best pendulums they&amp;#39;re
    my favorite we&amp;#39;ll talk all about it okay hie'

    text: "Okay, hello, hello, hi! Thank you, and welcome to whatever this is. Let's\
      \ do the standard check-in. I am recording this, and we will be posting it online.\
      \ A couple of people have been sporadically contacting me and saying, \"Hey,\
      \ I'm sick, I'm not going to make it to class\" or \"Hey, I'm not going to make\
      \ the deadline,\" that sort of stuff. If you're sick, don\u2019t come to class.\
      \ We went through a pandemic, so let's learn that lesson as a culture. You don\u2019\
      t need to check with me; it\u2019s totally fine. I trust you. Also, the deadlines\
      \ are all kind of made up. I put them there with the hope that everyone has\
      \ it done by this point because I use the data from that for each stage, but\
      \ they\u2019re all available until the end of the semester. With the exception\
      \ of the poster thing, there are a couple of hard deadlines for that because\
      \ you have to get it to the printer on time and stuff like that. Everything\
      \ else, just get it done as soon as you can, which I understand is a dangerous\
      \ thing to say to some people, but I trust you. I believe in you. Just check\
      \ all the boxes before the end of the semester, and we'll be good to go.\n\n\
      Now, a quick check-in on schedules and stuff. What did we do last Wednesday?\
      \ Can you remind me? Did I talk or did we do the group thing? Yes, the group\
      \ thing. The group thing was good. Great! And today, for fun, we\u2019re going\
      \ to be talking about a lecture that I\u2019ve given a bunch of times, and I\
      \ always enjoy giving it. It's going to be an introduction to measurement and\
      \ the concepts pertaining to that. Check this out! When you\u2019re in charge,\
      \ there\u2019s no assignment! I feel like we\u2019ve been doing enough. You\
      \ guys are doing great.\n\nOh, is this the right day? Yes, it is. Cool. So today\u2019\
      s lecture will be about measurement units and related topics. It has a lot of\
      \ props and visual aids, and I want to do it now because on Wednesday, I think\
      \ we can do a free motion capture in-class recording, which will be our first\
      \ relationship with more classical data. I keep referring to the text stuff\
      \ that you\u2019re inputting into the server as data, and it is data. But, you\
      \ know, if you asked me three years ago if that was data, I would have said,\
      \ \"Yeah, I guess technically,\" but it\u2019s only since AI came online that\
      \ I think of it as data.\n\nFreeo Cap is a motion capture, sort of open-source\
      \ project that I've been building for the past half-decade. It\u2019s specifically\
      \ designed to make good class demos, so we\u2019ll be recording some data and\
      \ then talking about it in the context of the concepts we\u2019re going to cover\
      \ today. Hopefully, we can get some of that in today.\n\nLet\u2019s see if there's\
      \ anything else to catch up on. Just for completeness, I will remind everybody,\
      \ although nothing special has happened with this round, in the server, in the\
      \ links and resources, find the server scrape checkpoint. At the bottom is the\
      \ same sort of 127. That\u2019s the server scraped and analyzed as of this morning.\
      \ Same process: download it, unzip it. If you don\u2019t know what unzipping\
      \ is, it\u2019s the thing where you double-click, and it makes a folder next\
      \ door that you can open like a regular thing. You can search for your name\
      \ in there.\n\nI\u2019m going to be refactoring the way we do the student profile\
      \ building. Your individual profiles are going to change probably next week\
      \ because I\u2019m going to adjust the code and prompts that create them. I\
      \ realized that it would probably give you a much more precise measurement of\
      \ what you\u2019re interested in if I didn\u2019t use everything you put in\
      \ the server for the profile but just the assignment chats\u2014the ones from\
      \ your intro and the poster presentation. I\u2019m also in the process of setting\
      \ something up so that in a given chat, you can ask the bot to remember you,\
      \ and it will pull that history into the conversation. That way, you don\u2019\
      t have to start every conversation from scratch.\n\nAlso, just to remind you\
      \ as we help you learn the paths and whatnot, here we are on the server. Same\
      \ channel up here\u2014links and resources and course repository. Click on that,\
      \ and something pops up. I don\u2019t know why two things pop up. This is the\
      \ course repository; it\u2019s the most up-to-date. Oh, actually, I forgot to\
      \ update this last time. Syllabus commit in sync. Yes, thank you; don\u2019\
      t break.\n\nNow, the text is updated. This is GitHub; that\u2019s kind of what\
      \ GitHub does. It\u2019s version control software, like track changes but more\
      \ sophisticated. Pretty much every piece of software you\u2019ve ever used in\
      \ your life has used Git at some level, and I\u2019m kind of hijacking it to\
      \ do text-based stuff. Just to be clear, for fun, this site is like a folder.\
      \ The README here is what\u2019s posted down there. This is what it looks like\
      \ formatted, and that\u2019s what it looks like raw. This is an honest measurement\
      \ and record of exactly what my primate body did to a keyboard at some point\
      \ in time, so it is a truth-preserving record of my thoughts in a way that a\
      \ DOCX file or a Google Drive link will never be.\n\nSo, shout out to Markdown\
      \ and raw text formats. Now, on this page, go back to the front page. In the\
      \ lectures folder for Intro to Measurement, the top one is called 'Intro to\
      \ Measurement.' Here we go; it\u2019s my notes for the lecture that we\u2019\
      re about to give. With that, I\u2019m going to switch away from GitHub and go\
      \ to my local version because I want to. Local meaning on this machine, not\
      \ on the internet. GitHub is owned by Microsoft, so technically that state data\

      \ summary. We\u2019ll see how much we get through. I think we\u2019ll get through\
      \ all of it. We are in this class extensively to teach you what science is,\
      \ what science looks like, and how you might ever attempt to know the world\
      \ and do empirical research within it. There are many things that get taken\
      \ for granted when you just live as a human in the world, but you start to find\
      \ yourself needing to get much more specific about once you start trying to\
      \ engage in knowledge generation. The idea as a scientist is that you are attempting\
      \ to create new knowledge for humankind, which is a very difficult thing to\
      \ do. It's hard to know things, and there are certain rules for how to do that.\
      \ A lot of what we talk about in the empirical sciences is based on the concept\
      \ of empirical measurement. There are many ways to understand things; the scientific\
      \ method and empirical method is one way to know the world."

    text: "A very powerful way to know the world is through empirical measurements,\
      \ as it allows you to make predictions about the future, build tools, and heal\
      \ people when they are sick. Everything in this conception of knowledge is based,\
      \ at some level, on empirical measurement. We will discuss what that means.\
      \ Essentially, it is the idea that you have conducted some type of measurement,\
      \ and this term \u2018measurement\u2019 is one that gets taken for granted.\
      \ We will explore its meaning further.\n\nOne of the most important things to\
      \ consider when thinking about empirical research and the concept of measurement\
      \ is that everything you are doing and building has to be relative to something\
      \ else. When you are trying to generate new knowledge, that knowledge is based\
      \ on previous understandings. I used the term 'truth preserving' earlier, which\
      \ is significant in the philosophy of science. This concept refers to the ability\
      \ to build upon known facts to understand new information.\n\nEverything that\
      \ you think you know about the world is based on a background of beliefs formed\
      \ from your experiences and learning. Thus, it is helpful to recreate these\
      \ epistemological chains\u2014where epistemology is the study of knowledge\u2014\
      and ask yourself where these connections lead. If I were to revisit this topic,\
      \ I would start with the idea that skepticism is the basis of scientific reality.\
      \ Skepticism is the idea that you must have reasons to believe what you believe;\
      \ you cannot just accept things without cause. Everything you consider must\
      \ be examined directly to understand its connections.\n\nGiven that, it is reasonable\
      \ to inquire about origins and the philosophical bedrock of belief, often attributed\
      \ to Ren\xE9 Descartes, who theorized in the 1500s. You may have heard of Cartesian\
      \ coordinates and other concepts he introduced, which we will discuss at various\
      \ points. He engaged in a philosophical exercise to understand the foundation\
      \ of his knowledge and introduced the phrase \"Cogito, ergo sum,\" meaning \"\
      I think, therefore I am.\" This phrase encapsulates the idea that the only certainty\
      \ you can have without referencing other pieces of knowledge is that you are\
      \ experiencing consciousness right now. Nothing in the universe could replicate\
      \ the experience of being consciously aware in this moment.\n\nYour memories\
      \ and perceptions, however, can be misleading. You might believe there is a\
      \ cup in front of you, but in truth, you could be hallucinating or experiencing\
      \ a simulated reality. All of these aspects can be subjects of skepticism\u2014\
      doubts can be cast upon the veracity of everything except for that fundamental\
      \ experience of consciousness. If you choose to hold onto this nihilistic belief,\
      \ you arrive at solipsism, the view that only your mind is sure to exist, and\
      \ that everything else is an illusion. While this is a defensible philosophical\
      \ position, it is not useful, helpful, or particularly interesting.\n\nIf you\
      \ are open to accepting other gradients of belief and truth in your life, you\
      \ can begin to construct a sense of knowledge about the real world. This involves\
      \ trusting in memories and statistics so that you can build a framework of understanding.\
      \ For example, I might doubt the existence of the cup before me, but as I observe\
      \ it repeatedly and interact with it\u2014reaching out, holding it, and drinking\
      \ from it\u2014the accumulation of sensory experiences begins to resemble knowledge\
      \ about the real world. It becomes increasingly plausible that there is indeed\
      \ something resembling a cup outside of my consciousness.\n\nThis framework\
      \ allows us to connect in this universe, sharing memories and statistics. While\
      \ it\u2019s a bit concerning to ponder too deeply into this, from an epistemological\
      \ perspective, we will base our knowledge on our awareness of existence, which\
      \ is solid. Moreover, we have memory and statistics\u2014though limited, we\
      \ can work with that.\n\nNow, I will shift away from this philosophical discussion\
      \ to focus on the empirical realm of direct measurements. We will explore how\
      \ we measure things. Let\u2019s begin with a basic measurement: distance. I\
      \ have various makeshift props and visual aids crafted from materials I found\
      \ outside. For instance, this stick is about a meter long and can be taken apart;\
      \ it was initially part of a lamp I discarded. So, let's consider this stick\
      \ as a measuring tool. If we were to measure lengths, we might use this stick\
      \ or a tape measure.\n\nLet\u2019s say we are trying to measure the length of\
      \ a room or how tall an object is. We would eventually record these measurements.\
      \ We currently have various ways to measure space and time, and we will start\
      \ with space and later address time in this lecture, which won\u2019t take too\
      \ long."

    text: "Not to worry about it. The first thing you might want to consider when\
      \ measuring things are dimensions. You have one-dimensional, two-dimensional,\
      \ three-dimensional, and high-dimensional spaces. We'll talk about these things\
      \ in a second. In all these cases, it starts with something resembling an origin.\
      \ The origin is a zero-dimensional object. It contains no real information other\
      \ than that it exists. This is a point that doesn't exist\u2014this is a point\
      \ that does exist. So, this point conveys the information, \"Hello, yes I exist,\"\
      \ but not really that much else. It's not particularly useful scientifically,\
      \ but it's very important when you're trying to figure out measurements. If\
      \ I come to you and say, \"Oh, hey, that thing is three and a half sticks long,\"\
      \ that is implicitly relative to something that is zero sticks long, which has\
      \ no extent. So, zero-dimensional, great, good job.\n\nNow, let's think about\
      \ this dimension and call it X, because that's traditionally how we do it. This\
      \ is now a one-dimensional object. Let's say this is infinitely long and we\u2019\
      ve measured this as one stick long, so there you go, one stick long. I can measure\
      \ two sticks, three sticks, etc. That's way better. Now, if I'm going around\
      \ measuring things, I can keep track of the length of things. However, again,\
      \ this is not particularly exciting. There's not really a point to drawing it;\
      \ you just write down the number. You don\u2019t gain anything by looking at\
      \ that number relative to zero other than just understanding how numbers work.\
      \ So, we're going to call that X, and we\u2019re also going to call that length.\n\
      \nThat's great for measuring things like string or distances from here to your\
      \ house, or the height of a person. But now, we want to measure different things.\
      \ We\u2019re still measuring length and distances, and now we\u2019re going\
      \ to introduce a second dimension that we'll call Y. We'll also call that height,\
      \ and it uses the same unit. So, you can still be one stick tall or two sticks\
      \ tall. Now, you can measure things like boards, desks, and floors. If you measure\
      \ something that\u2019s two units long and then one unit tall, that's a point\
      \ in that space; it\u2019s a two-dimensional point. Two-dimensional means it\
      \ has two numbers you need to use to define it. In the robotics world, someday,\
      \ we'll ramp up from here. But another way to think about this is that it has\
      \ two degrees of freedom. If you want to know the area of something, you need\
      \ to know two numbers to define that entirely: you need length and width. This\
      \ is a two-dimensional number.\n\nNow, you want to keep going\u2014keep measuring\
      \ in higher-dimensional spaces. You have length, and area, which is length times\
      \ width. Now, you want to measure volume, and with that, I have run out of dimensions\
      \ on the board. I can no longer represent a three-dimensional space on this\
      \ two-dimensional object. However, we can fake it by using a right-angle approach.\
      \ Let\u2019s call this back here Z and think about how we do this: so one, two,\
      \ and then one, two, three. This is XZ, and we can also paint that up. It\u2019\
      s a little complex, but you get it: X, Y, Z. Great, this is a three-dimensional\
      \ point. We\u2019ve done it! This way, you can measure objects according to\
      \ their volume and the need for three degrees of freedom; you need three numbers\
      \ to define that volume specifically. You can represent that spatially in this\
      \ nice three-dimensional grid.\n\nI don't want to belabor this point too much\
      \ because we will get there. This is three-dimensional space; if you ever step\
      \ into engineering, this is the international symbol for three-dimensional space:\
      \ X, Y, Z. This follows the right-hand rule\u2014doing it backwards here, but\
      \ it would be, yes, like this: X, Y, Z. This is a left-handed coordinate system;\
      \ it\u2019s typically illegal, so don\u2019t do this due to conventional rules.\
      \ There\u2019s more to be said there, but we can skip past it.\n\nIn three-dimensional\
      \ space, humans are very good at spatial estimates. We excel at quick calculations\
      \ of spatial relationships, like determining whether a cup is in front of a\
      \ bottle or if it\u2019s near the edge of a table. Those kinds of spatial computations\
      \ are very easy for us. Now, there\u2019s nothing special about three dimensions.\
      \ That\u2019s just how many you need to define space and time. However, you\
      \ can keep adding numbers to define something that requires more than three\
      \ numbers.\n\nI don\u2019t want to belabor this point too much, but I will say\
      \ that it involves the Pythagorean theorem and how you measure things like distance.\
      \ In one dimension, the distance from a point to the origin is trivial. The\
      \ classic formula is A\xB2 + B\xB2 = C\xB2, and in the context of a one-dimensional\
      \ space, it\u2019s very straightforward. You can scale this to two dimensions\
      \ by replacing A and B with X and Y, which gives you a method to measure distance\
      \ in a two-dimensional space. In three-dimensional space, to measure distance,\
      \ you simply add Z. The distance in three-dimensional space is the square root\
      \ of X\xB2 + Y\xB2 + Z\xB2. You can keep going; there's nothing special about\
      \ two dimensions. You can add a W, an L, an M, and just keep going. You may\
      \ lose the ability to plot it in a meaningful way, but you can still perform\
      \ all the same math you did with three dimensions, extending it into millions\
      \ of dimensions.\n\nMuch of the AI work operates by using this kind of spatial\
      \ math but in very high-dimensional spaces\u2014a term you might hear as high-dimensional\
      \ mathematics. It sounds complex, but it essentially entails adding numbers\
      \ to the Pythagorean theorem to measure distance, and everything else remains\
      \ fairly consistent. I will also say that while we will cover general mathematical\
      \ concepts here, you won\u2019t have to handle any actual math; you just need\
      \ to understand it, which is much easier. I know that there\u2019s a section\
      \ where I\u2019ll say you can have two X, Y variables, and that may make intuitive\
      \ sense. I just need to assure you that that intuitive gut check\u2014that makes\
      \ rough sense\u2014is the vast majority of what you need to know about mathematics.\
      \ Being able to perform the math on paper can help, but I firmly believe that\
      \ understanding the concepts is what truly matters. \n\nLet\u2019s simplify\
      \ and go back down to two dimensions because it's easier. There we go, 2D. Great."

    text: "Cartesian coordinates are named after Ren\xE9 Descartes, who is said to\
      \ have been a sickly individual. While lying in bed, he observed a fly crawling\
      \ on the window and realized he could define the fly's position by determining\
      \ the intersection point between the fly and two points on the windowsill. This\
      \ led to the establishment of formalizations, and consequently, the naming of\
      \ the concepts of a grid after him, which I find quite annoying. Cartesian space\
      \ is typically characterized by straight lines, grids, and squares. When moving\
      \ from two dimensions to three dimensions, for instance, a square becomes a\
      \ cube. \n\nIt's also possible to define points in space using angular coordinates.\
      \ If I consider this point in space, I can describe it using right-angled projections\
      \ onto basis vector axes. For example, I might reference its distance at a defined\
      \ angle from zero. By starting with what we call the X-axis and then moving\
      \ upward by a specific angle, which can be measured in degrees or radians, I\
      \ can then extend outward by a distance, R, arriving at the same position in\
      \ 2D space.\n\nInstead of defining this using XY coordinates, I can also define\
      \ it using polar coordinates, which consist of the angle (theta) and the radius\
      \ (rho). The radius simply refers to the distance, akin to a circle's radius.\
      \ This is relevant because, when we are dealing with a two-dimensional point,\
      \ which has two degrees of freedom, I can define it either in linear XY coordinates\
      \ or in angular theta-rho coordinates. It is necessary to have two numbers to\
      \ establish its position.\n\nNext, let's consider how to visualize these concepts:\
      \ moving from 2D to 3D results in spheres. Importantly, you can always switch\
      \ back and forth between linear coordinate systems and spherical coordinate\
      \ systems, which we refer to as polar coordinates versus Cartesian coordinates.\
      \ In practice, depending on the nature of the mathematical problem, you will\
      \ often transition between these coordinate systems. For example, when looking\
      \ at joint angles, it is more practical to use polar coordinates, as they incorporate\
      \ angles. Additionally, if I assume the distance remains constant\u2014given\
      \ that we are dealing with rigid bodies\u2014I only need one number to define\
      \ its position instead of two, which simplifies calculations.\n\nWe have primarily\
      \ discussed ways of measuring space, but it is also important to consider time.\
      \ You\u2019ll encounter terms like spatiotemporal coordinates or spatiotemporal\
      \ calibration. Remember that \"spatiotemporal\" indicates that we are considering\
      \ both space and time. When analyzing data, this is often represented in 2D\
      \ plots, where the x-axis represents time and the y-axis represents some measurement\
      \ over that time frame. For example, let us say the height of my hand above\
      \ the ground is measured. At time zero, my hand is one unit above the ground.\
      \ After waiting for one second, I measure it again, and it reads one and a half\
      \ units. If I continue lifting my hand and record these measurements over time,\
      \ they form a sequential series called a time series.\n\nThis type of measurement\
      \ is fundamentally one-dimensional; I'm measuring height and recording my hand's\
      \ position at discrete time intervals, like upward movements every second, or\
      \ potentially even more frequently if recorded in frames per second, such as\
      \ video recordings. This is important, as the representation would suggest a\
      \ continuous line of movement; however, you are primarily gathering discrete\
      \ measurements. If we assume the movement between intervals is reasonably consistent,\
      \ we can connect those points to create a more visually coherent time series.\
      \ But if we only record data at every second, the motion could be quite different,\
      \ leading to misrepresentation if we were to interpolate and fill in the gaps.\n\
      \nAs an aside, both space and time can be perceived in two basic forms: linear\
      \ time (like a stopwatch) and phasic time (analogous to a clock that resets\
      \ to zero). If you're familiar with calculus, the derivative of position gives\
      \ you the velocity (the change in position over time), and the derivative of\
      \ velocity gives you the acceleration. In essence, velocity is the derivative\
      \ of position, while acceleration is the derivative of velocity. You can also\
      \ revert back using integrals, which is the extent of calculus that I find most\
      \ relevant.\n\nWe have been discussing measurement in abstract units, which\
      \ are applicable regardless of specific values\u2014for example, we could measure\
      \ distance in meters, temperature in Celsius or Kelvin, or weight in kilograms.\
      \ This flexibility is something to bear in mind, especially as you navigate\
      \ different scientific disciplines. However, it's worth noting that there are\
      \ rules concerning the units we use within scientific contexts. In America,\
      \ we have systems such as imperial units (feet and inches), which can be quite\
      \ cumbersome. Some argue they are outdated, and there's some validity to that;\
      \ however, these imperial units often rely on easily factorable numbers, like\
      \ 12 and 16, making them practical for calculations in everyday environments.\
      \ In contrast, the metric system, while excellent for precision and decimal\
      \ representation, may offer fewer options for evenly divisible numbers, as you\
      \ can only divide 10 into factors of two and five. In historical contexts, when\
      \ vendors had to measure and weigh goods, using factors like 12 and 16 proved\
      \ to be more manageable for everyday transactions, such as baking and similar\
      \ tasks, because it allowed for easier fractions."

    text: "In the sciences, we are required by convention to use SI units. SI units\
      \ stands for Standard International; it's a French term that means International\
      \ Standard. There are a set number of them. Here is the Wikipedia page listing\
      \ all of the base SI units. For time, we have seconds; for length, we have meters;\
      \ for mass, we have kilograms; for electrical current, we have amperes; for\
      \ thermodynamic temperature, we have Kelvin; for the amount of substance, we\
      \ have mole; and for luminous intensity, we have candela. For the most part,\
      \ we'll be mostly thinking about these units: seconds, meters, and kilograms.\n\
      \nOne of the interesting aspects of the metric system is that many parts match\
      \ up. Let\u2019s pretend this is one meter and this is one liter, as it claims\
      \ to be. This is everything we would need to recreate the majority of the metric\
      \ system. A liter is defined as 1,000 milliliters; a milliliter is a cubic centimeter\
      \ of water, and a cubic centimeter of water weighs one gram. If you create a\
      \ cube that is one centimeter on each side and fill it with water, the weight\
      \ of that cube is one gram. If you gather a thousand of those cubic centimeters,\
      \ they would equate to one kilogram, and one liter weighs one kilogram. This\
      \ correspondence allows us to recreate many of the units that we use.\n\nTraditionally,\
      \ the meter was measured by a physical stick in France, but it has since rusted\
      \ away over time. Now, it represents markings on a stone. We have since moved\
      \ away from this method for determining a meter, and now we measure it in terms\
      \ of the distance that light travels. I can't remember exactly how we used to\
      \ measure seconds, but it involved the period of a pendulum of a specific length.\
      \ We now measure seconds based on the oscillation of a cesium atom, which oscillates\
      \ at a very regular interval. We measure meters by the distance that light travels\
      \ in the time it takes for these oscillations of a cesium atom. This measurement\
      \ was designed to provide more precision for modern measurements.\n\nThese are\
      \ the only base units required for proper science. If you're conducting a scientific\
      \ study or measurement and need to report numbers, you're not permitted to use\
      \ inches; you must use meters. You can choose to use centimeters, millimeters,\
      \ or kilometers, depending on what makes sense for your measurement, but using\
      \ inches or feet is not allowed. Similarly, when measuring mass, you must use\
      \ kilograms instead of pounds. This guideline is enforced by the scientific\
      \ community; if you publish a paper in a scientific journal and include measurements\
      \ in feet or pounds, it will likely be sent back for conversion to SI units.\n\
      \nOne question to consider is why the list of possible units is so constrained.\
      \ The reason is that these base units correspond to measurable quantities that\
      \ we can assess with our basic tools. They boil down to basic quantities or\
      \ derived combinations of these quantities: time, spatial extent, mass, electrical\
      \ current, temperature in Kelvin, countable amount in moles, and light intensity\
      \ in candelas. When we consider sensory systems and the energies they absorb\
      \ to provide us with empirical estimates of our environment, we can connect\
      \ these basic units to our perceptions like sight, sound, touch, and taste.\
      \ However, for more complex measurements, we must create new units.\n\nFor instance,\
      \ to measure velocity\u2014how fast something moves through space\u2014we can't\
      \ rely solely on the base units. We combine them to express velocity in terms\
      \ like meters per second, which is derived from the ratio of meters to seconds.\
      \ The SI units for velocity are meters per second, although you might use millimeters\
      \ per second for slower speeds or kilometers per second for faster speeds.\n\
      \nAs we approach the topic of this course, which is neuroscience, it\u2019s\
      \ important to note that biomechanics plays a significant role. Many of you\
      \ have inquired about biomechanics, which broadly refers to applying classic\
      \ Newtonian physics to biological systems, typically involving a musculoskeletal\
      \ framework. Next week, we will collect data in class, focusing on standing\
      \ balance. For example, consider the unusual act of balancing a mass of approximately\
      \ 100 kilograms on such small, flexible joints as our legs. If I were to place\
      \ 200 kilograms of steel on a similarly small base, it would create a dangerous\
      \ situation, but healthy humans perform such feats millions of times a year.\
      \ If you take 20,000 steps a day\u2014quite common for graduate students\u2014\
      then, over a year, you're approaching a million steps. This demonstrates the\
      \ challenges and principles of biomechanics as we explore this fascinating field."

      \ nervous system is electrifying and firing your muscles in the right way at\
      \ the appropriate intervals to keep you from falling over. This is something\
      \ we don't really think about, but once you start thinking about it, there's\
      \ a lot going on. My particular approach to studying this involves boiling it\
      \ down to first principles, measuring the behavior in basic units of geometry\
      \ and physics, and then trying to infer about the unmeasurable parts of the\
      \ system, which are the neural firings based on the physics and geometry of\

      \ position, which refers to where I am in space; velocity, which describes how\
      \ I am moving in space; and then we move into fancier terms like force. For\

      \ ahead to Newton\u2019s Laws of Motion, we have the fundamental equation: force\
      \ equals mass times acceleration. We\u2019ve all heard that one before. I will\
      \ leave this as an exercise for you. If you take mass, measured in kilograms,\
      \ and multiply it by acceleration, in meters per second squared, you will get\
      \ a unit called Newtons.\n\nNow, if we apply a force over a given distance,\
      \ we have something we call work. Work is just force applied over distance,\
      \ which gives us kilograms times meters squared times seconds squared, resulting\
      \ in a unit called a joule, which is a unit of energy. Energy, defined as the\
      \ ability to do work, is conserved. For example, in the famous equation E =\
      \ mc\xB2, energy equals mass in kilograms times C, where C is the speed of light\
      \ in meters per second squared.\n\nThis is a good example of how these concepts\
      \ boil down to SI units, and once you get to energy, we touch upon the classic\
      \ physics principle of the conservation of energy. This law states that in a\
      \ closed system, energy is neither created nor destroyed; it merely changes\
      \ form. This belief in the conservation of energy is strongly held in physics,\
      \ and it serves as an assumption I can use as a scientist to make sense of the\
      \ complex data we will measure when observing the intricacies of a person moving\
      \ through space.\n\nWe can also discuss normalized units. Although SI units\
      \ for things like mass are essential, using kilograms to measure a person moving\
      \ through space can become cumbersome. For instance, if I am 100 kilograms,\
      \ it feels awkward to continually use that figure in calculations. To simplify\
      \ matters, we can normalize mass by dividing our measurements by the person's\
      \ body weight. Now, we work with units of body mass or body weight rather than\
      \ constantly using kilograms, making calculations much easier.\n\nSo now, as\
      \ we inch our way toward understanding humans, we consider them as one of these\
      \ approximations. We\u2019ve navigated the spatial measurement, unit concepts,\
      \ and can now start thinking through the lens of physics. Physics describes\
      \ how objects move through the world, and I focus on classical mechanics, which\
      \ is essentially Newton\u2019s three laws as they apply to simple mechanical\
      \ objects, akin to cannonball physics. \n\nThis ties into a philosophy of science\
      \ concept: all our theories are wrong at various points in time. Newton's Laws,\
      \ which emerged in the 1700s while he attempted to explain planetary motion,\
      \ provided simple rules for mechanics that were useful for many physical phenomena.\
      \ They explain many planetary motions but do not accurately predict the orbit\
      \ of Mercury. Even during Newton's time, predictions for Mercury\u2019s trajectory\
      \ did not match observations. They even hypothesized a planet called Vulcan\
      \ existing between Mercury and Venus to account for these anomalies. Eventually,\
      \ Einstein introduced relativity theory, which, although mathematically more\
      \ complex, successfully explained Mercury's orbit by acknowledging gravitational\
      \ effects that warp space-time, eliminating the need for the hypothetical planet\
      \ Vulcan. Thus, we learn that Newton\u2019s Laws, while useful, do not provide\
      \ a complete picture of our physical universe."

    text: "As human beings on this planet, we tend to care about accuracy. The accuracy\
      \ you get when you use Newton's Laws is around nine to ten decimal places. The\
      \ difference between the prediction of a ball's motion in Newtonian mechanics\
      \ and the same prediction in relativistic mechanics is so far below our ability\
      \ to measure the position that we only relate to relativity when looking at\
      \ things like planets on the scale of stars. Therefore, we still rely on Newtonian\
      \ mechanics for almost everything we do in our daily lives, even though we know\
      \ it is not as accurate as relativistic physics. There's a lot to be said there,\
      \ but let's keep moving.\n\nSo, Newton's Laws consist of three principles. The\
      \ first law states that a body at rest or in motion tends to stay at rest or\
      \ in motion unless acted upon by a force, which is a concept known as inertia.\
      \ The second law, arguably my favorite, states that force equals mass times\
      \ acceleration. In rotational space, it becomes torque equals moment of inertia\
      \ times angular acceleration, but let's not worry about that.\n\nEssentially,\
      \ if you consider me as a mass, and my mass is not changing, we can ignore the\
      \ mass component because it is constant. We can focus on the force equals acceleration\
      \ aspect. I\u2019m not moving; I'm not accelerating, which means that the sum\
      \ of forces acting on my body must equal zero. If it didn\u2019t, I would be\
      \ moving. Therefore, all the forces have to add up to zero for this to work.\n\
      \nNow, let me switch to the third law, which states that for every action, there\
      \ is an equal and opposite reaction. Here I am standing; I weigh one body mass\
      \ and am being pulled down by gravity at a rate of 9.8 meters per second squared\u2014\
      let's call it 10 for simplicity. This force of gravity is always acting on me,\
      \ and while I\u2019m being pulled down by that force, I'm not moving. This means\
      \ there must be something else pushing back with exactly the same force, which\
      \ is the ground. The ground is a very useful object as it allows us to accomplish\
      \ most of our goals.\n\nAs I push into the ground with mass times gravity as\
      \ the action, the ground pushes back with an equal force in the opposite direction.\
      \ If I decide to exert more force into the ground than gravity is pulling on\
      \ me, I can perform an action as extreme as jumping. So, I push off the ground\
      \ with force greater than my weight, becoming briefly airborne before gravity\
      \ pulls me back down. This concept is important in many contexts.\n\nI need\
      \ to speed up here. Now that we've established that, let's revisit the idea\
      \ of simple spheroids, such as brightly colored juggling balls. When conducting\
      \ empirical studies and measurements, you always need to make assumptions. You\
      \ have to assume that your senses aren\u2019t deceiving you and that the researchers\
      \ of any papers you've read aren't lying or falsifying their data. Each time\
      \ you make an assumption, you gain a little more predictive power.\n\nFor example,\
      \ if I\u2019m trying to measure my body moving through space, I know I\u2019\
      m composed of flexible material and that the distance between my elbow and wrist\
      \ changes slightly. However, if I assume that my body consists of rigid parts\
      \ that don\u2019t change length, my calculations will become easier. I only\
      \ need to measure the angles between these parts, rather than the lengths.\n\
      \nThe only measurement you can make without making assumptions is that you are\
      \ having a conscious experience at this moment, but that isn\u2019t very useful\
      \ in this context. This brings us back to the conservation of energy, which\
      \ is a powerful and useful assumption and essential for understanding our research\
      \ goals.\n\nIf my goal is to understand aspects like standing posture or locomotion,\
      \ there are many dimensions to these questions I cannot measure empirically.\
      \ I lack the technology to measure the firing in my cerebellum or the stretch\
      \ forces in my muscles. However, I can measure aspects like the position of\
      \ my body using a motion capture system\u2014a setup I created in my house,\
      \ measuring my position 33 times per second.\n\nBy utilizing measurable aspects\
      \ and making certain assumptions about energy conservation, I can begin to understand\
      \ the various elements involved. When conducting a mechanical analysis of a\
      \ person, it is crucial to consider the relevant forms of energy related to\
      \ the task at hand. In this portion of the class, we will focus on movement.\
      \ We aren't examining perception or vision, allowing us to concentrate on the\
      \ physical realities of being a significant mass in a world of gravity and physical\
      \ interactions.\n\nThe forms of energy we will chiefly measure and care about\
      \ are potential energy and kinetic energy. The most evident type of potential\
      \ energy is gravitational potential energy. The height above the ground determines\
      \ this potential energy; we define the ground as having a height of zero. The\
      \ gravitational potential energy can be calculated using the formula: mass times\
      \ gravity times height. Here, mass is in kilograms, gravity in meters per second\
      \ squared, and height in meters. The resultant measurement will yield a force\
      \ in Newtons when you perform the calculations. Essentially, potential energy\
      \ measures the force an object would exert if dropped from a height."

    text: "Other forms of potential energy, which we are not going to discuss as much,\
      \ include spring potential energy, which relates to the stretchiness of a spring,\
      \ and chemical potential energy, which is associated with food, bombs, gasoline,\
      \ and similar substances. A lot of the deeper-level biology involves chemical\
      \ potential energy, and that is when you start observing ion charges that do\
      \ not align. This is related to understanding the electrical units; potential\
      \ energy represents a mismatch between the way the world prefers to be and the\
      \ current state of the world. For example, the low-energy state of an object,\
      \ if I weren't holding it, would be on the ground. If I let go, I know how much\
      \ energy will be released upon impact.\n\nKinetic energy, which is a focus in\
      \ physics, is also important to consider. To measure kinetic energy, you use\
      \ the formula KE = 1/2 mv\xB2, where mass is in kilograms and velocity is in\
      \ meters per second. When you do the math, it will yield Newtons since it measures\
      \ force. The amount of kinetic energy an object has just before it hits the\
      \ ground is equal to the potential energy it had before being dropped. Adding\
      \ these energies together provides insight into the parabolic flight of an object\
      \ through space. At the moment it leaves my hand, it has maximum kinetic energy\
      \ and minimum potential energy. As it rises, its kinetic energy decreases while\
      \ potential energy increases until it reaches the apex, where potential energy\
      \ is at its maximum and kinetic energy is at its minimum, briefly reaching zero\
      \ velocity before descending back.\n\nSo, when the object returns, just before\
      \ it hits the ground again, it will possess the same amount of kinetic energy\
      \ as when it started. This illustrates the energy trade-off between kinetic\
      \ and potential energy. When I discussed transduction, such as for vision or\
      \ sensation, we were talking about the transfer of energy from one form\u2014\
      like light measured in candelas\u2014into another form, like the pattern of\
      \ neural activity, which is measured through voltages and ion mismatches. There\u2019\
      s much that\u2019s not quantifiable in that conversion, yet physics suggests\
      \ that if you could count every ion and quantum of energy, the mathematics would\
      \ closely resemble the physics of simple ballistic motion, similar to how kinetic\
      \ and potential energy function.\n\nAdditionally, I could flap my wings as a\
      \ bird to generate lift against gravity. If I were using a pogo stick and compressed\
      \ it before releasing it, it would harness spring potential energy when it hits\
      \ the ground and could bounce. Assuming rigid body physics, the conservation\
      \ of kinetic and potential energy will manifest as a conservative trade-off.\n\
      \nNow, we get to my favorite part, which I will only briefly touch on today\
      \ and discuss in depth next time: the concept of the center of mass. The center\
      \ of mass is a term in physics you may have encountered, particularly in sports,\
      \ gymnastics, and balance-related activities. It represents the average position\
      \ of all parts of an object. For example, if I were to cut a tube into 1 cm\
      \ sections and take their positions relative to a chosen zero point, averaging\
      \ those would locate the center of mass in the middle of the tube.\n\nWhen supporting\
      \ an object, one typically supports its center of mass. If I were to hold it\
      \ at one end, the center of mass would fall, and it wouldn\u2019t remain balanced\
      \ in my hand. For instance, if I add ankle weights\u2014like the ones I found\
      \ near my home\u2014they would change the distribution of mass within the object,\
      \ thus shifting the center of mass. To support the entire system, one must account\
      \ for this shift.\n\nWe could determine the weight of this system by measuring\
      \ the distance from the balance point to the center of the stick, or where it\
      \ would balance if it were symmetrically oriented. Although I don\u2019t wish\
      \ to do that, it\u2019s feasible. The concept of balance is crucial as it relates\
      \ to the center of mass and the base of support, a topic we will discuss extensively.\n\
      \nFinally, we touched on reductionist approaches in scientific studies, which\
      \ aim to narrow down complex problems. Instead of trying to measure the entirety\
      \ of a system, you might focus on a single joint or limb while maintaining the\
      \ understanding of the larger system\u2019s motion. However, even with such\
      \ a reduction, a simplified model remains complex, consisting of multiple joints\
      \ providing various degrees of freedom. This will aid in defining the position\
      \ of this kinematic object."

    text: "Space requires a lot of different numbers, and that is going to be sort\
      \ of hard to deal with. The other approach is to simplify the system you are\
      \ looking at into a massive oversimplification and try to do that in such a\
      \ way that still allows you to say things about the system as a whole. Essentially,\
      \ that is the idea of the center of mass. Rather than thinking about this whole\
      \ complex thing with all the joints, muscles, and biological realities going\
      \ on, we can condense it down into a simplified system. \n\nThis is something\
      \ I created some years ago. This image shows a guy doing a handstand, a French\
      \ parkour athlete named Simonster, and the X here represents his full body center\
      \ of mass, which is measured as the weighted sum of each of these body segments.\
      \ So, for example, you consider the forearm, upper arm, head, chest, and legs.\
      \ You take the average of all those positions, weighted by the mass of each\
      \ object. The forearm weighs a lot less than the legs, for instance. This is\
      \ the position you get, and if you measure the limits of the base of support\
      \ as the distance between the tips of his fingers and the heel of his hand,\
      \ those are the places where you can exert force into the ground. The center\
      \ of mass always stays within that space, which means that even though there\u2019\
      s a lot going on biologically, from a physics perspective, you can define the\
      \ task of balance using these highly simplified models of the body. This takes\
      \ the entire complexity of a human person and reduces it to a singular point\
      \ mass. This representation could be in two dimensions, but it could also be\
      \ in three dimensions. \n\nWe have now simplified the world down to a place\
      \ that starts to feel more tractable. I can handle this many numbers; I can\
      \ kind of handle this many numbers but not really. By the way, if you refer\
      \ to the notes and click on the link, there is a collection of similar animations\
      \ that I created. We will discuss them more later.\n\nYou can reduce this complex\
      \ object of a human down to a singular point mass. Physics has informed us\u2014\
      I'm not completely certain, but I believe it is the finite element theorem or\
      \ something like that\u2014which basically states that things you say about\
      \ the center of mass of a system are true to some extent about all the objects\
      \ in that system. Thus, discussing the center of mass of a person is a valid\
      \ approximation of what the full picture would be if I were measuring every\
      \ single part of their body at the same time. However, you will obviously lose\
      \ a lot of information. When boiling down an individual\u2019s entire body to\
      \ this singular mass, I can no longer accurately comment on things like joint\
      \ angles or the forces at the elbow. However, I can determine whether or not\
      \ they are in a stable or unstable regime, and I can measure what happens at\
      \ the physics level when they shift their hands from one position to another.\
      \ This allows me to infer what some of these movements actually mean.\n\nFor\
      \ example, without this sort of center of mass analysis, it might be hard to\
      \ explain why his arm is out there. You might not have much to say about that,\
      \ but when viewing it through this lens, it becomes easy to understand. He sticks\
      \ his arm out so that his center of mass remains aligned. If I move my arm and\
      \ leg as shown, the average keeps my body over my foot. I can do this, but I\
      \ can't do that. Anyway, you'll figure it out. I will provide visual representations\
      \ of this once you get the numbers next week.\n\nYou might ask how we take these\
      \ measurements and obtain these numbers, like where to draw the segment center\
      \ of mass for his torso or what percentage of body weight the forearm is. Well,\
      \ it turns out we have lookup tables for this; this is called anthropometry.\
      \ These particular lookup tables come from a gentleman named David Winter, and\
      \ this is taken from a textbook of his from around 1995. It shows these measurements\
      \ of the shoulder as 0.129 times body height. There are also lookup tables for\
      \ these body segments. For instance, the forearm is defined as the distance\
      \ between the elbow axis and the styloid process, which is 0.028 times body\
      \ mass, and the center of mass is 36% of the weight from the proximal joint,\
      \ the one towards the middle, to the distal joint, the one that\u2019s farther\
      \ away. If you add these two numbers together, they equal one. Thus, you can\
      \ use these numbers to calculate these values.\n\nThese figures are basically\
      \ statistics based on research that involved segmenting bodies of deceased individuals,\
      \ specifically for Air Force research, I believe. Most were older men; however,\
      \ there are now newer tables that include individuals of different ages and\
      \ genders. Ultimately, it doesn't significantly matter, as there might be slight\
      \ differences\u2014 like women having a lower center of mass than men. But for\
      \ the levels of analysis we typically look at regarding this type of physics,\
      \ the differences between these estimates for various categories of humans fall\
      \ below the precision level of our measurements in most cases. Therefore, I\
      \ tend to keep using these numbers since they are readily available.\n\nIf you\
      \ look up anthropometry tables, you will find plenty of new research about how\
      \ they studied athletic and non-athletic individuals, along with a variety of\
      \ other factors. And that\u2019s great for them. Now, speaking of pendulums,\
      \ they are my favorite topic, and we will discuss them next week, along with\
      \ balance. We will also talk about projective geometry, which relates to how\
      \ cameras and vision operate. Although this is focused on light rather than\
      \ physics, it employs the same kind of concept: you project things.\n\nThat\
      \ was a lot, and I hope you gained something from it. It will not be on the\
      \ test; there is no test. It\u2019s much more about internalizing it, conceptualizing\
      \ it, and thinking about the concepts rather than the details. It\u2019s better\
      \ to think about how you would recreate this story when explaining it to someone\
      \ else rather than trying to memorize specific points of what I said. Notice\
      \ a lot of it was reconstructed from first principles, and being able to do\
      \ that is useful\u2014so try telling the story to someone else."

- full_transcript: okay hello everybody and welcome to Wednesday um so today is a
    very special day um because today we&amp;#39;re going to do some data collection
    which is always a very exciting time in any scientist&amp;#39;s life when you
    you you get some numbers you take some recordings and then often times you spend
    the next like while uh analyzing that data so how it goes matters a lot this is
    not a particularly High uh high stakes situation but yeah it&amp;#39;ll be fun
    so we&amp;#39;re going to do I&amp;#39;m going to try to like finish up what I
    was talking about last time and then I&amp;#39;m going to set up the cameras and
    uh do a quick recording do a couple of quick recordings with the free moap softare
    which I made with my lab over the past six years or so um and then if if all goes
    well it should pop something out that&amp;#39;s worth looking at today um and
    then I will do some additional fiddling with it and I either have something to
    say about that on Monday or wait and give myself an extra bit of time and talk
    about that on Wednesday um so if you&amp;#39;re not yeah your job is mostly to
    just sit and listen and try not to fall asleep but if you fall asleep I understand
    you&amp;#39;re you got a lot going on um so Behold a human person it is roughly
    speaking this shape see uh this is a complicated shap but it&amp;#39;s not nearly
    as complicated as this weird object um but if we needed to because we are finite
    beings with finite technology in finite time if we wanted to study this complicated
    object this the desidera of our research being to understand how humans move through
    the world eight um you have to make simplifications you have to make assumptions
    you have to do things like that and so last time I talked about can I do this
    that works so last time I talked about my personal favorite uh oversimplification
    of a complex physical object which is to take that object and reduce it down to
    a single point mass that we call the center of Mass center of mass we often hear
    it called like center of gravity um which in that term in that meaning uh gravity
    is sort of meant in like the old school sense of like density uh because density
    and mass are kind of the same thing in some conceptions um but the the beauty
    of the center mass is that it&amp;#39;s a rather simple thing um the center of
    mass is the the concept of Center Mass is the thing that&amp;#39;s the intuition
    that says that if I want to balance this stick on my finger I put my finger under
    two fingers under the midpoint of the the Total distribution of Mass on the thing
    and it balances there because there&amp;#39;s the same amount of pull on this
    side as there is on that side and if it&amp;#39;s a symmetric object the center
    of mass corresponds to the geometric center of the object itself if it is non
    that&amp;#39;s the wrong direction oh I did that whoops um uh what am I trying
    to do I&amp;#39;m trying to do that if the weight is non-symmetrically um so linguistically
    it we tend to like interchange mass and weight language wise um in imperial units
    we actually don&amp;#39;t have a dedicated measure for Mass we just use pounds
    which is actually a measure of weight weight is a measure of force it&amp;#39;s
    like how much force am I putting into the ground so if you assume that gravity
    isn&amp;#39;t changing mass and weight are interchangeable but just because I
    spent like an hour and a half last week for on Monday talking about SI units I
    should specify that when I say weight I typically mean mass in vice versa uh but
    until we go to the Moon that won&amp;#39;t be a problem anyways Center of mass
    when the weight is non the mass is non uniformly distributed the center of mass
    is not going to be the same as the geometric center of the object but the same
    basic idea maintains like there is as much mass on this side of the base of support
    which is this as there is on that side and so the center of mass of the thing
    is right around here and so if I wanted to hold this object off of the ground
    sta I I need the base of support to be under the center of mass of the object
    itself if I put the center of base of support outside of the center of mass it&amp;#39;ll
    fall in that direction which is not particularly mind-blowing but it is an app
    description of what balance is at a very s of low level of physics um have a let
    make sure we have enough time to sort of say all the things I want to say uh should
    be fine um so last time we also talked about any balls here I didn&amp;#39;t bring
    me um when an object is flying through the air it has this nice ballistic trajectory
    which is caused by the transduction and exchange between kinetic and potential
    energy in a gravity well and there&amp;#39;s MGH is potential energy 1 12 mv^
    s is kinetic energy and even though this object is complicated in its form the
    trajectory that it takes in the air is exactly the same as it would be if if I
    was throwing an equivalent mass in a like if if this if you condense this down
    to like a single lead sphere and I toss it in the air it would follow the same
    trajectory if I spin it it spins around its Center of mass because it&amp;#39;s
    in a when it&amp;#39;s not when it doesn&amp;#39;t have anything to push off against
    you don&amp;#39;t have any there&amp;#39;s nothing to react there no re no re
    no reaction force to push you in any direction things balance out and you get
    sort of simple predictable physical behavior um we also talked very briefly about
    one of my favorite things which is pendul pendulums pendulums pendul which this
    is an example of a pendulum you&amp;#39;ve seen them in various places of your
    life and it&amp;#39;s basically a mass hanging below a standard pendulum is a
    mass hanging below a pivot point and if without you know if you pull it back and
    then let it go it&amp;#39;ll swing back and forth for quite some time until friction
    bleeds off enough energy that it will eventually slow down and the reason for
    that sort of conservative motion is the same kind of transduction between potential
    and kinetic energy so if you imagine that&amp;#39;s a pivot point that&amp;#39;s
    the the Bob the mass of the pendulum let&amp;#39;s assume that this string doesn&amp;#39;t
    weigh anything or at the very least it weighs much much much less than this if
    we wanted to we could also just imagine that if it&amp;#39;s shaped if this is
    the shape you know the center of mass of the thing is still going to be definable
    mathematically in some place there um but here it is up here and then we let it
    go it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s up here at rest so it&amp;#39;s kinetic energy equals
    zero and its potential energy is at let&amp;#39;s just say it&amp;#39;s Max and
    then so we let it go and it drops and then it gets to this point here where it&amp;#39;s
    at the lowest point of its swing and at that point its potential energy is at
    its minimum because it&amp;#39;s the lowest it&amp;#39;s going to get you could
    even say the potential energy is zero if you want to talk about it that way um
    but its kinetic energy is going to be its maximum it&amp;#39;s going to be moving
    the fastest it&amp;#39;s going to move here after you drop it and then it&amp;#39;s
    going to be moving so fast that it will have moment momentum because of that whole
    inertia thing that first law that will carry it up the other side of the Swing
    until it gets here and then again it will briefly pause kinetic velocity zero
    kinetic energy zero kinetic energy zero potential energy Max um and then it will
    then the same process repeats in reverse and as long as there&amp;#39;s no way
    place that the energy can go it will continue like that forever in reality there&amp;#39;s
    always going to be things like friction on points like this there&amp;#39;s always
    going to be things like air resistance that will be bleeding off some of the energy
    so it will eventually if we if we plot it over time and we plot let&amp;#39;s
    say this is the angle here Theta we want and we drop it from here it&amp;#39;ll
    go like this and then it will slowly we call that damping out if it was a ideal
    system this would just be like a nice sine wave forever but because there&amp;#39;s
    going to be some bleed due to friction this will be the nice trajectory there
    so that is a this is what a a standard hanging pendulum and look at it go pendula
    are very very very very important in the history of science they are sort of part
    of almost every important measurement in history um like gravitational constants
    you know Electro kolum Force um apparently there was a time when they used to
    use the period of a pendulum to do prospecting for iron ore because you can measure
    the D like the the period of a pendulum very very accurately and it&amp;#39;s
    going to be defined by the density it&amp;#39;s like the gravitational constant
    the gravitational force is a part of that uh equation of motion so apparently
    they would just like move these very very very precise pendula over parts of the
    ground where they thought there might be iron ore and then if they measured a
    change in the period that&amp;#39;s an that&amp;#39;s a reason to believe that
    there&amp;#39;s a higher density in the column between you and the center of the
    earth this is I read about this in a book I had a hard time validating verifying
    that information but nonetheless it&amp;#39;s very it&amp;#39;s a pendula pendulums
    very good stuff um pendulums are also a nice example of like that periodic motion
    I mentioned briefly last time how we think about time there&amp;#39;s like the
    the there&amp;#39;s like stopwatch time which always counts up but then there&amp;#39;s
    kind of like wall clock time that resets every so often and with something like
    an oscillator like this you sort of you&amp;#39;re thinking in that phasic sort
    of like time you know goes from zero to some Maximum and then it like resets and
    then that&amp;#39;s we call that a full cycle many many parts of biology ology
    have this kind of like phasic behavior um a lot of my research historically has
    been on Locomotion and that has a lot of pendulums in it um the main one that
    you would think about with the pendulum is like The Swinging leg um but there&amp;#39;s
    another much more dramatic and Central pendulum which is the inverted pendulum
    of your sort of standing body so this is a pendulum hanging from a a central Pivot
    Point um but but you could lift this thing up until it&amp;#39;s all the way on
    top and then have it be up here as an inverted pendulum and at this place uh so
    at the bottom here this is a stable point because if we just let it run this is
    where it will wind up this is in the language of dynamical systems um this is
    called an unstable point because technically speaking if you placed this here
    precisely at you know the angle of deflection equals zero this would stay it&amp;#39;s
    it would sort of stand up in the same way that this marker stands up on the desk
    um but the reality but because this is an unstable point a any perturbation from
    to the left or the right is going to cause it like if you if this is not perfectly
    straight if it&amp;#39;s a little bit off to the right right then gravity is going
    to pull it down and then it&amp;#39;s going to keep pulling it down until it falls
    down there so you can balance a a p so you can hang a pendulum and it&amp;#39;s
    passively stable gravity does all the work for you you don&amp;#39;t have to worry
    about it um if you have if the pendulum has if the base of support has extent
    if it&amp;#39;s nonzero base of support you can balance it happily on a flat surface
    and it will also stay there passively forever um but if it&amp;#39;s if it&amp;#39;s
    not then you can balance it you then the only way that you can balance it upright
    is if you are actively controlling it so this is the classic like boom broom trick
    where you can just like balance something on your hand and you can do it because
    I&amp;#39;m moving around the base of support to make sure that the that the whole
    thing never Falls over but I can&amp;#39;t so this is all by way of preamble to
    the recordings we&amp;#39;re about to do so if you think about in some idealized
    pendulum and this is the center of Mass on top of it uh remember we&amp;#39;re
    spending a lot of time thinking about Force equals mass time acceleration um where
    this is the mass which we&amp;#39;re assuming the mass doesn&amp;#39;t change
    so we can sort of assume that Force equals acceleration some approximation um
    and so if you&amp;#39;re you know in the idealized form you manag to standing
    up here if the projection of the center of mass onto the floor if the distance
    from that projection from this infimal base of support is zero then it&amp;#39;ll
    be happily standing ight forever um if instead we&amp;#39;re off by a little bit
    and the projection of the center of mass has a distance here from the base of
    support then in a very intuitive sense that gravity pulls things down Gravely
    pulling like that and then this distance there will be sort of P pushing the object
    away so that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s unstable because any deflection from zero
    and it will start to fall and the farther that it falls the more it gets pushed
    away so it&amp;#39;ll be accelerating away from that sort of stable Point um and
    so if I&amp;#39;m if you&amp;#39;re supporting it like the broom then you can
    make you can fix that by moving around the base of support on the ground um but
    if you yourself are the pendulum in question and you are you know imagine my center
    of mass is here and I&amp;#39;m standing on my one little leg if I I can um the
    only way that I can really have any control over where my body is is by the forces
    that I&amp;#39;m putting into the ground to my foot um so if we now imagine that&amp;#39;s
    me that&amp;#39;s my center of mass this joint here is the only place that I can
    push into the ground and so if I&amp;#39;m leaning a little bit too far forward
    I can push with my toe and push myself back if I&amp;#39;m lean a little too far
    back I can push with my heel not really I can I can lean forward I can do something
    to try to like change the forces to push myself in that direction but in in general
    if I&amp;#39;m not if I don&amp;#39;t have monkey feet or grippers on my on the
    ground I can only really push so that means that my center of mass has to stay
    within this base of support range in order for me to be able to maintain standing
    posture without doing something dramatic like taking a step that&amp;#39;s usually
    what we can do so if we&amp;#39;re assuming that the task is to stand upright
    without taking a step the goal condition there is the center of mass stays within
    the base of support so that I can sort of move move around the force I&amp;#39;m
    pushing into the ground and sort of push my body back and forth to where it needs
    to go so that is balance and standing posture in a nutshell um all of this that
    we&amp;#39;re doing here it falls under the category of biomechanics anytime you
    hear anyone talking about like forces and mechanics and Newton&amp;#39;s laws
    and centers of mass and joints and cors and stuff like that you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re
    hearing someone talk about biomechanics um but if you think about sort of like
    zoom out a little bit from those low-level physics and start thinking instead
    about the you know start thinking about the this physical object now as a biological
    system with a biological system with muscles and neurons and sensory systems and
    stuff like that um you can start trying to ask the questions from the sort of
    neuroscience perspective of how does all of that sort of play out in a a human
    person with things like joints and muscles and stuff like that so how do I if
    I&amp;#39;m if I&amp;#39;m because we&amp;#39;re very very good at standing up
    this body configuration with the two feet and the arms that are that are off the
    ground this is wild in the animal kingdom this is a wild way to be musculos skeletally
    um pretty much all other mammals are quadrip heads um the only other bipeds out
    there are birds and most of them fly um the ground birds are arguably better bipeds
    than we are because they have like 450 million years of evolution on us so uh
    good for them but generally speaking like for Animals as big as we are to to support
    your entire body weight of off the ground with Just 2 feet is wacky it&amp;#39;s
    like unpress ented there we really there&amp;#39;s no other animals at least in
    the Maman Kingdom that have um bipedal locomotion kangaroos are a good example
    but they they can&amp;#39;t really walk on two legs when they&amp;#39;re when
    they&amp;#39;re moving they can bounce on two legs but when they&amp;#39;re when
    they&amp;#39;re in place they sort of you know crawl around on four feet and they
    use their tails um animals like uh like bears and apes and stuff like that can
    walk on two feet but they tend to be they&amp;#39;re knuckle Walkers um we are
    I believe I&amp;#39;m always like waiting to be find a counter example but at
    this point I should probably just accept that there aren&amp;#39;t any uh we&amp;#39;re
    like the only obligate bipeds in the Maman Kingdom where obligate bipad means
    like we really don&amp;#39;t have like another option here like we it&amp;#39;s
    bip or nothing um and we are also as far as they can figure out the only animal
    that has two of the main limbs of the sort of tetrapod this is tetrapod pod shape
    head two limbs on top two limbs on bottom and and a spine um we the only ones
    that have really well adapted upper limbs that have nothing to do with Locomotion
    um even ground Birds they have wings but they tend to kind of suck as appendages
    go um but we really we gave up a lot to have these like grabbing objects um and
    the cost was that we had now have to do this sort of gymnastics routine every
    time we want to get from point A to point B so thinking about this um like the
    neural bases of bipedalism and standing posture is one of those things that feels
    like kind of like a baser level of behavior than we tend to think about when we&amp;#39;re
    thinking about the Majesty of human you know neuroscience and biology um but it&amp;#39;s
    really fundamental and it&amp;#39;s really core to like what we are as organisms
    and creatures so I think it&amp;#39;s worth consideration here and and yeah yeah
    and so with that I think we can start transitioning towards like the data collection
    part of this so if we assume now that we all have the shared desire to understand
    how we weird bipedal humans manage to stand as effectively as we do stand upright
    and walk around as effectively as we do um we can start now trying to think of
    this as empirical scientists and start asking the question of if the if that is
    if the desired outcome the desera of our research Endeavors is to understand the
    neural bases of let&amp;#39;s say just for Simplicity sake standing posture what
    are the measurements that we can take and what are the analyses that we can do
    and that that would give us insight into the underpinnings of that behavior um
    and there&amp;#39;s lot of options um but we&amp;#39;re going to do some simplified
    not some it&amp;#39;s not even all that simplified but we&amp;#39;re going to
    take um a full body perspective like you could go in and say oh well I want to
    figure out the sensitivity like how do we detect our lean angle like is it the
    vestibular organs in our inner ear is it the pressure under our foot is it the
    is it the the the proprioceptive forces and our ankles how can we measure the
    sensitivities of those things how can we sort of understand those circuits what
    are some other animals we can look at and you can do the kind of like the classic
    reductive um like biological stuff and start looking at like the the properties
    of of the muscles and we can you know cut up some cavers and see what&amp;#39;s
    the density of of you know somata sensory organs in the bottom of the feet we
    can do that kind of like like zooming in on one part of the task um but necessarily
    doing that will leave out the actual behavior that we care about and what what
    we would would call the ecologically valid Behavior behavior of the organism in
    question performing the task that we care about in the real world or something
    close to the real world that you know is the if we assume we care about standing
    posture then we care about standing posture in the real world we don&amp;#39;t
    care about standing posture in the lab in some weird artificial environment that
    we concocted so that we could have something that we could study um we might have
    to use that to be able to make any progress but secretly we we will feel a little
    bit sad because we will know that we have created an artificial representation
    of the thing in question and we are not actually studying the thing itself um
    so with that said yeah uh I won&amp;#39;t go I won&amp;#39;t do the whole Biz
    about this but also jumping exists we&amp;#39;re going to course I&amp;#39;m jumping
    too jumping is kind of like this except instead of like leaning you&amp;#39;re
    you&amp;#39;re putting Force into the ground and if you put more Force into the
    ground then you weigh you&amp;#39;ll leave the ground until you have bled off
    that additional energy and then you&amp;#39;ll come back down and do something
    roughly equivalent to that uh yeah um yeah okay how do you feel about that so
    far emotionally prepared for what is to come great [Applause] so in a little bit
    here I have an hour and hour to go which there would be enough time uh spoiler
    alert I&amp;#39;m going to I&amp;#39;m going to set up some cameras and those
    cameras are going to allow us to record um full body 3D kinematic data of a human
    person standing in space this human person is me I would love to do a thing where
    we like record you guys and do that but like it just the time doesn&amp;#39;t
    really work out um and so this weird confguration of cheap cameras and free software
    will will give us an approximation of my body uh at 30 frames per second down
    to some level of precision um at the centimeter scale of precision for my joints
    and the approximation will be roughly equivalent to this it will tell me roughly
    where my head was where each body segment was where each joint was and this will
    be kind of like the this is the data model that will come out of it um and this
    is where I&amp;#39;m going to start thinking as we go uh and I&amp;#39;m going
    to record myself doing a couple of behaviors so the first thing I&amp;#39;m going
    to do is calibrate because I have to do that and I&amp;#39;ll tell you about talk
    about that as it goes um then I&amp;#39;m going to do a standing task so I&amp;#39;m
    going to stand on two feet then I&amp;#39;m going to stand on one foot and then
    I&amp;#39;m going to stand on the other foot and then we&amp;#39;re going to probably
    I&amp;#39;ll ask someone to pull out a timer we do like 20 30 seconds of standing
    in each each one so this will be recording one this will be recording two uh sorry
    0 1 and then two I&amp;#39;m going to do the same thing doing this different than
    I&amp;#39;ve done the past years but I&amp;#39;m going to do the same thing except
    now I&amp;#39;m going to do the same thing while holding on to a chair so I&amp;#39;ll
    like so I&amp;#39;ll start out doing just like freestanding and then next time
    I&amp;#39;ll like lean over and like have my hand on the desk and sort of do the
    same kinds of tasks um then after that I&amp;#39;m going to do I&amp;#39;m going
    to take a couple big jumps just jump standing jump as high as I can jump uh and
    then we&amp;#39;ll do another one where I&amp;#39;ll do like I&amp;#39;ll jump
    in place for like 30 seconds and then at that point that&amp;#39;ll be enough
    recordings um so that yeah so we&amp;#39;re going to so this will be so we&amp;#39;ll
    get 1 2 3 four five total recordings which should process in the moment depending
    on how fast how long it takes set up I may or may not truncate the processing
    so that we can get through them all um but the your task as you&amp;#39;re watching
    the the show um is just kind of think about these behaviors and think about them
    relative to the kind of the the biomechanic Center of mass types of uh of conversations
    we&amp;#39;ve been having so far and just make some predictions about what these
    data will look like um and you could think about it at like the full joint level
    like you know down to the level of like knees and ankles and shoulders and stuff
    like that um but that can be a little overwhelming so I would also recommend thinking
    about it just in terms of like if you boiled this whole thing down to just a ground
    plane a foot and a leg and then a center of mass what would you expect to see
    like what&amp;#39;s going to be the difference between like standing on two legs
    versus standing on one leg what&amp;#39;s gonna be the difference between standing
    on one leg free versus standing one leg while like leaning on a table uh what&amp;#39;s
    it going to look like when I take a big jump like what&amp;#39;s it going to look
    like when I take a bunch of jumps um and yeah think about it oo make some predictions
    uh because there&amp;#39;s your ability to make predictions about what this is
    going to go is how you know that you&amp;#39;re operating within a theoretical
    framework they&amp;#39;re thinking about there is an assumption that I am making
    that boiling down the this hyper complex object into a singular 3D Point Mass
    and and and saying I we&amp;#39;ll be able to say things about that we&amp;#39;ll
    be able to predict the motion of that point mass and say things about that point
    mass that will tell us things about that the global organism um that&amp;#39;s
    a that&amp;#39;s a theoretical framework that&amp;#39;s a strong bold claim um
    but we&amp;#39;re going to operate within that space and yeah I&amp;#39;m going
    to try to do this without crashing my computer too uh which is always fun so great
    has anybody here worked anywhere near motion capture before any like physical
    therapy or anything like that no yeah so it&amp;#39;s one of these things where
    motion capture like mostly where you will have seen it will be like behind the
    scenes and of movies and video games and stuff like that um you know a lot of
    like Lord of the Rings stuff of Golem and smile run running around um all right
    uh but it has been around and used to study human movement for quite some time
    um arguably video like the invention of video uh was technically what am I doing
    here that I got that I have this this yes um and then this so the original like
    video was created to study horses in motion based off a a barbat uh from Vanderbilt
    the guy like the robber bearing um about whether or not horses ever was there
    was ever a point in their Gallop with they at all fourt off the ground so you&amp;#39;ve
    probably seen the picture of like this like a bunch of horses old timey video
    um basically to solve that bet uh Vanderbilt commissioned a photographer to like
    take a bunch of sequential videos of pictures of a horse in full gallop and was
    able to show that there is in fact a phase where they&amp;#39;re all off the ground
    where the feet are all off the ground um but in since then motion capture has
    been used in the study of human movement and clinical stuff um for as long as
    we&amp;#39;ve been doing that what am I doing doing this okay uh but also traditionally
    it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not a very common thing to do because it&amp;#39;s very
    very expensive um the motion capture lab I have in Richards invol has like A4
    million dollar worth of motion capture equipment in it and it&amp;#39;s in a a
    room that was specifically built for the purpose of doing motion capture and it&amp;#39;s
    you know it&amp;#39;s a very good system it&amp;#39;s very very precise but it&amp;#39;s
    also a huge pain it to use and it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s expensive so the
    the you know there&amp;#39;s the the number of people out there who are studying
    human movement is much much larger than the number of people can who can afford
    motion capture so that was kind of a part of the motivation that I had for making
    this strange system um was basically realizing around 2017 when a software came
    out called uh open pose that used convolutional neural networks to basically draw
    a stick figure on a person in a video and I saw that and then sometime later realized
    that that capacity to basically draw like a 2d skeleton estimate on a person in
    a scene was kind of enough to build a motion capture system out of um and then
    you know that was sort of an idea that I had and sort of the thought was yeah
    that&amp;#39;s a cool idea but like I don&amp;#39;t know how to write code and
    that seems like way too much work so I guess I&amp;#39;ll never do it and then
    three years later Co hit and I lost access to my lab for an undef period of time
    and I also lost faith in the academic system uh pretty much entirely and started
    like rethinking the idea that using I&amp;#39;m going to have to unplug this camera
    now um sure I&amp;#39;ll turn you off later um yeah I I kind of I started to really
    doubt the core principle of science which is that the best thing that we can do
    as scientist is to publish papers in esoteric journals that exploit us for profit
    um and started thinking about like you know is this Behavior actually making the
    world a better place and started had the uncomfortable realization that like I
    don&amp;#39;t really think it does like I think it&amp;#39;s a good thing to do
    I think that you know scientists are generally trying to like improve the world
    um but we&amp;#39;re trapped in these systems of of communication that just like
    it just doesn&amp;#39;t serve like it it made sense in the 1800s it just doesn&amp;#39;t
    make sense now so I personally transitioned away from publishing papers and journals
    and towards using the skills and understandings that I have from my sort of history
    of scientific research to build tools that people can actually use in their real
    lives uh so this is one of them um so real quick if you want to look it up Freo
    cap just Google Freo cap you&amp;#39;ll find it freeo cap it&amp;#39;s pretty
    oh I&amp;#39;m not on the internet am I on the internet I am on the internet yeah
    um hey look people make videos about me uh but yeah you can look it up it was
    a whole it&amp;#39;s been a whole process um and let&amp;#39;s get to it so so
    free mo cap stands for free motion capture it is a markless motion capture system
    the majority of like traditional motion capture you wind up you wear the spandex
    with the suits and the reflective dots this is markerless so the idea is to use
    sort of like the modern sort of uh what&amp;#39;s the word the the arising technology
    of just like computer vision and sort of like the wacky stuff we can do with that
    to to play the role that the markers used to play in traditional motion capture
    systems um let&amp;#39;s talk a little bit more what that means I&amp;#39;m actually
    doing it um just go uh the hardest part of making this process the most sophisticated
    part of The Code by by a mile is the part that connects to the cameras um maybe
    it shouldn&amp;#39;t have been as surprising do this yeah I think that makes sense
    um so everything is Skelly skelly&amp;#39;s the logo it&amp;#39;s like a skeleton
    you see it&amp;#39;s like you know kind of how it works uh my personal Journey
    as a researcher I was a philosopher I got a bachelor degree in philosophy then
    I started doing more perceptual motor neuroscience and kind of like was studying
    vision from like a vision science perspective um and was feeling not it felt insufficient
    it felt like incomplete and it wasn&amp;#39;t until I started digging into I started
    like found my way into some of the more biomechanics approach to movement um that
    because I was studying visually guided Locomotion in an environment that really
    didn&amp;#39;t have any consideration of like the physics of being an object moving
    through space um and when I started reading the biomechanics papers was when it
    a lot of things started to click for me and those papers had a bunch of skeletons
    in it calm it down guys um and that&amp;#39;s why there&amp;#39;s skeletons everywhere
    just because it&amp;#39;s sort of like this it&amp;#39;s like kind of a joke that
    I studi Neuroscience from the perspective of a skeleton because that&amp;#39;s
    like physics wise it&amp;#39;s mostly skeleton the neural components are really
    not not really Newton doesn&amp;#39;t really notice the Neuroscience parts of
    it he mostly notices the skeleton anyway anyway um so so this is the latest form
    of the software um actually it&amp;#39;s not uh the the main so the current stage
    of development of free moap is that the the the core software is a little bit
    behind the development side of it so we&amp;#39;re using the this camera stuff
    it&amp;#39;s very slow for some reason why are we so slow okay there we go oh
    right I have to turn you off over here okay apologies to oh I guess we can do
    that so uh turn you off okay there you go um let me shut you down me again so
    this is one of those places where like all the stuff streaming by is where all
    the work went and then the outside is quite simple in comparison um reasonably
    confident that this will work but anytime oh wait that&amp;#39;s still okay hopefully
    that should work better we can hope yeah so as a scientific tool um motion capture
    is in the very uh crowded space of being a camera based research tool so the environmental
    energy that we are encoding and recording in this case will be light so light
    bounces off of me bounces goes through the lens of the camera gets absorbed by
    the camera sensor which is just a little rectangular silicone wafer silicon wafer
    whatever whichever one of those is accurate um and yeah and then we will be recording
    the we will be pulling samples from a light cone from three different locations
    in space um 30 times per second uh and there&amp;#39;s been a lot like a lot a
    lot like years of my life has been spent uh making sure that the videos that get
    recorded from these cameras are uh synchronous so as these cameras are pulling
    as each camera is sort of pulling uh you know frames from its field of view um
    there&amp;#39;s a lot of code under the hood that&amp;#39;s making sure that each
    camera is pulling at close to the same time as the others as possible so we&amp;#39;re
    pulling syn Eyes videos so we talked about the mentioned last time the sort of
    the concept of like spatio temporal calibration to in recording and sort of that
    just like the spatial components and the temporal components great the temporal
    components here are handled by the software so we are going to assume that all
    the the samples from each camera are synchronized in time to some approximation
    um so the second part of that is the spatial so let&amp;#39;s see so those are
    all rotated are they rotated the same way they are which is counterclockwise I
    think that should work did I get that right I got it backwards it&amp;#39;s always
    backwards yeah we here okay good um yeah great so it&amp;#39;s not using the space
    particularly well but don&amp;#39;t worry about that so this is so now I&amp;#39;m
    going to point the cameras so I&amp;#39;m going to stand right here and so I&amp;#39;m
    going to try to point the cameras that they can all get a good view of that spot
    all right oh I have that one that&amp;#39;s nice we also have that that&amp;#39;s
    nice okay now unfortunately I am I am going to I&amp;#39;ll do that later um so
    the images are a little dark I think that is the the nature of the Beast another
    part of the of the game here with Freo cap was building the cheapest possible
    system I could possibly get so intentionally targeting like garbage cameras these
    are really garbage cameras like they cost $10 is a pop um on the assumption that
    you know as a researcher buying four GoPros is nothing but if I&amp;#39;m trying
    to make something that&amp;#39;s accessible to the world uh GoPros are expensive
    um so trying to build it on the cheapest possible Hardware was a part of the game
    um okay so we&amp;#39;re going to have to do uh some projective geometry at some
    point so I mentioned that we have the temporal synchronization happening through
    the software um but we are also going to need to know the position of each of
    these cameras in space we&amp;#39;re going to specifically need to know the six
    degree of Freedom position so XYZ location then XYZ rotation so six total numbers
    six degrees of freedom um and the way we&amp;#39;re going to do that is by way
    of a calibration routine um that involves a calibration object um this is called
    a Cho these little markers here are called Aro markers and this is a calibration
    object which many um you know SC every scientific tool will have some calibration
    component to it and the typical pattern for calibration is you&amp;#39;re use
    you use the system to measure something that you know the answer to I&amp;#39;m
    going to use this to measure the position of these Corners in the board because
    I know that these Corners are all 58 mm apart like I know that these blast squares
    are 58 millim wide so if I use this system and I record this shape I know what
    the right answer is so if I if I record the position of the board and I check
    the numbers and it says yeah these are 58 mm apart then I now have some confidence
    that the system is working as intended and now I can use it to measure the unknown
    thing which is the body in space that I&amp;#39;m not going to have any other
    additional measurement and insight about um so every form of scientific research
    is going to involve calibration at some point in some cases that calibration is
    done at the factory when they&amp;#39;re where they make the tool um but in this
    kind of like more hacky DIY world we uh we make do with our own stuff okay how
    we doing on timeing okay on time all right so recording so basically what this
    looks like is I take the board and I show it to the cameras and I make sure that
    each camera has shared views so in this case they can all see it at the same time
    um oh I&amp;#39;m going to need to turn that off actually uh all right you can
    look here but I have to turn this off because there&amp;#39;s too much light I
    I was you got to be careful with the light so uh you can look there if you need
    to um so basically the board the cameras can see the board they have shared views
    of the board um so they can you can do the kind of the the the actually not so
    simple math of if I am camera a and I can see the board from this angle and at
    the same time camera B can see the board and I see it from this angle then camera
    a must be in this position relative to camera B and vice versa um make sure that
    works usually when I do this part of the class I bring my grad student in to help
    me out and this time he was busy so I was like I can do it all on my own and I
    can do it all on my own but it is definitely one of the cases I was like I sure
    wish Aaron was here it&amp;#39;d be nice to have an additional nervous system
    doing this stuff uh so now I&amp;#39;m just manually moving stuff from one folder
    to another just because of the stage of software it&amp;#39;s in um PR what we
    doing uh you going to run you going to crash did I learn picture anyone ah UV
    sync okay we may also another traditional so I tested a lot of this but I didn&amp;#39;t
    I&amp;#39;m realizing now I didn&amp;#39;t test like every part of it um so we
    might find ourselves having a little bit more running on trust that I would have
    preferred okay well as that runs um let&amp;#39;s see what are you doing why okay
    calling the audible so well remember how so uh I will have to process these offline
    because it&amp;#39;s not set up and I don&amp;#39;t have the brain space to do
    the online debugging so this will be a lot more prediction than usual just usually
    I can make this happen in the same time um but but for now so we&amp;#39;ve done
    calibration now we&amp;#39;re going to do simple standing so twoot standing one
    foot and one foot on the left one foot on the right um we would call this a control
    condition because this is the one where we&amp;#39;re not there&amp;#39;s nothing
    will be manipulated in this case um and then we&amp;#39;re going to do this sort
    of manipulation condition which is going to be very similar to this but with this
    sort of sort of extra factor of I will be supporting myself on a chair or a table
    or something like that and your I guess I can use this yeah it&amp;#39;s that
    um and then we&amp;#39;ll do the jumping stuff so for you know yeah and we&amp;#39;re
    not going to be getting uh we&amp;#39;re not going to be getting real time output
    from this this class unfortunately but that just means that the your mental model
    of prediction must work across times okay now I unfortunately have to take my
    shoes off which is fine but I just always feel weird doing it um the main reason
    if I had been smart I would have at least worn lightly colored socks um but you
    can see how dark the ground is and you just can&amp;#39;t see my feet relative
    to the ground so I will Tom soyer up my feet now you can&amp;#39;t um this is
    one of the in a real recording I would be like I&amp;#39;d have lights and stuff
    like that um it&amp;#39;s also one of these cases where like it tends to work
    best like outside in the sun because the sun is very very bright um yeah there
    you go now you can see my feet um still a bit dark still very dark that one&amp;#39;s
    good okay so one and two are a little dark manual oh it looks better on my screen
    okay okay so can I have someone can I request a a stopwatch person thank you uh
    so I&amp;#39;m going to ask for like basically 30 second intervals um so I&amp;#39;ll
    let you know when it&amp;#39;s ready to go um I do have to turn this off again
    and I&amp;#39;ll leave that down and all right where is the and I want to be standing
    like here great all right uh I&amp;#39;ll let you know it&amp;#39;s not right
    now so here we go so I&amp;#39;m going to stand here and I guess yeah start it
    now so this is me standing uh I&amp;#39;m kind of already bored with this so I&amp;#39;m
    going to lean I&amp;#39;m going to be sort of intentionally in all these cases
    leaning as far as I can lean sort of within ideally without moving my feet um
    so I&amp;#39;m leaning all the way to the right and all the way forward uh let
    me know when we hit 30 there cool no great okay so now I&amp;#39;m on one foot
    and my Bas of support has now gotten appreciably smaller and I&amp;#39;m wiggling
    around both for fun and because I&amp;#39;m off balance um so again sort of like
    just look at like what&amp;#39;s happening bodily I&amp;#39;m doing a lot of movement
    but we have some strong predictions we can make about the position of my center
    of mass relative to my Bas of support and you make those preditions even stronger
    thank you um and Y uh when the base of support gets smaller your ability to predict
    the location of the center of Mass gets better like you have more predictive capacity
    because it is a more constrained task there are fewer ways that I can successfully
    complete the task of standing upright when I only have one foot on the ground
    than I do when I have two feet on the ground and and done [Applause] okay great
    so with those predictions in mind um how am I going to do this I think I will
    yeah that works great this is my now my standing stick um so same thing uh sorry
    I your name stopwatch friend stopwatch friend what&amp;#39;s your name isab Isabelle
    thank you uh same thing now for the let&amp;#39;s say let&amp;#39;s call this
    a support condition we&amp;#39;re now going to be using like a stick to support
    myself um outside of my biologically prescribed base of support so we go over
    here and I will stand for a little bit so just go ahead and start the timer whenever
    this is just kind of calibration purposes and then now uh I&amp;#39;m going to
    do the same kind of task of Leaning as far as I can relative to my base of support
    except now I have this stick to sort of assist me so with the knowledge and theoretical
    models of human body that you are armed with like how do you think this is going
    to change that data um so now I&amp;#39;m going to go onto my right foot similarly
    playing all over the place and let&amp;#39;s assume for like when we get this
    data back you&amp;#39;re not going to the stick is not going to be in the data
    uh we will know that it was there and we&amp;#39;ll know that this hand is is
    mounted to the ground um but if you think about what the data will look like you
    can have some predictions there and now we switch feet and so again just like
    think about it what what do you think would be different here it&amp;#39;s been
    a long day it&amp;#39;s like standing in place is not the hardest thing in the
    world but I&amp;#39;m making it difficult and okay cool okay thank you Isabelle
    um H this next part I hope I don&amp;#39;t I hope I don&amp;#39;t die on camera
    but if I do just analyze the data okay okay um so for this one I am going to record
    I&amp;#39;ll say three because that&amp;#39;s what I wrote uh but this is going
    to be standing high jump so I&amp;#39;m going to try to jump as high as I can
    from a standing place and again think about think about what that will look like
    think about what it will look like at this level think about what&amp;#39;s happening
    at the physics level where is the force coming from what when it where is it coming
    from at the the start where is it going at the end what&amp;#39;s happening in
    the middle um what could be measured what could be inferred what additional data
    will you wish you had um and if I break anything you know you can have questions
    about that okay uh I don&amp;#39;t need a timer for this so record so it goes
    in here hello I don&amp;#39;t want to whack myself there God I used to I used
    not weigh as much okay and and that&amp;#39;s all the knees I have today I ask
    do a little bit more okay so big jumps discreet jumps pauses in the middle lot
    of arm swinging and knee torquing this big hip joint doing its thing and some
    amount of air time some amount of cheating in the air time oo uh okay um see this
    going to stay on when I do this next part if it does probably this will be more
    probably be more reliable uh okay okay so now instead of doing sub veral discreet
    high jumps I&amp;#39;m just going to bounce in place uh and I&amp;#39;ll bounce
    in place for as long as I want to which I&amp;#39;m not going to ask anyone to
    time it I&amp;#39;m just going to go until I want to stop may do at least 10 and
    then I&amp;#39;ll just go until I&amp;#39;m tired and I&amp;#39;m already tired
    so we&amp;#39;ll see how that goes oh also pointing out I pulled my legs up I
    pulled the pants up both to expose the nice pale skin below which does well this
    feels bright to us but our eyes um the human eye is incredibly good at adjusting
    to changes in luminance so relative to like a sunny day it&amp;#39;s basically
    Pitch Black in here and we&amp;#39;re just really really good at adapting to that
    um but so I exposed my legs both because they are lighter and they are contrasting
    with the carpet but I&amp;#39;m also trying to give the cameras a view of my knee
    um as opposed to having it be blocked again like if you&amp;#39;re trying if you&amp;#39;re
    trying to predict where my knee is it&amp;#39;s going to be way harder if it&amp;#39;s
    being covered by cloth than it is if it&amp;#39;s directly exposed so it&amp;#39;s
    not just a fashion statement it&amp;#39;s empirically grounded okay so yeah so
    we&amp;#39;ll say we&amp;#39;ll call this discret jumps and we&amp;#39;ll call
    this repeated Hops and boun so again thinking about the behavior thinking about
    the mechanics thinking about the joint torqus thinking about the fatigue where
    does the energy come from what did I have for dinner last night these are the
    questions of biology okay I&amp;#39;m not going to drop time it okay so record
    standing here give that nice calibration of and now we hop okay one 2 3 oh my
    God there&amp;#39;s just so many people looking at me it&amp;#39;s fine also I
    wonder there like are there people below us are they wondering what&amp;#39;s
    happening I don&amp;#39;t know how long have I been jumping how many jumps was
    that I don&amp;#39;t know okay I think I think that&amp;#39;s playing 10 more
    okay one two three four five six 7even 8 nine 10 okay done okay great data collected
    not processed um okay um let me see if I can get this thing running I&amp;#39;ll
    give it one one more College try as they say oh I need to get myself enough time
    to clean up too okay good all righty so let&amp;#39;s see so UV V not that&amp;#39;s
    to look like dot V come on do this from a terminal V uh dot V scrips activate
    EV sync punch that and free mo cap there SK oh Skelly cam damn it do scripts activate
    you sync and REM cap huh huh huh huh oh right you can&amp;#39;t see anything sorry
    sort of the fundamental nature of working on anything for any length of time particularly
    if the thing you&amp;#39;re making is something that other people are using uh
    the version of the thing that other that the people are using is the version that
    you are like ashamed of because like I the code for this I wrote years ago I&amp;#39;ve
    learned so much since then that when I look at this I&amp;#39;m like oh my God
    I&amp;#39;m so sorry to the world for what I&amp;#39;ve done to it okay so this
    is freemo Cap this is the core software um then if I do that I click on that say
    set active recording yes yes run calibration from active recording run calibration
    okay so we&amp;#39;re now running calibration data um and it&amp;#39;s going through
    I can put my shoes on at least um it&amp;#39;s going through and uh detecting
    the boards in the screen um it&amp;#39;ll take a little bit of time but at this
    point I think we should be able to get like we&amp;#39;ll be able to look at something
    by the end of but before the end of the day which will be good does anyone have
    any burning questions while we&amp;#39;re while the thing is running it&amp;#39;s
    one of those things like I&amp;#39;m sure there are many questions so does can
    anyone choose one question from the many that are floating around I also made
    a mistake because I was like talking during this calibration thing so I was like
    doing it and at some point I was like blah blah blah and then so it&amp;#39;s
    longer than it needs to be uh which is rookie mistake this is the code that I
    am like currently rewriting like I&amp;#39;m currently uh rebuilding the calibration
    part of it which will allow it to do much more it&amp;#39;ll be faster okay um
    I guess I could look at the other stuff but I don&amp;#39;t really want to do
    that that feels like cheating like I have recordings from the past but that&amp;#39;s
    that feels like cheating right now um yeah H okay yes okay now this stuff is going
    through yeah great so now now now you have this object should I can&amp;#39;t
    write now for some reason so camera 0o camera 1 camera 2 camera Matrix and then
    these are the two points that matter rotation 1 2 3 translation 1 2 3 camera one
    is defined to zero so these are the six degrees of freedom that we need for each
    of the cameras so we now know where all the cameras are these are measured in
    millimeters and theoretically you know 1 and 1/2 so 1 1500 mm is like 1 and 1/2
    m th M so they say that they&amp;#39;re you know meter to two apart which checks
    out intuitively so now that we have that uh we can okay I think let&amp;#39;s
    look at the jump the big jump that&amp;#39;s the most fun one I think so that
    was the actually yeah oh it&amp;#39;s kind of off screen there but we&amp;#39;ll
    see how that goes uh set is active recording okay these most recent calibration
    and that probably the shortest too so go ahead and process okay okay so if all
    goes well do you see my blender you do see my blender great so now what it&amp;#39;s
    doing is it&amp;#39;s going through and in each of the videos it&amp;#39;s going
    through frame by frame um so let say if it&amp;#39;s a you know a thousand frames
    of recording which is you know whatever 30 seconds or something less than 30 seconds
    actually um then for three cameras you have 3,000 total images and then in each
    of those images you have to run through and do the relatively heavy computation
    of using the convolutional neural network to try to detect where the person is
    in the screen uh in the recording and that will look oh actually that&amp;#39;s
    from old okay never mind um yeah and so then once you have done that you will
    have 3,00 two-dimensional estimates of where I was in space coupled with estimates
    for where each of the cameras were in space and so you can do don&amp;#39;t worry
    about that that&amp;#39;s normal um you from so from the the two-dimensional estimates
    in the images plus the six degree of Freedom positions of the cameras you can
    triangulate the position of each of those point points by basically just imagining
    firing a laser so like tracking my elbow from camera 1 2 and three if you imagine
    you fired a laser from each of those cameras the place where the lasers cross
    over each other is the position of that object in space um and all of that is
    going to happen under the hood very very fast and it&amp;#39;s all just a bunch
    of like like that kind of geometry hasn&amp;#39;t changed in like a thousand years
    it&amp;#39;s the same stuff that that&amp;#39;s like uclid level geometry it&amp;#39;s
    just now being done much much much faster on a strange rectangle of silicone and
    electricity um but yeah once this pink line oh are we still running oh good we
    can actually yeah so it looks roughly like that so this is the output from one
    of the videos so this is so from the perspective of I guess that camera this was
    the location of my right shoulder that&amp;#39;s the left shoulder there&amp;#39;s
    a bunch of points on my face these are hips ankles toes basically tagging all
    the joint centers in two-dimensional image coordinates um which we can and so
    yeah so that&amp;#39;s all well and good it&amp;#39;s useful information but you
    would have a very difficult time doing any of the the because you don&amp;#39;t
    really have a measurement in this case of like where the ground is like you don&amp;#39;t
    really have a measurement of what up is you have up in the image but you can see
    that the image is tilted so if you&amp;#39;re want to say oh you&amp;#39;re moving
    relative to gravity like if you want to say your balance over your feet those
    are all terms that happen in the reference frame of like the physics we said we
    call it the inertial reference frame um and this data is all coming in in camera
    sensor reference frame this is 0 in image coordinates just the upper left point
    of the screen and that&amp;#39;s 0 meaning the upper left corner of the little
    silicone wafer the at the back of the camera thing um so converting that into
    something that is it&amp;#39;s very strange that that one is like running so much
    slower than the others um but to be able to be able to talk about this data in
    sort of these physically grounded terms that we&amp;#39;ve been trying to sort
    of build up uh requires a transfer and sort of a lot of computation to sort of
    to get this data referenced in a inertial reference frame okay what is going on
    okay cool um so now the pink lines are gone which means we&amp;#39;ve done all
    the 2D estimation and this white much much faster line is doing all of the triangulation
    so so uh 550,000 data points uh just cranking yeah and now how we going doing
    that recording data this takes a s now okay yeah it&amp;#39;s now saving stuff
    down to disk and now it will with any luck start cranking yeah come on buddy yeah
    yes and so now this this part of the code is now sending so at this point we&amp;#39;ve
    we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve done the main task we&amp;#39;ve recorded
    the PE the person we&amp;#39;ve done the two-dimensional thing the 3D reconstruction
    has actually already happened um and now a very important often neglected step
    is occurring which is converting it into a human into some visualizable format
    so something that we as humans can look at and make sense of because saving all
    the data out until like a massive CSV Excel spreadsheet is good but like it&amp;#39;s
    still not a a term that we can really make any sense out of so or a format that
    we can make sense out of so this is blender which is a 3D animation software and
    this is where we see if it actually worked well which I feel let&amp;#39;s see
    how it does so I&amp;#39;m not in the screen there we go here I am it&amp;#39;s
    okay so this one is not looking the best so you see this one it&amp;#39;s um the
    image is upside down is it going to it&amp;#39;s going to fix oh man there we
    go so that was actually a nice uh case where this is a good view this is a good
    view this one it&amp;#39;s seeing the skeleton upside down uh so this reconstructive
    view is not going to look right because a third of the data is flipped upside
    down and luckily I took a few steps forward and then it fixed itself and so now
    this is a much better looking skeleton um see time go can&amp;#39;t time so now
    that I know it works I can blame the point um it&amp;#39;s a little bit rotated
    which I can fix later so rotate around X there you go um this pink and blue ball
    here is the calculated Center of mass um the skeleton is sort of more for visualization
    than actual data um this these stick figures here those are the rigid bodies that
    I was talking about so this is the the thigh the upper arm things like that and
    cool yeah great and so now okay so it&amp;#39;s not the best data I&amp;#39;ve
    ever gotten in my life it&amp;#39;s just very dark in here um um but it&amp;#39;s
    not bad and if I look oops so that is the trajectory of my center of mass in the
    Z coordinate so the ground plane we&amp;#39;re going to call XY up is z um and
    yeah and so this is a Time series plot we talked about these last time so the
    x axis is time and then the Y AIS is whatever the the Z value that is the height
    that&amp;#39;s the height of my center of mass above the ground and if you recall
    so if gravity didn&amp;#39;t change my mass didn&amp;#39;t change so that means
    the height tells you my potential energy uh if we assume that this is where I&amp;#39;m
    this is my standing height we can call that zero if we want to that&amp;#39;s
    zero potential energy and then here we see something interesting happening so
    before I you&amp;#39;ve seen this several times now I do got to stop and we&amp;#39;re
    going to talk about this at length next time um but just imagine at like my center
    of mass level like we have some guess about what this Behavior corres responds
    to um so think about what is this dip what is this peak and what is this dip again
    and oops wish I didn&amp;#39;t do that come on there we go so there we go that&amp;#39;s
    my lowest point skeleton&amp;#39;s kind of screwy uh just because it&amp;#39;s
    a weird View and I&amp;#39;m kind of off screen here um but going to go up and
    that&amp;#39;s the peak that&amp;#39;s the apex of the jump that&amp;#39;s the
    highest this is the place my my potential energy is at its highest and my kinetic
    energy in the in the Z position is zero I&amp;#39;m I am paused at that height
    um and now I&amp;#39;m coming back down and again the the the data is not the
    best in the world but you can see that kind of I don&amp;#39;t just land with
    like straight legs I land and I bend into it there&amp;#39;s intuitive reasons
    why but then there&amp;#39;s also like deeper biomechanical and biopys and physiological
    reasons why why this is a lot of energy I have to bleed off and I don&amp;#39;t
    want to Bleed It Off directly into my joints I would rather bleed it off into
    my soft tissue and let the muscles kind of pull against it so that I don&amp;#39;t
    blow out my Meniscus or something like that um and then I do it again and so this
    is also kind of a nice example of why the center of mass is such a nice measurement
    because even in these cases where the data is not that great and the skeleton
    gets all wble garble in these in these particular moments the overall trajectory
    is roughly speaking what you would expect it to be so even in context where the
    data has you know Fidelity issues uh you can still talk about the global data
    because it&amp;#39;s basically a giant smoothing algorithm to just collapse this
    entire thing down to a singular point we uh and then I really I I got to go but
    I can&amp;#39;t help myself uh in range around frame 3030 calculate the whole
    thing okay let play so that is is the frame by frame measurement of it you can
    see this the 3D trajectory oh why did it go oh it&amp;#39;s not doing the whole
    path oh cuz it&amp;#39;s much longer than that uh dat paths all paths there you
    go and here we can even take the whole guy hide him hide him so that is the mechanical
    estimate of the global Behavior okay I will take my time I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll
    clean this up um and think about think about the things we talk about make some
    general predictions um I&amp;#39;m going to make an assignment for y&amp;#39;all
    for next uh for the next for next week about talking to the bot about predictions
    around this data stuff and also about just like the concept of units and measurements
    and how it applies to your particular domain of inquiry um but just you know chew
    on it with your brain

    text: "Okay, hello everybody and welcome to Wednesday. Today is a very special\
      \ day because we are going to do some data collection, which is always an exciting\
      \ time in any scientist's life. You gather numbers, take recordings, and then\
      \ often spend the next while analyzing that data. How it goes matters a lot.\
      \ This is not a particularly high-stakes situation, but it will be fun. So,\
      \ I'm going to try to finish up what I was discussing last time, then I'll set\
      \ up the cameras and do a couple of quick recordings with the free MoCap software\
      \ I developed with my lab over the past six years. If all goes well, it should\
      \ produce something worthwhile today. After that, I will do some additional\
      \ fiddling with it and either have something to say about that on Monday or\
      \ wait to give myself some extra time and talk about it on Wednesday. Your job\
      \ is mostly to just sit and listen and try not to fall asleep; but if you do,\
      \ I understand\u2014you have a lot going on.\n\nSo, behold a human person. It\
      \ is roughly speaking, this shape. This is a complicated shape, but it\u2019\
      s not nearly as complicated as this weird object. However, since we are finite\
      \ beings with finite technology and time, if we wanted to study this complicated\
      \ object\u2014the desire of our research being to understand how humans move\
      \ through the world\u2014we have to make simplifications and assumptions. Last\
      \ time, I talked about my personal favorite oversimplification of a complex\
      \ physical object, which is to take that object and reduce it down to a single\
      \ point mass, which we call the center of mass. The center of mass is often\
      \ referred to as the center of gravity. In that sense, gravity is meant in the\
      \ old-school way of thinking of it as density since density and mass can be\
      \ seen as the same thing in some contexts.\n\nThe beauty of the center of mass\
      \ is that it\u2019s a relatively simple concept. The intuition of the center\
      \ of mass is that if I want to balance a stick on my finger, I put my finger\
      \ under the midpoint of the total distribution of mass on the object, and it\
      \ balances there because there is the same amount of pull on this side as there\
      \ is on that side. If it's a symmetric object, the center of mass corresponds\
      \ to the geometric center of the object itself. If the weight is non-symmetric,\
      \ it complicates the situation, but the same basic idea remains: there is as\
      \ much mass on one side of the base of support as there is on the other side.\
      \ The center of mass will be somewhere between them, and if I want to hold this\
      \ object off the ground, I need to ensure that the base of support is under\
      \ the center of mass. If the center of support is outside the center of mass,\
      \ it will fall in that direction, which, while not particularly mind-blowing,\
      \ is a basic description of balance at a very low level of physics.\n\nRecently,\
      \ we talked about how when an object is flying through the air, it has a nice\
      \ ballistic trajectory caused by the transduction and exchange between kinetic\
      \ and potential energy in a gravity well. Potential energy can be expressed\
      \ as mgh and kinetic energy as 1/2 mv\xB2. Even though this object has a complicated\
      \ form, the trajectory it follows in the air is the same as if I were throwing\
      \ an equivalent mass, like a single lead sphere. If I toss it in the air, it\
      \ would follow the same trajectory. If I spin it, it spins around its center\
      \ of mass. When it\u2019s not in contact with anything that pushes against it,\
      \ there\u2019s no reaction force to push it in any direction, allowing for predictable\
      \ physical behavior.\n\nWe also talked briefly about one of my favorite things:\
      \ pendulums. A standard pendulum consists of a mass hanging below a pivot point.\
      \ If you pull it back and let it go, it will swing back and forth until friction\
      \ bleeds off enough energy for it to eventually slow down. The reason for that\
      \ kind of conservative motion is the same exchange between potential and kinetic\
      \ energy. Imagine a pivot point and a bob\u2014the mass of the pendulum. If\
      \ we assume the string has negligible weight, the center of mass will still\
      \ be mathematically definable. As we let it go from rest at the top, its kinetic\
      \ energy is zero, while its potential energy is maximized. Upon dropping, it\
      \ reaches the lowest point in its swing, where its potential energy is minimized\
      \ and kinetic energy maximized\u2014it moves the fastest here. Thanks to inertia,\
      \ it will carry through the swing until it reaches the other side, momentarily\
      \ pausing\u2014kinetic velocity is again zero and potential energy maximized.\n\
      \nThis cycle repeats in reverse. As long as there are no energy loss mechanisms,\
      \ this motion could theoretically continue forever. In reality, there are always\
      \ factors like friction and air resistance that bleed off energy, leading to\
      \ damping over time. If we were to plot it, let\u2019s say this is the angle\
      \ theta, it would look like this and slowly damp out. If it were an ideal system,\
      \ this would just be..."

    text: "A pendulum moves like a nice sine wave forever, but because there is some\
      \ bleed due to friction, this will create a nice trajectory. This exemplifies\
      \ a standard hanging pendulum. Pendulums are very important in the history of\
      \ science; they are involved in almost every significant measurement, such as\
      \ the gravitational constant and electrostatic force. Apparently, there was\
      \ a time when the period of a pendulum was used for prospecting iron ore. This\
      \ is because you can measure the period of a pendulum very accurately, and it's\
      \ defined by the density, much like the gravitational constant is part of the\
      \ equation of motion. They would move very precise pendula over areas where\
      \ they suspected iron ore might be present. If they measured a change in the\
      \ period, that indicated a higher density in the column between the surface\
      \ and the center of the Earth. I read about this in a book, but I had difficulty\
      \ validating that information. Nonetheless, pendulums are fascinating. \n\n\
      Pendulums are also a great example of periodic motion. Last time, I briefly\
      \ mentioned how we think about time. There\u2019s stopwatch time, which always\
      \ counts up, and then there\u2019s wall clock time, which resets every so often.\
      \ With something like an oscillator, you think in a phasic manner where it goes\
      \ from zero to some maximum and then resets. We call that a full cycle. Many\
      \ aspects of biology exhibit this kind of phasic behavior. A lot of my research\
      \ has historically focused on locomotion, which involves many pendulums. The\
      \ most obvious example of a pendulum in locomotion is the swinging leg. However,\
      \ there is another, more dramatic pendulum: the inverted pendulum of your standing\
      \ body. \n\nThis is a pendulum hanging from a central pivot point. You could\
      \ lift it until it is upright, creating an inverted pendulum. At this point,\
      \ the bottom is a stable position because if we let it go, this is where it\
      \ will settle. In the language of dynamical systems, this is referred to as\
      \ an unstable point. Technically, if you placed this at exactly zero deflection,\
      \ it would stay in position, similar to how a marker can stand upright on a\
      \ desk. However, because this is an unstable point, any perturbation to the\
      \ left or the right will cause it to fall. If it\u2019s slightly off to the\
      \ right, gravity pulls it down until it ultimately falls. \n\nYou can hang a\
      \ pendulum, and it's passively stable; gravity does all the work. You don\u2019\
      t have to worry about it. If the pendulum's base of support is non-zero, you\
      \ can balance it happily on a flat surface, and it will also stay there passively\
      \ forever. However, if the base of support is zero, the only way to balance\
      \ it upright is through active control. This is evidenced in the classic 'broom\
      \ trick,' where you can balance a broom on your hand by moving around the base\
      \ of support to prevent it from tipping over. You can\u2019t just let it go,\
      \ as that would lead to a fall.\n\nNow, all of this serves as a prelude to the\
      \ recordings we are about to make. If you envision an idealized pendulum with\
      \ its center of mass on top, remember we are spending a lot of time thinking\
      \ about Force equals mass times acceleration. We\u2019re assuming the mass doesn\u2019\
      t change, so we can treat Force as equal to acceleration in some approximation.\
      \ If you manage to have it standing up right, and the projection of the center\
      \ of mass onto the ground is zero from the base of support, then it can stand\
      \ upright forever. However, if it\u2019s offset a little and the center of mass\
      \ has a distance from the base of support, gravity will pull it down, imparting\
      \ a force that pushes the object away from the stable point. This is why it\
      \ is unstable\u2014any deviation from zero leads it to fall farther. \n\nIf\
      \ you\u2019re supporting it, like with the broom, you can stabilize it by adjusting\
      \ your base of support. However, if you are the pendulum and your center of\
      \ mass is located just above one leg, you can only control your position by\
      \ applying force into the ground through your foot. If I lean too far forward,\
      \ I can push with my toe to correct myself; if I lean too far back, I can push\
      \ with my heel. But if I don\u2019t have an effective way to apply force, I\
      \ can only push so far. Therefore, my center of mass must remain within the\
      \ base of support to maintain a standing posture without taking a step. If the\
      \ task is to stand upright without stepping, the goal is for the center of mass\
      \ to stay within the base of support, allowing me to adjust my pushing force\
      \ as needed to maintain balance.\n\nThis is balance and standing posture in\
      \ a nutshell. Everything we are discussing falls under the category of biomechanics.\
      \ Anytime you hear someone refer to forces, mechanics, Newton\u2019s laws, centers\
      \ of mass, and joints, you are hearing about biomechanics. If you zoom out from\
      \ those low-level physics concepts and consider this physical object as a biological\
      \ system, with muscles, neurons, sensory systems, etc., you can begin to ask\
      \ questions from a neuroscience perspective about how all these factors integrate\
      \ in a human, with various joints and muscles. \n\nHumans excel at standing\
      \ up; this configuration, with two feet and arms off the ground, is quite unusual\
      \ in the animal kingdom. Most other mammals are quadrupedal, and the only other\
      \ bipeds are birds, most of which can fly. Ground birds, like ostriches, have\
      \ arguably had more time to evolve as bipeds than we have, which is quite impressive.\
      \ Generally speaking, there are very few animals as large as humans that can\
      \ support their entire body weight off the ground on just two feet, making this\
      \ ability quite extraordinary."

    text: "At least in the Maman Kingdom, kangaroos are a good example of bipedal\
      \ locomotion. They cannot really walk on two legs when they are moving; they\
      \ can bounce on two legs, but when they are in place, they crawl around on four\
      \ feet and use their tails. Animals like bears and apes can walk on two feet,\
      \ but they are knuckle walkers. I believe I should just accept that we may be\
      \ the only obligate bipeds in the Maman Kingdom. Being an obligate biped means\
      \ that we don't have any other option; it's bipod or nothing. We are also, as\
      \ far as they can determine, the only animals that have two of the main limbs\
      \ in the tetrapod shape\u2014two limbs on top, two limbs on the bottom, and\
      \ a spine. We are the only ones with well-adapted upper limbs that are not involved\
      \ in locomotion. Even ground birds have wings, but those appendages are not\
      \ very effective. We sacrificed a lot to have the ability to grasp objects,\
      \ and the trade-off is that we now have to perform a sort of gymnastics routine\
      \ every time we want to move from point A to point B. \n\nConsidering this,\
      \ the neural bases of bipedalism and standing posture might seem like a basic\
      \ level of behavior, but they are fundamentally core to our identity as organisms.\
      \ I believe it's worth delving into this. If we share the desire to understand\
      \ how we, as bipedal humans, manage to stand upright and walk effectively, we\
      \ can begin thinking like empirical scientists. We can start asking what measurements\
      \ we can take and what analyses we can perform that will provide insight into\
      \ the neural underpinnings of standing posture. \n\nThere are many options for\
      \ investigation, but we are going to approach this from a full-body perspective.\
      \ For example, we might explore how we detect our lean angle. Is it through\
      \ the vestibular organs in our inner ear, pressure under our feet, or the proprioceptive\
      \ forces in our ankles? How can we measure the sensitivities of these components\
      \ and understand those circuits? We could also look at other animals to inform\
      \ our studies.  \n\nHowever, focusing solely on one part of the task can neglect\
      \ the actual behavior we care about: the ecologically valid behavior of the\
      \ organism in a real-world context, as opposed to an artificially created laboratory\
      \ environment. While we might need to use artificial settings for study purposes,\
      \ it is somewhat disheartening since we know we are not observing the true behavior\
      \ in genuine environments. \n\nAdditionally, jumping exists as a function of\
      \ bipedalism. When we jump, rather than leaning, we exert force into the ground.\
      \ If that force exceeds our body weight, we leave the ground until we dissipate\
      \ that additional energy during descent, at which point we come back down. \
      \ \n\nHow do you feel about that so far? Emotionally prepared for what\u2019\
      s to come? Great! \n\nIn a little while, I will set up cameras that will allow\
      \ us to record full-body 3D kinematic data of a human standing in space. That\
      \ human will be me. I would love to record you all, but the timing doesn\u2019\
      t work out. This configuration of inexpensive cameras and free software will\
      \ provide an approximation of my body at thirty frames per second, with centimeter-scale\
      \ precision for my joints. This data model will tell me where my head, body\
      \ segments, and joints are positioned. \n\nI will begin with calibration, and\
      \ then I will perform a standing task, standing on two feet, then on one foot,\
      \ and then on the other foot, likely for 20 to 30 seconds each. This will result\
      \ in one recording for two feet, one for one foot, and the third for the other\
      \ foot. After that, I'll hold onto a chair while performing the same tasks,\
      \ transitioning from freestanding to leaning over with a hand on the desk. Following\
      \ this, I will make several high jumps and perform a brief jump in place for\
      \ about thirty seconds. That will give us enough recordings. \n\nIn total, we\
      \ will have five recordings to process. Depending on how quickly we can set\
      \ things up, I might truncate processing to manage our time effectively. Your\
      \ task as the audience is to consider these behaviors in relation to the biomechanics\
      \ and center of mass concepts we\u2019ve discussed so far. Make predictions\
      \ about what the data will reveal. You may choose to think about it at the level\
      \ of the full joints\u2014like knees, ankles, and shoulders\u2014but that can\
      \ be overwhelming. Alternatively, you could simplify it to a ground plane, a\
      \ foot, a leg, and the center of mass, predicting the differences in data when\
      \ standing on two legs compared to one leg."

      \ to look like when I take a big jump? What's it going to look like when I take\
      \ a bunch of jumps? Think about it and make some predictions because your ability\
      \ to make predictions about what this is going to do is how you know that you're\
      \ operating within a theoretical framework. There is an assumption that I am\
      \ making, that boiling down this hyper-complex object into a singular 3D point\
      \ mass and saying we will be able to predict the motion of that point mass will\
      \ tell us things about the global organism. That's a strong, bold claim, but\
      \ we're going to operate within that space. I'm going to try to do this without\
      \ crashing my computer too, which is always fun.\n\nGreat. Has anybody here\
      \ worked anywhere near motion capture before? Any experience in physical therapy\
      \ or anything like that? No? Yeah. So, it's one of these things where motion\
      \ capture\u2014mostly where you will have seen it\u2014will be behind the scenes\
      \ in movies and video games and stuff like that. You know a lot of the Lord\
      \ of the Rings stuff with Gollum running around.\n\nAlright, but it has been\
      \ around and used to study human movement for quite some time. Arguably, the\
      \ invention of video was technically what I am doing here. Yes, and then this.\
      \ The original video was created to study horses in motion, based off a bet\
      \ from Vanderbilt about whether or not horses ever had a point in their gallop\
      \ when they were all four feet off the ground. You've probably seen the picture\
      \ of a bunch of horses in old-timey video.\n\nBasically, to solve that bet,\
      \ Vanderbilt commissioned a photographer to take a bunch of sequential videos\
      \ of a horse in full gallop and was able to show that there is, in fact, a phase\
      \ where all the feet are off the ground. Since then, motion capture has been\
      \ used in the study of human movement and clinical stuff for as long as we've\
      \ been doing that. Traditionally, it's not a very common thing to do because\
      \ it's very expensive. The motion capture lab I have in Richmond has about four\
      \ million dollars worth of motion capture equipment in it, and it\u2019s in\
      \ a room that was specifically built for the purpose of doing motion capture.\
      \ It\u2019s a very good system; it\u2019s very precise, but it\u2019s also a\
      \ huge pain to use and very expensive.\n\nThe number of people studying human\
      \ movement is much larger than the number who can afford motion capture. That\
      \ was part of the motivation I had for making this strange system. I realized\
      \ around 2017 when a software came out called OpenPose, which used convolutional\
      \ neural networks to basically draw a stick figure on a person in a video. I\
      \ saw that, and then, sometime later, I realized that that capacity to estimate\
      \ a 2D skeleton on a person in a scene was enough to build a motion capture\
      \ system out of.\n\nThat was sort of an idea I had. The thought was, that's\
      \ a cool idea, but I don't know how to write code, and that seems like way too\
      \ much work. So, I figured I would never do it. Then three years later, COVID\
      \ hit, and I lost access to my lab for an indefinite period of time. I also\
      \ lost faith in the academic system pretty much entirely and started rethinking\
      \ the idea. \n\nI began to really doubt the core principle of science, which\
      \ is that the best thing we can do as scientists is to publish papers in esoteric\
      \ journals that exploit us for profit. I started thinking about whether this\
      \ behavior is actually making the world a better place and had the uncomfortable\
      \ realization that I don't really think it does. While it's a good thing to\
      \ do, I believe scientists are generally trying to improve the world, but we're\
      \ trapped in communication systems that don't serve us. It made sense in the\
      \ 1800s; it just doesn\u2019t make sense now.\n\nI personally transitioned away\
      \ from publishing papers in journals toward using the skills and understanding\
      \ that I have from my history of scientific research to build tools that people\
      \ can actually use in their real lives. So, this is one of them. \n\nReal quick,\
      \ if you want to look it up, Free Mo Cap\u2014just Google Free Mo Cap\u2014\
      you'll find it. It\u2019s pretty... oh, I\u2019m not on the internet? Am I on\
      \ the internet? I am on the internet. Yeah! Hey, look; people make videos about\
      \ me. But yeah, you can look it up. It\u2019s been a whole process.\n\nSo, Free\
      \ Mo Cap stands for free motion capture. It is a markerless motion capture system.\
      \ The majority of traditional motion capture involves wearing spandex suits\
      \ with reflective dots. This is markerless. The idea is to use modern computer\
      \ vision technology\u2014wacky stuff we can do with that\u2014to play the role\
      \ that the markers used to play in traditional motion capture systems.\n\nLet\u2019\
      s talk a little bit more about what that means. The hardest part of making this\
      \ process, the most sophisticated part of the code by a mile, is the part that\
      \ connects to the cameras. Maybe it shouldn't have been as surprising. \n\n\
      Yeah, I think that makes sense. Everything has a logo; Skelly is the logo. It\u2019\
      s like a skeleton, you see? It\u2019s kind of how it works. My personal journey\
      \ as a researcher began in philosophy; I got a bachelor\u2019s degree in philosophy.\
      \ Then I started doing more perceptual motor neuroscience, studying vision from\
      \ a vision science perspective. \n\nHowever, it felt insufficient and incomplete\

    text: "Guys, that\u2019s why there are skeletons everywhere. It\u2019s sort of\
      \ like a joke that I study neuroscience from the perspective of a skeleton because,\
      \ physics-wise, it\u2019s mostly about the skeleton. The neural components are\
      \ really not what Newton notices; he mostly focuses on the skeleton. Anyway,\
      \ this is the latest form of the software. Actually, it\u2019s not the main\
      \ software, so the current stage of development of Free Moap is that the core\
      \ software is a little bit behind the development side of it. We\u2019re using\
      \ this camera stuff, and it\u2019s very slow for some reason. Why are we so\
      \ slow? Okay, there we go. Oh right, I have to turn you off over here. Apologies.\
      \ Oh, I guess we can do that. So, turn you off. Okay, there you go. Let me shut\
      \ you down. This is one of those places where all the stuff streaming by is\
      \ where all the work went, and then the outside is quite simple in comparison.\
      \ I\u2019m reasonably confident that this will work, but anytime... oh wait,\
      \ that\u2019s still okay. Hopefully, that should work better. We can hope. So,\
      \ as a scientific tool, motion capture is in a very crowded space of being a\
      \ camera-based research tool. The environmental energy that we are encoding\
      \ and recording in this case will be light. Light bounces off of me, goes through\
      \ the lens of the camera, and gets absorbed by the camera sensor, which is just\
      \ a little rectangular silicon wafer, whatever one of those is accurate. We\
      \ will be pulling samples from a light cone from three different locations in\
      \ space, 30 times per second. There has been a lot of work, I mean a lot\u2014\
      a lot of years of my life has been spent making sure that the videos recorded\
      \ from these cameras are synchronous. As each camera pulls frames from its field\
      \ of view, there is a lot of code under the hood that ensures that each camera\
      \ pulls at close to the same time as the others as possible. So, we are pulling\
      \ synchronized videos. We talked about the concept of spatiotemporal calibration\
      \ in recording, which includes the spatial and temporal components. The temporal\
      \ components here are handled by the software, so we will assume that all the\
      \ samples from each camera are synchronized in time to some approximation. The\
      \ second part of that is the spatial. Let\u2019s see, those are all rotated;\
      \ are they rotated the same way? They are, which is counterclockwise. I think\
      \ that should work. Did I get that right? I got it backwards; it\u2019s always\
      \ backwards. Okay, good. It\u2019s not using the space particularly well, but\
      \ don\u2019t worry about that. Now I\u2019m going to point the cameras. I\u2019\
      m going to stand right here and try to point the cameras so they can all get\
      \ a good view of that spot. All right, I have that one; that\u2019s nice. We\
      \ also have that; that\u2019s nice. Now unfortunately, I\u2019m going to...\
      \ I\u2019ll do that later. The images are a little dark; I think that is the\
      \ nature of the beast. Another part of the game here with Free Moap was building\
      \ the cheapest possible system I could get, intentionally targeting low-cost\
      \ cameras. These are really low-quality cameras; they cost $10 each. The assumption\
      \ is that, as a researcher, buying four GoPros is nothing, but if I\u2019m trying\
      \ to make something accessible to the world, GoPros are expensive. So trying\
      \ to build it on the cheapest possible hardware was part of the challenge. We\u2019\
      re going to have to do some projective geometry at some point. I mentioned that\
      \ we have temporal synchronization happening through the software, but we also\
      \ need to know the position of each of these cameras in space. Specifically,\
      \ we need to know the six degrees of freedom position\u2014XYZ location and\
      \ XYZ rotation, totaling six numbers. The way we\u2019re going to do that is\
      \ through a calibration routine involving a calibration object. This is called\
      \ a checkerboard; these little markers here are called ARO markers, and this\
      \ is a calibration object. Every scientific tool will have some calibration\
      \ component, and the typical pattern for calibration involves using the system\
      \ to measure something that you know the answer to. I\u2019m going to use this\
      \ to measure the position of these corners on the board because I know that\
      \ these corners are all 58 mm apart. If I record the position of the board and\
      \ it says that these are 58 mm apart, then I now have confidence that the system\
      \ is working as intended, allowing me to use it to measure the unknown thing,\
      \ which is the body in space that I won\u2019t have any other measurement or\
      \ insight about. Every form of scientific research involves calibration at some\
      \ point. In some cases, that calibration is done at the factory where they make\
      \ the tool, but in this DIY world, we make do with our own methods. How are\
      \ we doing on timing? Okay, we\u2019re doing all right. So, recording basically\
      \ looks like this: I take the board and show it to the cameras, ensuring that\
      \ each camera has overlapping views. So in this case, they can all see it at\
      \ the same time. Oh, I need to turn that off, actually. You can look here, but\
      \ I have to turn this off because there's too much light. You've got to be careful\
      \ with the light. Basically, the cameras can see the board; they have shared\
      \ views of the board, so we can do the math. If I am camera A and I can see\
      \ the board from this angle, and at the same time, camera B can see the board\
      \ from another angle, then camera A must be in this position relative to camera\
      \ B, and vice versa."

      \ bit more running on trust than I would have preferred. Okay, well as that\
      \ runs, let\u2019s see. What are you doing? Why? Okay, calling the audible.\
      \ Remember how I will have to process these offline because it\u2019s not set\

      \ will involve a lot more prediction than usual. Usually, I can make this happen\
      \ in the same time. But for now, we\u2019ve done calibration, and now we\u2019\
      re going to do simple standing: two-foot standing, one foot on the left, and\
      \ one foot on the right. We would call this a control condition because this\
      \ is the one where nothing will be manipulated. Then we\u2019re going to do\
      \ this sort of manipulation condition, which is going to be very similar but\
      \ will have the extra factor of me supporting myself on a chair or a table or\
      \ something like that. I guess I can use this. Yeah, it\u2019s that. Then we\u2019\
      ll do the jumping stuff. We\u2019re not going to be getting real-time output\
      \ from this class, unfortunately, but that just means that your mental model\
      \ of prediction must work across times. Now, I unfortunately have to take my\
      \ shoes off, which is fine, but I always feel weird doing it. The main reason\
      \ is, if I had been smart, I would have at least worn lightly-colored socks.\
      \ You can see how dark the ground is, and you just can\u2019t see my feet relative\
      \ to the ground. So I will Tom Sawyer up my feet. Now you can\u2019t\u2014this\
      \ is one of those cases where, in a real recording, I would have lights and\
      \ stuff like that. It also tends to work best outside in the sun because sunlight\
      \ is very bright. Yeah, there you go; now you can see my feet. Still a bit dark,\
      \ still very dark\u2014that one's good. Okay, so one and two are a little dark.\
      \ Manual. Oh, it looks better on my screen. Okay, so can I have someone\u2014\
      can I request a stopwatch person? Thank you. I\u2019m going to ask for about\
      \ 30-second intervals, so I\u2019ll let you know when it\u2019s ready to go.\
      \ I do have to turn this off again, and I\u2019ll leave that down. All right,\
      \ where is the\u2026? I want to be standing like here. Great. All right, I\u2019\
      ll let you know when it\u2019s not ready right now. So here we go; I\u2019m\
      \ going to stand here, and I guess\u2026 yeah, start it now. So this is me standing.\
      \ I\u2019m kind of already bored with this, so I\u2019m going to lean. I\u2019\
      m going to be intentionally in all these cases leaning as far as I can, ideally\
      \ without moving my feet. So I\u2019m leaning all the way to the right and all\
      \ the way forward. Let me know when we hit 30. There? Cool. No? Great. Okay,\
      \ so now I\u2019m on one foot, and my base of support has now gotten appreciably\
      \ smaller. I\u2019m wiggling around both for fun and because I\u2019m off balance.\
      \ Again, just look at what\u2019s happening bodily. I\u2019m doing a lot of\
      \ movement, but we have some strong predictions we can make about the position\
      \ of my center of mass relative to my base of support. You can make those predictions\
      \ even stronger. Thank you. When the base of support gets smaller, your ability\
      \ to predict the location of the center of mass gets better; you have more predictive\
      \ capacity because it is a more constrained task. There are fewer ways that\
      \ I can successfully complete the task of standing upright when I only have\
      \ one foot on the ground than when I have two feet on the ground. And done.\
      \ [Applause] Okay, great. So with those predictions in mind, how am I going\
      \ to do this? I think I will\u2026 yeah, that works great. This is now my standing\
      \ stick. So, same thing. Sorry, your name, stopwatch friend? Stopwatch friend,\
      \ what\u2019s your name? Isabelle? Thank you. Okay, same thing now for the\u2014\
      let\u2019s say this is a support condition. We\u2019re now going to be using\
      \ a stick to support myself outside of my biologically prescribed base of support.\
      \ So we\u2019ll go over here, and I will stand for a little bit. Just go ahead\
      \ and start the timer whenever; this is just kind of calibration purposes. Now,\
      \ I\u2019m going to do the same kind of task of leaning as far as I can relative\
      \ to my base of support, except now I have this stick to assist me. So, with\
      \ the knowledge and theoretical models of the human body that you are armed\
      \ with, how do you think this is going to change the data? Now, I\u2019m going\
      \ to go onto my right foot, similarly playing all over the place. And let\u2019\
      s assume that, when we get this data back, you\u2019re not going to see the\
      \ stick in the data. We\u2019ll know it was there, and we\u2019ll know that\
      \ this hand is mounted to the ground. But if you think about what the data will\
      \ look like, you can have some predictions there. Now we switch feet, and so\
      \ again, just think about it. What do you think would\u2026?"

      \ what I wrote, but this is going to be a standing high jump. I'm going to try\
      \ to jump as high as I can from a standing position. Again, think about what\
      \ that will look like. Think about what it will look like at this level. Consider\
      \ what's happening at the physics level: Where is the force coming from? Where\
      \ is it going at the end? What's happening in the middle? What could be measured?\
      \ What could be inferred? What additional data will you wish you had? If I break\

      \ so I will record. Here we go. I don't want to whack myself. God, I used to\
      \ not weigh as much. And that's all the knees I have today. I can do a little\
      \ bit more. So, big jumps, discrete jumps, pauses in the middle, a lot of arm\
      \ swinging and knee torquing\u2014this big hip joint doing its thing\u2014and\
      \ some amount of air time, some amount of cheating in the air time. Okay, this\
      \ is going to stay on when I do this next part. If it does, this will probably\
      \ be more reliable. Okay, so now instead of doing several discrete high jumps,\
      \ I'm just going to bounce in place. I'll bounce in place for as long as I want\
      \ to. I'm not going to ask anyone to time it; I'm just going to go until I want\
      \ to stop. I'll do at least ten and then just go until I'm tired. I\u2019m already\
      \ tired, so we'll see how that goes. Also, I pulled my pants up to expose the\
      \ nice pale skin below. This feels bright to us, but the human eye is incredibly\
      \ good at adjusting to changes in luminance. So, relative to a sunny day, it's\
      \ basically pitch black in here, and we're really good at adapting to that.\
      \ I exposed my legs both because they are lighter, contrasting with the carpet,\
      \ but I'm also trying to give the cameras a view of my knee. If you're trying\
      \ to predict where my knee is, it's much harder if it's covered by cloth than\
      \ if it's directly exposed. So, it's not just a fashion statement; it\u2019\
      s empirically grounded. We'll call this discrete jumps and we'll call this repeated\
      \ hops and bounces. Again, think about the behavior, the mechanics, the joint\
      \ torques, the fatigue. Where does the energy come from? What did I have for\
      \ dinner last night? These are the questions of biology. I'm not going to time\

      \ me; it's fine. I wonder if there are people below us wondering what's happening.\
      \ I don't know how long I've been jumping or how many jumps that was. I don't\
      \ know. Okay, I think that\u2019s ten more. One, two, three, four, five, six,\
      \ seven, eight, nine, ten. Okay, done. Great, data collected, not processed.\
      \ Let me see if I can get this thing running. I'll give it one more college\

      \ I started to chat, and then it took longer than it needed to, which is a rookie\
      \ mistake. This is the code that I am currently rewriting; I'm rebuilding the\

      \ I guess I could look at the other data, but I don\u2019t really want to do\
      \ that; it feels like cheating. I have recordings from the past, and that feels\
      \ like cheating right now. Yes, okay, now this data is going through, great.\
      \ So now, now you have this object. I can't write now for some reason, so camera\
      \ 0, camera 1, camera 2, camera matrix, and these are the two points that matter:\
      \ rotation 1, 2, 3; translation 1, 2, 3. Camera one is defined as zero, so these\
      \ are the six degrees of freedom that we need for each of the cameras. We now\
      \ know where all the cameras are. These are measured in millimeters, and theoretically,\
      \ 1500 mm is about 1.5 meters. They state that they're about 1 to 2 meters apart,\
      \ which checks out intuitively. Now that we have that, let\u2019s look at the\
      \ big jump; that\u2019s the most fun one, I think. Oh, it\u2019s kind of off-screen\
      \ there, but we'll see how that goes. Setting it as the active recording, okay,\
      \ this is the most recent calibration and probably the shortest too, so let's\
      \ go ahead and process. If all goes well, do you see my Blender? You do see\
      \ my Blender, great! What it's doing now is going through each of the videos\
      \ frame by frame. Let\u2019s say if it\u2019s, you know, a thousand frames of\
      \ recording, which is less than 30 seconds, actually, for three cameras, that\
      \ gives you 3,000 total images. In each of those images, you have to run through\
      \ and do the relatively heavy computation of using the convolutional neural\
      \ network to try to detect where the person is in the recording. Once you have\
      \ done that, you will have 3,000 two-dimensional estimates of where I was in\
      \ space, coupled with estimates for where each of the cameras were in space.\
      \ From the two-dimensional estimates in the images, plus the six degrees of\
      \ freedom positions of the cameras, you can triangulate the position of each\
      \ of those points by essentially imagining firing a laser. For example, tracking\
      \ my elbow from cameras 1, 2, and 3: if you imagine firing a laser from each\
      \ of those cameras, the place where the lasers cross over each other is the\
      \ position of that object in space. All of this will happen quickly, under the\
      \ hood. It\u2019s all just a bunch of geometry that hasn\u2019t changed significantly\
      \ over a thousand years; it\u2019s the same stuff as Euclid-level geometry but\
      \ being done much, much faster on a strange rectangle of silicon and electricity.\
      \ Once this pink line... are we still running? Oh good, we can actually... so\
      \ it looks roughly like that. This is the output from one of the videos. From\
      \ the perspective of that camera, this was the location of my right shoulder,\
      \ and that\u2019s the left shoulder. There are several points on my face, these\
      \ are my hips, ankles, and toes, basically tagging all the joint centers in\
      \ two-dimensional image coordinates. This is all useful information, but you\
      \ would have a very difficult time making sense of it because you don\u2019\
      t really have a measurement in this case of where the ground is. You don\u2019\
      t have a measurement of what \u2018up\u2019 is; you have \u2018up\u2019 in the\
      \ image, but the image is tilted. So if you want to say, \"Oh, you\u2019re moving\
      \ relative to gravity,\" like if you want to assess your balance over your feet,\
      \ those terms occur within the context of the reference frame we call the inertial\
      \ reference frame. This data is all coming in the camera sensor reference frame;\
      \ this is 0 in image coordinates, which is the upper left point of the screen.\
      \ This is 0, meaning the upper left corner of the little silicon wafer at the\
      \ back of the camera. It\u2019s very strange that one is running so much slower\
      \ than the others, but to talk about this data in physically grounded terms\
      \ requires a transfer and a lot of computation to reference this data in an\
      \ inertial reference frame. Okay, what is going on? Okay, cool. The pink lines\

      \ this reconstructive view is not going to look right because a third of the\
      \ data is flipped upside down, and luckily, I took a few steps forward, and\
      \ then it fixed itself. Now this is a much better looking skeleton. Um, let\u2019\
      s see. Can\u2019t time. So now that I know it works, I can blame the points.\
      \ Um, it's a little bit rotated, which I can fix later. So rotate around X;\
      \ there you go. Um, this pink and blue ball here is the calculated center of\
      \ mass. Um, the skeleton is sort of more for visualization than actual data.\
      \ Um, these stick figures here, those are the rigid bodies that I was talking\
      \ about. So this is the thigh, the upper arm, things like that. And cool, yeah,\
      \ great. So now, okay, it's not the best data I\u2019ve ever gotten in my life;\
      \ it's just very dark in here. Um, um, but it\u2019s not bad. And if I look\u2014\
      oops, so that is the trajectory of my center of mass in the Z coordinate. So\
      \ the ground plane, we\u2019re going to call XY, and up is Z. Um, and yeah,\
      \ and so this is a time series plot; we talked about these last time. So the\
      \ X axis is time, and then the Y axis is whatever the Z value is; that is the\
      \ height, that\u2019s the height of my center of mass above the ground. And\
      \ if you recall\u2014so if gravity didn\u2019t change and my mass didn\u2019\
      t change, that means the height tells you my potential energy. Uh, if we assume\
      \ that this is where I\u2019m standing, we can call that zero; that\u2019s zero\
      \ potential energy. And then here, we see something interesting happening. So\
      \ before I\u2014you\u2019ve seen this several times now. I do have to stop,\
      \ and we\u2019re going to talk about this at length next time. Um, but just\
      \ imagine at, like, my center of mass level\u2014we have some guess about what\
      \ this behavior corresponds to. Um, so think about what this dip is, what this\
      \ peak is, and what this dip again is. Oops, wish I didn\u2019t do that. Come\
      \ on, there we go. So there we go; that\u2019s my lowest point. The skeleton's\
      \ kind of screwy just because it\u2019s a weird view, and I\u2019m kind of off-screen\
      \ here. Um, but I'm going up and that\u2019s the peak; that\u2019s the apex\
      \ of the jump. That\u2019s the highest; this is the place my potential energy\
      \ is at its highest, and my kinetic energy in the Z position is zero. I\u2019\
      m paused at that height. Um, and now I\u2019m coming back down. Again, the data\
      \ is not the best in the world, but you can see that I don\u2019t just land\
      \ with straight legs. I land and I bend into it. There are intuitive reasons\
      \ why, but there are also deeper biomechanical and physiological reasons why.\
      \ This is a lot of energy I have to bleed off, and I don\u2019t want to bleed\
      \ it off directly into my joints. I would rather bleed it off into my soft tissue\
      \ and let the muscles kind of pull against it so that I don\u2019t blow out\
      \ my meniscus or something like that. Um, and then I do it again. And so this\
      \ is also kind of a nice example of why the center of mass is such a nice measurement.\
      \ Because even in these cases where the data is not that great and the skeleton\
      \ gets all garbled in these particular moments, the overall trajectory is roughly\
      \ what you would expect it to be. So even in contexts where the data has fidelity\
      \ issues, you can still talk about the global data, because it\u2019s basically\
      \ a giant smoothing algorithm to just collapse this entire thing down to a singular\
      \ point. We\u2014uh, and then I really\u2014I got to go, but I can\u2019t help\
      \ myself. Uh, in range around frame 3030, calculate the whole thing. Okay, let\u2019\
      s play. So that is the frame-by-frame measurement of it; you can see the 3D\
      \ trajectory. Oh, why did it go? Oh, it\u2019s not doing the whole path. Oh,\
      \ \u2018cause it\u2019s much longer than that. Uh, data paths, all paths. There\
      \ you go. And here we can even take the whole guy, hide him\u2014hide him. So\
      \ that is the mechanical estimate of the global behavior. Okay, I will take\
      \ my time and I\u2019ll clean this up. Um, and think about the things we talked\
      \ about. Make some general predictions. Um, I\u2019m going to make an assignment\
      \ for you all for next week about talking to the bot about predictions around\
      \ this data stuff and also about just the concept of units and measurements\
      \ and how it applies to your particular domain of inquiry. Um, but just, you\
      \ know, chew on it with your brain."

- full_transcript: let try that again okay hello everybody and welcome to this I guess
    February um made it to February which is great an additional month um so last
    time we recorded a bunch of data and today we&amp;#39;re going to look at it sort
    of at various stages of development this is kind of the output of one of the recordings
    that we can we talk about the kind of like semantic level um semantic meaning
    like meaning and then syntactic is like structure um before we do that uh just
    you know sort of standard weekly update on the status of my main project for the
    semester which is making sense of all the good data you&amp;#39;ve been pumping
    into the machine um so just again like a standard scrape the server recalculate
    stuff um shove it into a zip file you can open it an obsidian this one is slightly
    different it&amp;#39;s I guess speaking of what I just talked about syntactically
    these is these two are exactly the same they have all the same folders all the
    same file names probably um but semantically meaning wise this one the most recent
    one the the the user profile part that kind of like looks at what you&amp;#39;ve
    been talking about and guesses what your interests are only looks at your chats
    in the assignments category so the stuff you&amp;#39;ve been doing in class and
    sort of like any of the bot playground stuff um is not getting used as part of
    that calculation I didn&amp;#39;t really like check it too closely for like how
    that changed things um but if you don&amp;#39;t mind pop it open take a look at
    yours and hypothetically it should be sort of a better match to what your interests
    are um also uh you can check and see if like if all of if if you have two chats
    in both places and it&amp;#39;s only showing one you know I guess let me know
    from like a bug report perspective but like don&amp;#39;t stress too much about
    it um we&amp;#39;re not going to look at that right now maybe sometime soon um
    I also have been informed that I am I am required to give you an exam but I&amp;#39;m
    so we&amp;#39;re going to do another Chat thing if that one&amp;#39;s going to
    be an exam so you&amp;#39;ll get a grade on whether or not you did it um but I
    think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;ll be a little more I I&amp;#39;ll put a little
    more effort into like the prompt to kind of like it&amp;#39;ll be asking you questions
    about your chosen topic and sort of relating it to the kind of like empirical
    sort of stuff we&amp;#39;ve been doing before like okay for your topic like what
    are the units that are involved what are the what are the like the methodological
    approaches like what kind like what do their measurements look like what do their
    studies look like and I&amp;#39;ll be asking you kind of those like what units
    are relevant to that domain um so asking questions like the bot will interview
    you about your chosen topic on the sort of relevant to the convers the stuff we&amp;#39;ve
    been talking about before um but you&amp;#39;ve you&amp;#39;ve seen how this thing
    operates now it&amp;#39;s not going to be withholding uh it will be asking you
    those questions but it&amp;#39;ll also be like down to help so if you you know
    if you don&amp;#39;t know just like ask it just and do yourself a favor and look
    it up um and yeah and then so on Wednesday I have a mind for like another kind
    of group class activity that will be based on again like forming into small groups
    um and kind of taking turns trying to find an additional paper that&amp;#39;s
    relevant to your chosen topic um and sort of basically trying to intentionally
    kind of like choose papers that are very dissimilar from the ones that you chose
    initially but are still within the same domain um in order to kind of like flesh
    that stuff out and uh and I think after that session I&amp;#39;ll do the that
    sort of pseudo exam Chat thing in the following week um yeah so if anybody asks
    it&amp;#39;s an exam and you&amp;#39;re very stressed out and it&amp;#39;s difficult
    and you feel like pressured to perform and out compete your peers so you know
    just make sure you know if anybody asks you&amp;#39;re being rank ordered by human
    quality which is disgusting but anyways um cool okay uh that sound good anybody
    any emotional outbursts thoughts feelings great uh cool so uh last time last time
    we recorded um okay let&amp;#39;s make our way towards it by way of review so
    a couple of times ago we talked about like units and space and stuff like that
    and sort of like you know ukian geometry and then three dimension stuff and SI
    units in terms of mass and kilog and seconds which I just often I sort of like
    notice that it&amp;#39;s like kilograms is the SI unit like a thousand grams like
    why isn&amp;#39;t it grams I don&amp;#39;t know I think there&amp;#39;s some stuff
    in the history of these things where like they pick a number for like the unit
    base unit for gram and then lat we decide it&amp;#39;s like that&amp;#39;s too
    small let&amp;#39;s make it a kilogram it&amp;#39;s more viable anyways uh not
    relevant to the present conversation we talked about mass and kilograms and seconds
    and derived units like Newtons which is like kilogram oh drive units like speed
    like milligram like milligrams meters per second and then Newtons which is like
    kilogram met per seconds and then Jewels which is oh per second squared then Jews
    Like kilogram met squared per second squared or whatever we talked about all that
    we talked about pendulums as they swing back and forth and we talked about uh
    inverted pendulums in terms of like things that can be balanced above the ground
    uh through a sort of minimally hinge jointy type of thing at the ground and also
    I guess that&amp;#39;s while we&amp;#39;re here this this is a nice model of a
    person where these two things represent muscles in the ankle joint and so this
    is you trying to stand up look at you go you&amp;#39;re doing great [Music] um
    yeah and so we we sort of laid all that stuff out in terms of like setting up
    the landscape of the general study of human movement at this sort of like holistic
    like human scale type of approach so not the sort of zoomed in looking at cells
    looking at individual muscles much much more zoomed out let&amp;#39;s sort of
    examine this physical system to the level of fidelity that we can sort of record
    and reconstruct it um and uh this is a software why am I looking at the screen
    uh this is a software called blender it is a animation software it&amp;#39;s free
    to open source you can download it um I will I&amp;#39;ll Endeavor by Wednesday
    to have the data that we recorded in a place and in a sort of format that is easy
    for y&amp;#39;all to like download and look at um it&amp;#39;s not there yet I
    but um I&amp;#39;ll try to get that up by Wednesday so that you can kind of Click
    around and then depending on your interests I think Wednesday we&amp;#39;ll try
    to focus on the paper thing but then in a later date we might have some more kind
    of like individualized work and you kind of decide if you want to sort of dig
    deeper into this side of things um right and then right and so in service of understanding
    all of using sort of studying human movement in the natural world where in this
    context we are presenting that that this sort of rough couple square meters of
    space is the natural world this is my this is my ecological niche this is the
    space of the environment where this particular organism operates so it&amp;#39;s
    valid um and I&amp;#39;ve spent a lot of time in front of cameras so you know
    not too much artifice there um but we recorded looks like five separate recordings
    one this doesn&amp;#39;t zoom in does it no uh the first one is calibration that
    was part where I set up the cameras and I sort of showed it that grid uh sort
    of shape thing an object of known shape and known size that&amp;#39;s very easy
    to track which I could use to kind of like characterize the positions of the cameras
    and sort of localize them in space which is a necessary thing so again calibration
    has the general shape where you set up your equipment then you measure something
    that you already know the answer to the question about what is that thing that
    I&amp;#39;m measuring and if there&amp;#39;s a little more going on in this sort
    of computational Step but that&amp;#39;s the general idea with the sort of principle
    being if the tool if I use the tool to measure something where I already know
    the answer if it gives me the answer that I know is right then that&amp;#39;s
    some indication that the tool is actually measuring the world in a way that I
    care about and so from there I can move on to measuring stuff in the world where
    I don&amp;#39;t know the answer so which is in this case you know a h and moving
    around in space so from there we started there were these two kind of matched
    um this is like a little mini baby experiment uh where the First Recording was
    standing balance sort of a control and that was split into three phases one is
    sort of two feet one foot left and then one foot right so standing on two feet
    standing on one foot standing on standing on one foot which is my left foot and
    standing on the other foot which is my right foot and then the sort of kind of
    more experimental condition which is you know it&amp;#39;s not a particularly
    like exciting experiment sort of this is like a classic case where I&amp;#39;m
    like I&amp;#39;m choosing the experiment that I where I I&amp;#39;m pretty sure
    I know what the answer will be because I&amp;#39;m trying to make a particular
    point in relation to this sort of particular um theoretical description of the
    desideratum of my research study which in this case is the explication of the
    neural control of human balance so this one is we call I called it standing with
    support uh and these are these has matched conditions where I do all the same
    things in the manipulated condition forget I forget the op like control is the
    one where you didn&amp;#39;t change anything I forget the name of the one where
    you change something but in this one uh I am doing the same same behaviors except
    now I&amp;#39;m using that stick as like a point of support um and in this so
    with this sort of difference in the behaviors and the sort of measurement Fidelity
    that I expect to be able to get and the theoretical framework of this sort of
    like this strange idea that we can boil down a human into to a singular Point
    Mass since that might be informative about the behavior in question these things
    all kind of like form into something where you can make predictions about the
    future and then we can you know using the data that we have sort of check those
    predictions so I&amp;#39;m not going to uh spoil the game just yet but I&amp;#39;ll
    bet you can I&amp;#39;ll bet you can make some guesses about how these conditions
    will vary um oh and importantly for the two feet standing I didn&amp;#39;t just
    stand here straight uh I was like leaning as far as I could in in all the directions
    that I could sort of based off of my internal sense of like how far I can lean
    without having to go so far that I need to take a step to stay upright uh then
    there are these two other conditions one which I call three big jumps um putting
    three in the title is just kind of like a hint for me because eventually you want
    to you want to sort of chop this up into smaller pieces so telling myself that
    there are three here helps me sort of know how many to look for um and then the
    second one is repeated jumps um for some amount of time I don&amp;#39;t know uh
    I also just to be clear I am calling out the fact that I&amp;#39;m calling that
    I&amp;#39;m calling this three big jumps not is not to say like this is a good
    way to name your trials and record data um this is actually not a good way to
    like you don&amp;#39;t want to bake that kind of stuff into the title of it but
    this is kind of just easy like you know it&amp;#39;s a I&amp;#39;m allowing it
    because I&amp;#39;m doing it and you can do it too and you will discover through
    practice why it&amp;#39;s not a good idea and I&amp;#39;ll leave that as an exercise
    to your future um great do we feel caught up do we feel aware of the situation
    great um I&amp;#39;ll leave that there so today I think I&amp;#39;m going to focus
    on the two standing ones um we&amp;#39;ll see how far we get with that we talked
    we showed the the jumping data from last time at least the big jump data um but
    we&amp;#39;ll get sort of back to it uh actually there&amp;#39;s one more distinction
    I want to highlight here uh and this is less about the the data that we recorded
    and sort of like the purposes for recording it and more just something I want
    to point out about like a a difference between these behaviors so specific the
    B the balance and posture Behavior versus like a jumping behavior um and then
    it gets from the big jumps versus the repeated jumps where with the standing posture
    it&amp;#39;s a it&amp;#39;s like a continuous control problem so I&amp;#39;m standing
    here my feet are on the ground my base of support is a certain you know space
    and I&amp;#39;m continuously trying to keep my center of mass sort of within that
    base of support by using sort of a you know whatever I&amp;#39;m doing with my
    leg muscles in my sort of equilibrium sense um it&amp;#39;s a continuous overtime
    um behavior um this is different from something like a jump where a jump is a
    more of like a discreet momentary Behavior like there&amp;#39;s a period of time
    before there&amp;#39;s the thing itself and then there&amp;#39;s a period of time
    after so this is like the you know wind up this is the jump itself and this is
    landing so that unlike this one where sort of like you&amp;#39;re controlling
    it continuously over time with this one there&amp;#39;s like a discreet behavior
    that you&amp;#39;re doing once um in this case it&amp;#39;s jumping off the ground
    and so you know there&amp;#39;s all the physics there&amp;#39;s like the moment
    of liftoff there&amp;#39;s the moment of contact um but you know you could compare
    that to something like you know throwing something in the air um either throwing
    it and then catching it or just throwing it at a Target where that&amp;#39;s more
    of a Contin like a a discreet singular targeted behavior um where you know if
    I&amp;#39;m trying to throw this at a Target and hit the target I aim I set up
    I wind up I throw and then at some point the thing leaves my hand and then it&amp;#39;s
    off it&amp;#39;s out of my control um versus like a more of a pin the tail on
    the donkey where I might might be trying to like steer it in where I&amp;#39;m
    sort of controlling it the entire time um there&amp;#39;s kind of there&amp;#39;s
    there&amp;#39;s a lot of deeper layers there that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s one
    of those things that&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a very intuitive
    distinction but there&amp;#39;s a lot of differences once you start getting down
    to like you know thinking about this in terms of like Robotics and kind of like
    control systems this starts getting you into like continuous control starts getting
    into things like feedback control versus this more discreet control stuff gets
    you into like feed forward control and model based predictions and blah blah blah
    blah blah um none of which we&amp;#39;re really going to talk much about but just
    so you know those are the the Deep ER layers there um and also just in a distinction
    between like three biget jumps where I sort of wind up put everything I can into
    the ground land reset and then do it again versus a like repeated jump thing where
    it&amp;#39;s sort of a continuous process where the force of compression from
    Landing of the previous jump becomes the the force that will carry me on to the
    next one so there&amp;#39;s not that period of kind of like reset and reestablish
    um with the three big jumps you can you can look at each of them individually
    aside from like fatigue factors and stuff like that with things like repeated
    jumps they carry into each other so well that you can&amp;#39;t consider one without
    considering the thing that came before it so this is more you know I think like
    walking or running or juggling or some kind of like continuous Behavior running
    in particular also has this case where like you were coming off of the ground
    at discrete intervals and then the force of Landing from one step compresses is
    your the spring of your body which is what which is part of the energy that sort
    of bounces you into the next step um and yeah a lot of deep layers there there&amp;#39;s
    sort of at a layer of sort of the motor the neural control of like movement and
    motor control um there are distinctions and sort of thoughts about where different
    of these types of control may live in your cortex in your subcortex in your sort
    of spinal region and you know like the thing of like the the the compression from
    one jump leading you into the next one the the forces from one step setting you
    up for the next the step that comes after it that sort of stuff is very gets very
    close to the physics and the closer you are to the physics the sort of the lower
    in that motor hierarchy you tend to operate so a lot of things like Locomotion
    um are thought to have a lot of their control down like the spinal level like
    in spinal Central pattern generators um which are thought to be kind of you know
    like the upper the higher regions of your motor hierarchy kind of our our thought
    to the C remember speaking in cartoon terms kind of like they kick off a process
    that kind of then once it started it gets kind of like shunted down to the lower
    layers of your nervous system um so things like walking for example um as far
    as I understand haven&amp;#39;t checked in a while um the thinking it this is
    like one of my sort of pet questions as a grad student was like how much of things
    like how much of things like local motion are controlled by the motor cortex versus
    being controlled by like the lower lower levels of the nervous system and I believe
    the last I my my last I checked in my sort of you know in that exploration I think
    it was like when you start like gate initiation like when you start walking you
    see a lot of activity in the motor cortex but on but during like continuous Locomotion
    like when you&amp;#39;re walking from one part of Campus to the other you&amp;#39;re
    in you&amp;#39;re happily in Locomotion mode moving at a relatively constant preferred
    walking speed there&amp;#39;s not a lot happening in the cortex at that point
    like if you start getting onto like Rocky trains where you&amp;#39;re like picking
    your step it might show back up um but sort of the idea is that the motor cortex
    initiates the gate Behavior Uh terminates the gate Behavior so you start walking
    you come to a stop but during it sort of standard operation a lot of the basic
    control is handled by lower parts of your nervous system U and then your vision
    is kind of like I think it&amp;#39;s sort of it&amp;#39;s thought that a lot of
    that like the vision goes through subcortical Pathways like keep looking for tripping
    hazards and you know some like you know avoiding stepping on the stick type of
    stuff there&amp;#39;s some indication like keeping balance not falling over there&amp;#39;s
    some indication that that visual path it goes subcortical so it it doesn&amp;#39;t
    actually go into the pink wrinkly thing up top it kind of bypasses that um but
    now we are I think directly at the Forefront of how much we know about that kind
    of stuff so uh I&amp;#39;ll just leave it there great question um so there&amp;#39;s
    such a thing as the What&amp;#39;s called the startle response and it&amp;#39;s
    the thing that we all know it&amp;#39;s kind of like ah and I think that&amp;#39;s
    um that&amp;#39;s one of those places where like this the cartoon kind of starts
    to break down between like oh this part is controlled by the higher level this
    part is controlled by the lower level because things like a startle response it&amp;#39;s
    very basic like like all vertebrates startle and it&amp;#39;s one of those things
    like it&amp;#39;s triggered by these sort of like looming objects and sort of
    like oh no I&amp;#39;m slipping kind of things but so which would make you think
    that it&amp;#39;s sort of like a lower level of control but it has these sort
    of characteristics that that are more sophisticated than you expect like I&amp;#39;m
    falling I reach out and I grab something so whatever system is controlling those
    kind of like like startle responses and like balance correction responses has
    some access to like the things we tend to associate with the high levels um and
    so it&amp;#39;s just kind of it it starts to get like that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s
    one of like that&amp;#39;s one of those question question that you could ask the
    bot more like a lot about it and it would say a lot of things but I wouldn&amp;#39;t
    trust anything it says in the specifics because that&amp;#39;s the kind of question
    that&amp;#39;s like as an expert in that area I&amp;#39;m like ah that gets that
    gets complicated and murky and like try to find recent papers about it um you
    could probably find stuff in like rodents about strle responses but then when
    you start looking at stuff in humans just like the quality of research is it&amp;#39;s
    just harder to study that because we because it&amp;#39;s hard to study humans
    and you can&amp;#39;t crack them open so um but yeah sort of like that yeah that&amp;#39;s
    uh there&amp;#39;s some there&amp;#39;s a study that I saw that was looking at
    it was like walking in VR and every so often the VR world would just like rotate
    as if you were falling over and they measured like responses at like you know
    at the full body level at the muscular level stuff like that and they found that
    there were these responses in the ankle musculature that happened like 120 milliseconds
    after the perturbation which is way too fast to go through the visual cortex because
    that&amp;#39;s thought to be a much slower process um there&amp;#39;s also some
    like there people running on a treadmill and they sort of drop a plate that they
    have to step over and you see responses within like 5 50 to 50 to 100 milliseconds
    which again is kind of evidence that there&amp;#39;s a sort of like subcortical
    path subcortical meaning below the cortex so bypassing the pink wrinkly thing
    um but the these are cartoons these are never it&amp;#39;s never like we&amp;#39;re
    talking about like bundles of like millions of fibers of neurons like and we when
    we say oh it bypasses this part of the cortex we mean most of those fibers don&amp;#39;t
    project onto the cortex but you know if 20,000 fibers go back to like you know
    it&amp;#39;s like we&amp;#39;re talking in statistics here so it gets really murky
    really fast um so yeah I don&amp;#39;t know that&amp;#39;s like a great question
    that I don&amp;#39;t have a great answer to because I don&amp;#39;t think anyone
    does if there might be like some people who could give you like a few extra layers
    but very quickly you get into out of no space which is a great space to be that&amp;#39;s
    where all the work is okay cool any other thoughts questions yes great um so let&amp;#39;s
    look at standing the noblest of behaviors outstanding in our Fields um so first
    things first let&amp;#39;s look at actually first things first let&amp;#39;s take
    a moment to mourn the reality that we will never actually know the true answers
    to what it was that I was doing here here or here these are we are we going to
    be looking at and sort of thinking about and analyzing and sort of considering
    events that happened like last week they&amp;#39;re those they&amp;#39;re gone
    we are going to try to be making inferences about things like you know what was
    my muscular doing what was my nervous system doing where was the state of my body
    and sort of what was the mass distribution at different points in time these are
    the questions you want to answer but the reality is is that the true answer to
    those questions is lost it&amp;#39;s gone it&amp;#39;s like it it happened and
    then it then it&amp;#39;s gone dissolves into the past thermodynamic foam and
    all that good stuff and and so any questions that we might want to ask about it
    there there will be many questions we might going to ask about that where we can
    never know the answer to what that event of the past was um and the only reason
    why we can say anything about it is that we happened to have a empirical apparatus
    set up calibrated and recording and that recording was able to save some bare
    Shadows of data that we believe are correlated to the hypothetical true fact of
    the universe of what I was doing in this space in that point of the past um and
    this particular case the the data that we collected is in the form of videos um
    where a video is one of these things I don&amp;#39;t know if you&amp;#39;ve heard
    of them they&amp;#39;re great super useful um super dark so the recordings themselves
    were not not my greatest work sort of like some of the camera setups were not
    great it&amp;#39;s super dark um which I think you know so the Fidelity of the
    data that we&amp;#39;re getting is not going to be the best in the universe um
    but it&amp;#39;s fine enough um and so this is a video this is a record of the
    data that we recorded and the empirical measurement that this represents is samples
    from a particular cone of light from a particular location in space so a video
    it this is 30 frames per second which is pretty slow for scientific data but standard
    for most sort of videos that you encounter um 30 frames per second 720p uh hey
    hey calm down um so the video is let&amp;#39;s see 720p by 1280p 1280 yeah P meaning
    pixels so if you see things like HD high def 1080p by 1920 4K is like whatever
    whatever 1080 * 2 is divided by whatever 1920 X2 is and this is a raster plot
    a raster recording raster image where the 720 is if you count if you zoom way
    into these tiny little pixels and you count them there will be 720 in this direction
    and then there be 1,280 in that direction and at each of these little squares
    there&amp;#39;s actually three recordings one is in the red channel one is in
    the green channel one is in the blue Channel and the pixel itself represent a
    number between 0 and 255 which is 2 to 8 and if it&amp;#39;s zero it means that
    that tiny little section of that whatever sensor is on the back of the camera
    recorded zero intensities of photons um I guess the S would be Candelas I don&amp;#39;t
    really know how that works but this little the the number in this spot it will
    be between zero and some let&amp;#39;s even let&amp;#39;s not worry about the
    number let&amp;#39;s just say between zero and one if that seems too complicated
    to you we can say between 0 and 100% or 100% is the maximum value that that little
    sensor at that little section of this of the video was able to record so this
    is roughly speaking white so that&amp;#39;s going to be 100% active this is roughly
    speaking black that&amp;#39;s going to be 0% active so we get one of these images
    every 33 milliseconds which at the end results in a a weird thing called a video.
    MP4 where the before it&amp;#39;s just a file format it&amp;#39;s just like an
    instruction set that the computer uses to be able to turn this into something
    that our sort of primate eyes like to look at um yeah and then there&amp;#39;s
    three of them and sort of analogously to the way I&amp;#39;ve talked about Vision
    before and the sort of these truc moments where environmental energy gets transduced
    into sort of a different form of energy um and your eyes that&amp;#39;s light
    is gets absorbed by the opsin and converted into like electrochemical potentials
    or whatever in a camera the light is absorbed by some weird Crystal of silicone
    and then turned into a pattern of voltages that gets measured and recorded and
    converted into this picture and we believe that there&amp;#39;s something in the
    pattern of activation on the back of the camera sensor at the different time points
    of recording that is correlated with the reality of what&amp;#39;s going on in
    the real world um the reason why we believe that is because when we look at it
    we say yeah that looks like a person that looks not only does that look like a
    person it looks like the person that was standing in front of the camera at the
    time that I saw the person in front of the camera standing there and then the
    person pushed record so I look at it and I say yeah that seems right I think that
    I understand how cameras roughly work and it&amp;#39;s that sort of weird intuitive
    gut check of yeah this seems like a vaguely valid recording that&amp;#39;s the
    empirical basis of everything that&amp;#39;s going to come after this everything
    else I&amp;#39;m going to show you is going to be computations that happen on
    top of on the basis of these sort of Bas level initial empirical measurements
    and it&amp;#39;s kind of fun to talk about this in the context of like lowquality
    videos from webcams but I promise you every empirical investigation you do from
    here on out will have a similar form where there is some empirical measurement
    unless it&amp;#39;s like a computational study which a whole other thing um well
    whatever different thought um there will be some piece of equipment that you will
    have calibrated against some known value it will be recording some either a singular
    or a Time series of empirical measurements that you will have some degree of trust
    about whether or not that thing maps onto some true fact reality of the world
    which typically speaking will be some true fact reality of the world that has
    gone into the past and may or may not be able to be recorded again in this case
    you could record me doing the same behavior again but you will never again have
    the opportunity to record this particular moment in time so this is sort of just
    like practically speaking as a researcher um this is not particularly precious
    data because I can just always do it again if this was like a patient like a like
    an amputee that I had to recruit and they sort of came across town and they came
    and stand in front of the thing I did the recording and and if I did that one
    and it was too dark and I had the cameras kind of in the wrong spot that&amp;#39;s
    a much bigger bummer because that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s a much harder data
    recording to recreate but yeah so yeah learn your equipment learn your equipment
    because when you get to the place where you&amp;#39;re recording data you really
    care about you want to know all the ways it can go wrong um okay great so oh yeah
    I have some other technically speaking there&amp;#39;s another empirical measurement
    here which is in the form of the time stamps from the videos so I have measures
    of like the computer&amp;#39;s like sort of hypothetically nanc scale time stamps
    from each one of the recorded frames I don&amp;#39;t trust it down to NS but I
    do trust it down to like milliseconds microsc question mark who knows um this
    is another thing where if I deleted these time stamps I could also never recreate
    those timestamps because videos tend not to actually encode the specific time
    that the image was recorded they tend to just sort of say this is a 30 FPS video
    and then play it at 30 frames per second regardless of the variations in time
    so there&amp;#39;s a many many deeper layers of the freeo cap software which we
    will never bring up in this context relate to this stupid time stamp recording
    and getting everything nicely temporarily synced between the multiple cameras
    so so this is the base data videos from multiple locations um we also have this
    calibration data which tells us where the cameras were in space um so camera one
    was trip rotation translation is like position rotation is rotation put them together
    you have something like orientation 6 degrees of freedom and this is the positions
    of the cameras this is another one of those cases where if I didn&amp;#39;t have
    the calibration data for where those cameras were I can&amp;#39;t recreate it
    I I proba it would be very difficult to recreate I I actually if I really desperately
    needed to I could write some code that would allow me to reconstruct the camera
    positions um um without the the checker board just using a bunch of like like
    I could use like marks on the board and stuff like that but I really don&amp;#39;t
    want to do that so I consider this to also kind of be part of the base data here
    like if I hadn&amp;#39;t done the calibration or if I had done the calibration
    wrong um very difficult to recreate that um so like for example if I had if I
    was using like the wrong checker board or if I had like mistakenly had like another
    checkerboard in the background and not noticing it then that process would break
    and I would either have to come through and figure out how to fix it or record
    the data again this is a so this is another thing that someday this may come up
    in your life but my personal belief and advice to you is it is typically speaking
    a much much better idea if you record some data and it&amp;#39;s not good data
    learn the lesson and record it again don&amp;#39;t spend a lot of time trying
    to fix bad data if you could at all avoid it you can&amp;#39;t always avoid that
    but in general given the option just figure out what you did wrong and then record
    it again that&amp;#39;s my personal advice uh as a Del leaguered scientist okay
    so but let&amp;#39;s forget all those and just say the base data is the videos
    so if that&amp;#39;s the base data and then this is the other side of that equation
    this is the output data this is the approximation let&amp;#39;s turn off the the
    mesh which is mostly for visuals and let&amp;#39;s this is the that&amp;#39;s
    this guy that&amp;#39;s roughly speaking right this is the level of fidelity that
    we have reconstructed the the human body to um and look there was a lot of work
    that went into recreating it to this level like it was years of my life and years
    to come was to produce this data and I&amp;#39;m quite proud of it but also it&amp;#39;s
    garbage there is nothing like this is such an impoverished Recreation of this
    like this thing is like a couple chunks of wood um and I am several trillion cells
    and billions of neurons and you know thoughts dreams and histories and stuff like
    that um the feet here are just like solid blocks whereas my feet have this like
    very complicated muscular skeletal structure um and you know this thing doesn&amp;#39;t
    have any neurons it&amp;#39;s all very it&amp;#39;s extremely impoverished um
    but it&amp;#39;s the best we got yeah uh and then all of this ah this point is
    not worth the time I&amp;#39;m taking to make it yeah yeah and then this this
    is the actual data model that we&amp;#39;re looking at here this is the whole
    thing boiled down to a singular Center of mass it doesn&amp;#39;t even have rotation
    it just has position and so this is the it&amp;#39;s a long way to make it down
    to an extremely condensed form an extremely low dimensional representation of
    something that is reality infinitely dimensional you would require like like I
    don&amp;#39;t know how many numbers so this thing requires three numbers to perfectly
    Define its position and space at any moment in time I don&amp;#39;t know how many
    numbers it would take to Define me as a person at any moment in time but it&amp;#39;s
    a very very large number this thing I think 1 two 3 4 five 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
    14 14 * 3 42 so this is 13 joints three degrees of freedom this requires 42 numbers
    to Define at any moment in time um so yeah if you want to know questions about
    things like joint angles this is not sufficient um but if you&amp;#39;re just
    looking at things like Center of mass versus BAS of support it&amp;#39;s nice
    to have the low dimensional output and then I do that I&amp;#39;ll come back I
    do this it go away great okay so how do we get how do we sort of get from point
    A to point B here um well the first thing we have to do is just just like a little
    bit of magic just like a tiny a tiny chunk of magic um where by magic of course
    I mean some form of stochastic process involving machine learning these days in
    in year of Our Lord 2025 a lot of AI talk everywhere if you&amp;#39;ve been paying
    attention there&amp;#39;s been a lot of machine learning talk for quite a long
    time since then for as long as you&amp;#39;ve been alive easily um but you know
    I think if you&amp;#39;re looking for a specific date like 1986 rumel Hart and
    some other guy uh came up with back propagation which is a very important technique
    that basically makes uh neural networks sort of work um and so there lot so and
    everything since then it&amp;#39;s sort of now now everything has the term AI
    in it which is basically just like a marketing term that means a neural network
    that has language capacity um and this is kind of a problem like I obviously like
    AI we&amp;#39;re using in this class like a lot um but it&amp;#39;s a problem
    it&amp;#39;s a problem empirically because machine learning will sort of I think
    by definition involve some form of trained networks trained neural network where
    there&amp;#39;s some form of uh empirical data that gets smooshed together with
    some machine learning processes and it produces a neural network that produces
    an output of some kind so when you talk to the bot on Discord behind the scenes
    several several many layers behind the scenes the thing that&amp;#39;s actually
    producing the words that come back onto the to the screen and sort of feel like
    a a human a humanik response those words are being generated probabilistically
    from a neural network that was trained on language data um and importantly I&amp;#39;m
    saying probabilistically because the neural neural networks machine learning algorithms
    machine Learning noral Network based computations only operate in that probabilistic
    stochastic space they they do not do hard computation um that will give you uh
    deterministic responses so things so an example of a deterministic thing is like
    the distance between two points right you use Pythagorean theorem for that you
    know whatever is that X Y you know L sure and then L = the square &amp;lt; TK
    of x^2 - y^2 right that&amp;#39;s a^2 plus I don&amp;#39;t know Pythagorean theorem
    right so you want to measure the distance between these two points you can do
    this computation and it it is like a like you will always get the same number
    if you put it in the same numbers here um Mach uh machine learning algorithms
    neural networks any AI based solution as the marketing folks would like to say
    does not have that characteristic there&amp;#39;s always going to be some squishiness
    and stochastic aspect to it in this pipeline I have very carefully there is a
    there&amp;#39;s only a singular point in the process that involves a machine learning
    algorithm and it is this part right here it this the step of the process where
    we convert the video into something that&amp;#39;s a lower dimensional and directly
    related to the thing that we care about involves bit of jargon here um a convolutional
    neural network which is basically lives in the it&amp;#39;s a trained model that
    was trained on many many many hand labeled videos hand labeled images where people
    went through images of people and then marked out these are where the shoulders
    are this is where the hips are this is where the the the wrist is and so the the
    neural network and the convolutional part just means that it&amp;#39;s sort of
    like running this kind of like search pattern over the image looking for something
    so like the ankle detector is just looking for ankles at all times and when it
    gets down here it&amp;#39;s actually more it&amp;#39;s like a right ankle they
    have like a right ankle detector and a left ankle detector and so it says oh there&amp;#39;s
    probably an ankle in this part of the screen and then you take the peak of that
    probability curve you draw a DOT on it and then we say that&amp;#39;s where the
    ankle is um this is weird magic this is one of those things that like shouldn&amp;#39;t
    be possible and yet here we are um before 2007 it wasn&amp;#39;t sorry 2017 it
    wasn&amp;#39;t POS you couldn&amp;#39;t do this then in 2017 some folks from Carnegie
    melon published a paper called open open pose released a model called open pose
    um and it was the first it they were building on existing models and existing
    techniques and they produced an output that sort of could reliably draw a two-dimensional
    stick figure on a picture of a person in the screen if you just Google open pose
    now you&amp;#39;ll find the repo it&amp;#39;s a bit of a nightmare to use but
    very useful thing to come out um and so that is the the weird jumping technology
    that makes any of the rest of this possible because video has always been kind
    of been a very strange form of data because for us as visually gifted primates
    we are exceptionally good at looking at videos and extracting a lot of information
    and we you do that all the time every you&amp;#39;re look when you&amp;#39;re
    looking at a video you&amp;#39;re looking at a a rectangle of light flickering
    around and thinking oh yeah that that person is petting a cat that person is you&amp;#39;re
    riding a bike like you&amp;#39;re very very good at that and you can say you can
    tell you can say many many truth preserving things about an image with your giant
    human brain um so scientifically it&amp;#39;s videos been used for a long time
    but it&amp;#39;s always been very challenging to convert that sort of qualitative
    gut checky sense of what&amp;#39;s going on in the video into something that&amp;#39;s
    empirically grounded enough to actually do scientific investigations on it um
    historically one of the best methods that we had was hand coding so you would
    train a group of typically like undergraduates to look at videos um a lot of like
    developmental psychology um involves like just watching videos of babies doing
    stuff and having undergrads who just are like watching okay at time equals 12
    seconds the baby grabbed the toy at 13 seconds they handed it to the mom at 14
    seconds you know da da da da and so you have that sort of like manual labeling
    of videos as as the thing that produces the base data of like oh the you know
    babies like to reach to toys you know is this child looking at their mother and
    what&amp;#39;s the odds of sort of autism spectrum on the basis of like shared
    attention and da d da um so valid but obviously huge bottleneck like if if if
    if us for us to to look at this data if we had to give it to a human and have
    them hand draw points on the screen that&amp;#39;s a massive bottleneck but because
    of the Advent of that sort of convolutional neural network stuff we can now send
    our images at 30 30 frames per second from multiple cameras to the machine and
    it will draw the the dots on the screen and then critically for the sort of empirical
    validity of this thing that step which is the only sort of machine learning stochastic
    Magic Box step produces data that lives in the form of a stick figure drawn on
    top of a picture of a person so if you are trying to evaluate how well this thing
    did at drawing a stick figure on this image of a person you can tap back into
    that several billion years of evolution of your visual cortex to look at it and
    say oh yeah that&amp;#39;s doing a pretty good job and so now we even though we
    have the magic box step in our process we can gut check ourselves and sort of
    like regain some of the like the trust that we have in processes like Pythagorean
    theorem that we do not have when with processes involving a neural network or
    a machine learning algorithm or an AI or something like that so this is sort of
    part of the epistemology of it so epistemology study of knowledge study of you
    know like how do you how do you feel like you know things um and the reason why
    I trust this data is because the step of the process that I trust the least is
    visually verifiable and I have looked like I don&amp;#39;t because I I know this
    process well enough I no longer have to spot check all the videos to trust them
    um because I&amp;#39;ve done that enough that I can say okay this is a vaguely
    big word here not important term here uh this is a truth preserving process I
    believe that this step is not throwing fake into my computational engine so I
    now trust the output there&amp;#39;s a lot of there are other paid softwares that
    do marketless motion capture um and as far as I understand it most or all of them
    we don&amp;#39;t really know because they&amp;#39;re closed Source but I have
    like various people on the inside they have a step in their process where they
    use a machine learning algorithm to clean their data so where there&amp;#39;s
    like Jiggles and wiggles and like weird stuff going on they have a neural network
    that that is trained to clean that data for them and produce data that doesn&amp;#39;t
    have that noise in it that is a nontruth preserving process because you can&amp;#39;t
    spot check it but that&amp;#39;s okay for them because they&amp;#39;re generally
    producing this for like artists and stuff like that but you cannot do that if
    you want the data to come out scientifically and empirically valid um anyways
    moving on so um great so we&amp;#39;ve done this this is the high technology part
    this is the weird Magic Box part um and the output of that is where are we we
    crashing what&amp;#39;s going on great oh well so the output of that is going
    to be so let ignoring ignoring the face it&amp;#39;s going to be XY positions
    of I think it&amp;#39;s I forget how many there are like 32 not counting the face
    and hands I think there&amp;#39;s like 32 points in this particular uh stick figure
    guy um and so on each frame of each video there&amp;#39;s going to be 32 * 2 numbers
    produced and those numbers are going to be with an image 0 0 is at the upper left
    so you sort of you count you start here and you count that way um so that&amp;#39;s
    why we tend to think of X as this way and Y as that way but for image coordinates
    it&amp;#39;s X is this way and Y is that way so it it&amp;#39;s confusing because
    the top left corner is zero and then the bottom corner is 1280 so you count upwards
    going down you get used to it um this it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s like that
    so the Z is the depth plane into the thing um so X Y pixel X pixel y so for one
    frame for one joint you get you know the the position of that joint in two Dimensions
    with the units in this case are pixels um you then do uh once you have that two-dimensional
    data and you have you already have the position of the cameras that&amp;#39;s
    when you can do the triangulation step where you got camera One camera two so
    camera 1 2 3 this is me and then camera one sees the position of this there camera
    2 sees it there camera 3 sees it there and then using epipolar geometry which
    is you know this is like old school geometry um I&amp;#39;m not sure where epipolar
    geometry exactly what era that is from but this gets down to like similar triangles
    and like uid and like like like old school geometry um is how you sort of you
    do this kind of like triangulation math where you kind of like by because you
    know the position of each camera if you can if you can identify the location of
    the pixel from the point of view of that camera you can do the math and figure
    out the 3D location so the way to think about that is like imagine you&amp;#39;re
    standing on a a rooftop somewhere and you have a laser pointer and you&amp;#39;re
    pointing it at some Target you can know from your position it&amp;#39;s like okay
    I had to move like over this far and then down this far so you know the direction
    that that thing is in but you can&amp;#39;t tell how far away it is because your
    laser doesn&amp;#39;t tell you that so if you have a friend on another rooftop
    and they are also pointing their laser at that Target they know that I had to
    turn this way and down that way um they also know the the the direction of the
    target but they don&amp;#39;t know the depth so now imagine it&amp;#39;s like
    a foggy night and you&amp;#39;re standing on still another third rooftop and you
    can see those two laser paths and you can see where they cross over that place
    where those two lasers cross over that&amp;#39;s the position of the thing that
    that that&amp;#39;s that they&amp;#39;re targeting um and so if you know where
    those two people are in space and you know the direction that they&amp;#39;re
    pointing the lasers you can calculate the XY Z threedimensional position of the
    the the object in question and then again you do that 30 times per second uh several
    hundred times per frame and you get these numbers out so again this part is all
    this is all computation this is truth preserving math this is um yeah hard numbers
    hard math do the same thing you&amp;#39;d get the same number get the same answer
    every time um yeah and I guess I should say um assuming perfect data from the
    two-dimensional stuff the accuracy of this data is going to be dependent on the
    accuracy of your calibration so if you were off in the calibration then you&amp;#39;re
    going to be off in the position of the cameras and so you&amp;#39;re going to
    be off in the pedist position of the estimated position of the threedimensional
    object um that&amp;#39;s called what do we call that uh accumulating error it&amp;#39;s
    not accumulating error but yeah it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s whatever it&amp;#39;s
    you know the the the the verasity the truth value of this measurement derives
    its truthiness from the validity of the camera position estimation and the validity
    of the position in the image um yeah and let&amp;#39;s not even start asking questions
    around like when you say that my shoulder is here why is it here or is it here
    or is it here or is it here what what are we targeting there is it some anatomical
    thing is it the is it the muscle is it the meat is it let&amp;#39;s not even ask
    those questions yet um orever well maybe someday uh so uh now after all of this
    we have the on every frame why I look over there we have the 3D position of the
    body in space and it looks something like that not like that um so actually I
    wanted to see the mesh where is the mesh mesh mesh and so looking at this point
    that point and then the point over there triangulated gives you this point right
    here which is the XYZ position of my shoulder which in this particular case looks
    like its position is uh 1.6 M up and then 2728 M on the ground so I&amp;#39;m
    like roughly 1.8 m tall so seems to check out there um oh I didn&amp;#39;t mention
    there there&amp;#39;s a conversion into meter step that comes from the fact that
    I know the size of the squares on that board otherwise these would come out in
    like arbitrary numbers that are based off of like pixels and stuff like that actually
    it would come out in units of the size of the square on that board so at some
    point in the process I literally just multiply the numbers that come out of the
    triangulation by 58 which is the millimeter distance millimeter scale of that
    square and then divide that by a thousand and you get meters so roughly accurate
    but also for most of the things that I do in my life the number doesn&amp;#39;t
    super matter um like the specific units the number doesn&amp;#39;t matter what
    matters is like you know where is it on on frame one versus frame 10 and you know
    what&amp;#39;s the relative difference like this one is twice as many as that
    one and stuff like that um okay so now this is also one of those places where
    there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a certain intuition thing that I did which you
    may or may not have been offended by where I was talking about these computational
    measurements and then I said and here you go that&amp;#39;s the data and and I
    pointed to the output of what is clearly a visualization software this is not
    data in the sense of like I can&amp;#39;t do math on this this is like a DOT floating
    in space you can tell that it&amp;#39;s related to some like hard numbers which
    must come from somewhere but this is not the data this is a visual representation
    of the data which is a very very very useful thing to have but the actual data
    in this particular case lives in this such a thing let&amp;#39;s make this this
    type of a file called a CSV which stands for comma separated value uh which is
    here you go so Knows X knows y knows Z there&amp;#39;s a number there&amp;#39;s
    a comma there&amp;#39;s a number there&amp;#39;s a comma there&amp;#39;s number
    there&amp;#39;s a comma and there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot of these things
    there&amp;#39;s a lot of these numbers look at all these numbers oh boy and so
    we have and then so CSV is a very standard data format um you probably know it
    in its Microsoft proprietary form which is XLS which is an Excel spreadsheet an
    Excel spreadsheet under the hood just csvs with a bunch of for formatting um so
    in the same way that I rail against uh like what&amp;#39;s it called um a dockx
    file and I say I prefer things like markdown this is where I rail against things
    like xlsx and say I prefer CSV but it is also kind of annoying to view it like
    that um so we can open it and this is Libre office version of excel I don&amp;#39;t
    really use Excel or Excel like objects for anything um except for once or twice
    a year opening it up to show to a room full of undergrads and be like ooh look
    at all the numbers um default file format not whatever go to town um oh why am
    I looking over there um so again so libbre office cal um Microsoft Excel uh Google
    Sheets sheets um these are all applications that can that can slurp up um so CSV
    is comma separated value can also have tab separated value these are all just
    the limited values whatever doesn&amp;#39;t matter um and so this is just a nice
    format that takes the values where the columns are the names of one of the kinds
    of data that you have and then in this case the row is the frame number although
    I&amp;#39;m looking at this now it&amp;#39;s like this shouldn&amp;#39;t be there
    and there should be a column called frame number and another one called time stamp
    but we&amp;#39;ll get there um and yeah and then there&amp;#39;s as many rows
    as there are frames in the video and the reason why I like sort of pulling this
    stuff up is to do kind of like like this little journey we&amp;#39;re going on
    is meant to kind of do multiple things to your brain one is that there there should
    be a level of this that just makes total sense like it you know like sure maybe
    you know the the the geometry maybe don&amp;#39;t know the math you know maybe
    you&amp;#39;re not familiar with how convolutional neural networks work um but
    generally speaking it&amp;#39;s like okay sure like what you&amp;#39;re what you&amp;#39;re
    describing makes some vague kind of sense if I desperately needed to I could go
    through with a marker and just Mark frame by frame and measure the distance from
    the sides and the pixels and if I desperately needed to I could do that by hand
    I could go through and I could figure out this geometry and calculate It Out by
    hand I could do all that kind of stuff um but never in a 100 lifetimes could I
    do it this many times could I do it this fast and uh and I certainly couldn&amp;#39;t
    then take that and then draw whatever 392 images that I can then flip book from
    as many angles as I want so I can and look at the data and interrogate the data
    this is just long story short why computers are very useful things to have it&amp;#39;s
    not because they&amp;#39;re smart it&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;re dumb super
    fast like they can only do exactly what you tell them to do but they can do it
    very very quickly so for you for those of y&amp;#39;all who may encounter some
    depths of computers at some point in your life if you write program write code
    stuff like that um there will come a time actually out all of you there will come
    a time when you think man this computer is really either this computer&amp;#39;s
    really smart in which case it&amp;#39;s not humans were smart and they made the
    dumb box of rocks do very clever things um or you&amp;#39;ll get if you&amp;#39;re
    writing code you&amp;#39;ll be mad at the computer because it did something you
    didn&amp;#39;t want it to do I am here to promise you the computer did exactly
    what you told it to it followed its instructions precisely to the letter and if
    the output was not what you wanted it is in fact your fault so yeah so these are
    this is a big W of numbers and uh and that&amp;#39;s not even all of them um that&amp;#39;s
    just the body there are other similar data structures for the face the left hand
    the right hand and then still another for the Center of mass where this one is
    remember if I did that yeah so this is the center of mass data just the center
    of mass data and this one instead of being a big square of numbers this is just
    a three column Vector three column thing you still have the same number of rows
    as there are frames in the video but now there&amp;#39;s only Center of mass X
    Y and Z so it&amp;#39;s again we have when I say we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve
    decreased the dimensionality this is what I mean this is instead of being so 720
    by let&amp;#39;s see uh actually have 720 * 12 720 * 12 80 is 921 921,000 pixels
    per per image per frame per camera and so for each of those pixels you need three
    numbers to Define its its state because red green and blue um so we go from that
    unbelievably High dimensional data down to this much smaller um but still fairly
    intractable amount of data here uh actually really like I like this this here
    is a zoomed out picture of the full document so each of these columns is one of
    the data types there and so from all of that we go down even further to this there
    you go um and the nice thing about this is that my this starts to get to the place
    where your brain might start thinking yeah I can okay I can handle this this is
    more tractable this is something I can fit into my head um and and so and so from
    that place of kind of like mental comfort you can start asking scientific questions
    that sort of relate to the thing that you actually care about which is how does
    this thing stand up right let&amp;#39;s make some assumptions that somewhere between
    this hyper simplified model of the thing and the true facts of reality there is
    such a thing as a nervous system and that that that has such characteristics as
    peripheral and Central and motor hierarchy and cortex and cerebellums and brain
    stems and all that stuff let&amp;#39;s assume that this is sort of happening in
    in the context of all that sort of fancy Neuroscience stuff which luckily we in
    this room um we don&amp;#39;t have to do all that research ourselves because we
    can go and look at what other people have said about it we like I don&amp;#39;t
    have to do research on the cerebellum directly I can just read about the people
    who are doing the much more constrained kind of biological wetwear like let&amp;#39;s
    look at rabbits in uncomfortable positions sort of um like like like hardcore
    low-level reductionist neuroscience and I can incorporate what they tell me about
    these sort of n neural systems and subsystems into my attempts to understand and
    represent this data at a scale that&amp;#39;s just not amenable to that level
    of sort of like neural biological Precision let&amp;#39;s do it so okay so with
    all of that context I have 20 minutes left uh which I think is just barely enough
    time to kind of like make the main point of differentiation between the data from
    those two recordings um so before we do that I think that&amp;#39;s I think that&amp;#39;s
    enough time to do that anyone to have is there anything to say about all the nonsense
    I said before before this a lot of it&amp;#39;s kind of like intuition pump there
    a little bit of like there&amp;#39;s like a song and dance happening um again
    kind of in that space of like I&amp;#39;m trying to say a bunch of stuff that
    just makes sense and kind of you already knew at some intuitive level but just
    like making that very very specific point about the data flow and sort of the
    computational pipeline from the sort of empirical measurement in the form of this
    transduction of environmental energy into electrons and voltages and then the
    various sort of conversions and computations and calculations that we have to
    take that sort of Base data to to get it to the place where we can sort of start
    doing the actual Empirical research investigation and again let not sort of let&amp;#39;s
    not also shy away from the fact that I skipped an unbelievable number of steps
    at a lot of that part not just in the part where I&amp;#39;m actually doing the
    calculations myself but just in the basics of like how a freaking camera works
    like the I know vaguely how a camera works at an engineering level but not not
    that specifically let alone like how it sends signals down like a wire and that
    gets absorbed by the USB port which is handled by the USB Foundation which is
    some unknown cabal of probably hundreds to thousands of humans who have been working
    on how do you read data out of a voltage pin of a little rectangular port on a
    computer um for decades now then it goes into the computer and there&amp;#39;s
    CPUs and there&amp;#39;s RAM and there&amp;#39;s hard drives like the processes
    that go into all of this stuff this is why you know this is this is why like no
    human ever operates alone because we are all standing on each other&amp;#39;s
    shoulders and we are all using the lifetimes of Labor of other people in our vicinity
    to be able to with any luck ignore that part and focus on the things that we&amp;#39;re
    actually looking at Also let&amp;#39;s not speak about blender itself this visualization
    software which is an open source software that&amp;#39;s been developed in public
    by mostly volunteers for free since like 1993 um or python which is the code that
    I use to write the analysis code which is another open source project that&amp;#39;s
    been around for decades or any or any of the history of computation and sort of
    how we got to that point or the Metallurgy to make the stand or the plastic or
    the glass God even knows it&amp;#39;s overwhelming so we boil it down and we move
    on um yes great it&amp;#39;s the existential crises where the real learning happens
    okay here I am a fun little skeleton and let&amp;#39;s see let&amp;#39;s let say
    in range round frame let say 150 to 150 display custom color great okay so look
    at me go here I am I am standing this is this is Skelly this is Skelly skelly&amp;#39;s
    the logo freeat Foundation good job buddy um I have roughly similar bones in my
    body so there you go um and this is a mesh it&amp;#39;s sort of like a like a
    animation thing it&amp;#39;s not really data it&amp;#39;s more just for eyeballs
    but um this these are the rigid bodies so these are the um this the the simplified
    sort of Chunk segments that we&amp;#39;re going to call those parts of my body
    and then this is my center of mass calculated with those anthropometry tables
    talked about PR prior um and so and then this sort of red line here let&amp;#39;s
    make that pink yeah um this represents the vertical projection of that threedimensional
    point now you see the these terms like vertical projection and it&amp;#39;s sounds
    very mathy and complex it kind of is but also this is the ground let&amp;#39;s
    say the ground is where zero where Z is zero let&amp;#39;s just you could just
    Define anything the way you want let&amp;#39;s just say the ground is zero height
    so if I am here and I have x y z location let&amp;#39;s say Z is like whatever
    one or 1.2 height if I want to know the vertical projection of that thing I just
    say x y0 so that&amp;#39;s how I take the vertical projection of that I just set
    X I set the height to zero and now this has the same ground XY horizontal position
    but it&amp;#39;s just directly underneath the thing that I care about why do I
    want to see that it&amp;#39;s like well because I&amp;#39;m talking about balance
    whenever I talk about balance I keep using these terms like you know Center of
    mass and base of support in base of support is on the ground so I&amp;#39;m C
    I&amp;#39;m not I don&amp;#39;t really want to I don&amp;#39;t I can even I&amp;#39;m
    boiling this down even farther I can say I actually don&amp;#39;t care for this
    task for the jumping task I care very much about the height of it for the balance
    task I don&amp;#39;t care about the height at all I only care about its position
    on the ground plane so I&amp;#39;m going to project it down onto the ground plane
    and I want to compare it to the base of support where what is the base of support
    here um there&amp;#39;s a thing that&amp;#39;s supposed to make it show up here
    but I I just can never make that work maybe next semester um but in here very
    intuitively the base of support is where my feet are it&amp;#39;s the extent of
    where my feet are behold my base of support on the ground and so everywhere I
    can sort of yeah that&amp;#39;s where my feet go that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s
    the the the region of the ground where I can abser pressure and sort of change
    the forces to sort of affect my center of mass I can push it outside of my center
    of my base of support but when I do that I have to move my other foot or I will
    hit the deck um and for this task as we have defined it I told myself as a research
    participant that my goal was to lean without moving my feet so we can assume in
    this context that if my feet move then I have failed the task at hand and so we
    can assume that the the neural control that I&amp;#39;m exhibiting is in the service
    of completing that task so we&amp;#39;ve defined success and failure in this task
    again giving us a little bit more leverage to interpret this weird squiggly wiggly
    line here in terms of how it relates to things like balance and posture um and
    I&amp;#39;m going to say I&amp;#39;m going to say 300 z uh update I&amp;#39;ll
    paths great um so this the pink line now is showing the um the previous 10 seconds
    that&amp;#39;s too many bye going move his Bas of support no nervous system my&amp;#39;s
    fault um okay now I&amp;#39;m trying to I brought a mouse today because it&amp;#39;s
    hard enough to navigate these 3D spaces but with a trackpad it&amp;#39;s like
    Jesus Christ um so this is also so so I start out outside of the screen this is
    what we call invalid data this is not I didn&amp;#39;t do this you were all here
    if I did you would have noticed but this is what it happens when there&amp;#39;s
    nothing in the in the screen on the on the the the CSV thing this data looks just
    the same as the data where it&amp;#39;s actually like a stick figure it&amp;#39;s
    just not real um and so I come in and I say oh yeah then it snaps on top of me
    and let&amp;#39;s see here and so here I am I&amp;#39;m standing and leaning forward
    and there&amp;#39;s something oh let&amp;#39;s do it like that oh there we go
    and so I&amp;#39;m leaning all the way over it&amp;#39;s a little bit outside
    so there&amp;#39;s another layer of this where I&amp;#39;m like there&amp;#39;s
    a calculation here of like figuring out how to orient myself on the ground which
    I don&amp;#39;t 100% trust so I don&amp;#39;t 100% trust these data um but theoretically
    the theory predicts that I should be right at the edge of my foot when I&amp;#39;m
    leaning all the way this way um although again if we look at the data of what&amp;#39;s
    being traed on my feet it&amp;#39;s like okay but it&amp;#39;s a very very very
    impoverished model of the foot I have heel I have toe I don&amp;#39;t have this
    outer extent of my foot so even though I can put Force into the ground all the
    way out to here the data that we has show of my foot as just being a thin line
    on the ground and furthermore because you know this was not really made to be
    like a scientific software those predictions are going to be slightly different
    for each of the viewpoints of the cameras so there&amp;#39;s a whole layer upon
    layer of like how much do you trust things like the the the very specific data
    about like where the feet are versus the full body data of where the body is um
    but you know we kind of it&amp;#39;s like close enough um it&amp;#39;s also kind
    of hard because that&amp;#39;s hard for a lot of reasons um okay so generally
    speaking when you&amp;#39;re studying human behavior the harder the task is the
    easier it is to interpret because the harder the task is the fewer options are
    available that complete the task so if you assume that I can do the task then
    the harder it is the easier it is to interpret um so for example standing on two
    feet is easier than standing on one foot because of that the base of support is
    larger so making predictions about where the center that base of that Center of
    mass is going to be within that base of support necessarily more difficult CU
    you&amp;#39;re picking from a larger region uh when I&amp;#39;m on one foot the
    base of support is much smaller like this big and so the ability to predict if
    assuming that I&amp;#39;m successfully standing on one foot the ability to predict
    where the center mass will be in this region is easier because it&amp;#39;s a
    smaller region and there&amp;#39;s just there&amp;#39;s fewer things that I could
    be doing that would successfully complete the task because the task is harder
    and so in this case if we look here at this sort of nice moment where I&amp;#39;m
    standing on my right foot and you look at that vertical projection of the center
    of mass let&amp;#39;s see so here okay so 11:37 11:37 so from frame 1137 rice
    picked up my foot to let&amp;#39;s say 2058 uh so for these thousand frames I
    am standing over my right foot and what do you know the vertical projection is
    right over my right foot hooray science Works physics Works mechanics are true
    you can this isn&amp;#39;t enough to tell me about like my hip torqus like the
    center of Mass on its own isn&amp;#39;t going to tell me about things like my
    hip torque or my knee flexion and stuff like that but in terms of like the base
    level task of am I keeping my foot in the right location relative to my body to
    keep up right sure enough am and there we go and you can see again this is sort
    of like easy to belittle or easy to sort of not like like this is cool this is
    a cool thing just so you know this is very cool and uh and I&amp;#39;m proud of
    it so you&amp;#39;re welcome uh sorry sorry I said that um okay so base standing
    posture we could look at the left fo foot but I don&amp;#39;t really we&amp;#39;re
    running out of time very quickly and let&amp;#39;s assume for practical purposes
    that the left side of my body and the right side of my body are similar enough
    that we don&amp;#39;t have to care about the left side versus the right side um
    that&amp;#39;s not true because there&amp;#39;s handedness and footedness and
    I&amp;#39;m I think I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m better on my right foot than I am
    on my left foot or vice versa I can&amp;#39;t remember um but for the sake of
    expedience this is what it looks like when I&amp;#39;m standing under my own powers
    and my own sort of like anatomical base of support So prediction wise um how might
    this change is if if I&amp;#39;m holding something additional like something else
    outside of my body well you can ask the question what aspects of the description
    of this this physical model no longer apply when there&amp;#39;s something that
    I&amp;#39;m touching that&amp;#39;s outside of my body so there&amp;#39;s a lot
    of things one of them is that first thing that I said where my ability to put
    Force into the world to move my body is constrained to that where my feet are
    when I&amp;#39;m standing on the ground like this that my basis support is defined
    by my feet because that&amp;#39;s where I can put Force that&amp;#39;s Newton&amp;#39;s
    third law for every I put action in the world the world does a reaction pushes
    me back in this context that&amp;#39;s called the ground reaction force which
    is very very use useful you you use it every day um and so and so I say because
    of that constraint on my ability to put Force into the world sort of being attached
    to where my feet are um in order for me to stay upright I have to keep my center
    of mass above the base of support um if now I&amp;#39;m touching something else
    that thing that I just said is no longer true I can now get Force in reaction
    force from the table which is not noticeably where my foot is and also in this
    data recording I have no record of where the table was so if I&amp;#39;m looking
    at this I can&amp;#39;t make that same prediction about where the center of mass
    would be I can make a prediction about which direction I&amp;#39;m allowed to
    go out of that base of support from and which direction would require me to to
    fall over um real quick I&amp;#39;ll just say it though I don&amp;#39;t have any
    time uh 2015 they they had a DARPA robotics challenge bunch of bipeds walking
    around and they did sort of hilariously bad but it was still a big advance for
    the field um one of the things that they really struggled with was was calculating
    the reaction forces because they had really good sensors on the ground um but
    they didn&amp;#39;t have good sensors elsewhere so there was at least one case
    where one of the robots was like standing in a doorway trying to figure out what
    to do and they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re calculating the force it needs to put
    to sort of move in the right direction and they didn&amp;#39;t realize that its
    arm was touching the door frame and so when they&amp;#39;re calculating the forces
    that it needed they weren&amp;#39;t accounting for this force and so then when
    they tried to sort of make the right step it like it fell over and then had like
    a a a balanc response which was also wrong because that also didn&amp;#39;t have
    this calculated into it and then if you just Google 2015 darer robotics challenges
    there&amp;#39;s a lot of like really great blue reels of bipeds falling over dramatically
    and reminding us how how powerful of a motor you need to move something with such
    an incredible mechanical disadvantage anyway uh 3 minutes not enough time um but
    we&amp;#39;ll do it anyways real quick hopefully we can get this in um yeah Center
    of Mass sorry uh standing supported so this is now the other recording um same
    basic structure uh except now I am holding this stick and I&amp;#39;m holding
    it on my well let&amp;#39;s see where I&amp;#39;m holding it I think it was on
    my right hand and yeah so my right hand so I do I hide you I hide you I say I
    do this yes and I grab I don&amp;#39;t think we need the Tails um and so now we
    should be able to make a nice prediction especially because I was there we go
    so let&amp;#39;s see 1182 1182 to oh actually I do want that about 2,000 and I
    do want to put okay round frame uh 50 500 before zero after calculate the whole
    thing and display no key frames color is going to be green great and what do you
    know sure enough it&amp;#39;s on the outside of the foot so understandably before
    we said this it&amp;#39;s like oh we don&amp;#39;t really trust the locations
    of the foot to this high of level of fidelity which is a fair point but we also
    saw in that control condition that when I&amp;#39;m standing on one foot it&amp;#39;s
    pretty close to that like line between the heel and the toe and now that I have
    this unmeasured balance Support over here my actual base of support is no longer
    foot it&amp;#39;s foot plus little balance point over there and the reality is
    is that like you know I weigh like 200ish PBS of of person that&amp;#39;s a lot
    of force I can&amp;#39;t really put an appreciable percentage of that Force into
    that little little we weenie stick um so it&amp;#39;s not like the the the point
    is as good as the foot but mathematically I can pull some force from this direction
    so my my actual effective Bas of support is going to extend outside of my foot
    in the direction of that support uh and there you go empirical measurement result
    on the fly in person hooray and yeah okay that&amp;#39;s yeah cool feel good about
    that very close timing uh um we&amp;#39;ll probably talk about this just a touch
    more on next Wednesday and then we&amp;#39;ll do that uh that work that group
    thing um keep an eye on the Discord server if I announce anything but I probably
    won&amp;#39;t before Wednesday so thank you enjoy the rest of your lives thank
    you bye

    text: "Let's try that again. Okay, hello everybody, and welcome to this, I guess,\
      \ February. We made it to February, which is great; an additional month. Last\
      \ time, we recorded a bunch of data, and today we're going to look at it at\
      \ various stages of development. This is kind of the output of one of the recordings\
      \ that we can talk about. The semantic level, meaning, relates to meaning, and\
      \ syntactic relates to the structure. Before we do that, just a standard weekly\
      \ update on the status of my main project for the semester, which is making\
      \ sense of all the good data you\u2019ve been pumping into the machine. It\u2019\
      s again like a standard scrape of the server, recalculating stuff, and shoving\
      \ it into a zip file you can open in Obsidian.\n\nThis one is slightly different;\
      \ speaking of what I just talked about syntactically, these two are exactly\
      \ the same. They have all the same folders, all the same file names, probably.\
      \ But semantically speaking, this most recent one\u2014the user profile part\
      \ that kind of looks at what you\u2019ve been talking about and guesses what\
      \ your interests are\u2014only looks at your chats in the assignments category.\
      \ So, the stuff you\u2019ve been doing in class and any of the bot playground\
      \ stuff is not being used as part of that calculation. I didn\u2019t really\
      \ check it too closely to see how that changed things, but if you don\u2019\
      t mind, pop it open, take a look at yours, and hypothetically, it should be\
      \ a better match to what your interests are.\n\nAlso, you can check and see\
      \ if you have two chats in both places and it\u2019s only showing one. Let me\
      \ know from a bug report perspective, but don\u2019t stress too much about it.\
      \ We\u2019re not going to look at that right now, maybe sometime soon. I have\
      \ also been informed that I am required to give you an exam, so we\u2019re going\
      \ to do another chat thing, if that\u2019s going to be an exam. You\u2019ll\
      \ get a grade on whether or not you did it, but I think I\u2019ll put a little\
      \ more effort into the prompt to kind of ask you questions about your chosen\
      \ topic and relate it to the empirical stuff we\u2019ve been doing before. For\
      \ your topic, what are the units that are involved? What are the methodological\
      \ approaches? What do their measurements look like? What do their studies look\
      \ like? I\u2019ll be asking you those kinds of questions. The bot will interview\
      \ you about your chosen topic relevant to the conversations we've been having.\n\
      \nNow that you\u2019ve seen how this thing operates, it\u2019s not going to\
      \ withhold information. It will be asking you those questions but will also\
      \ be there to help, so if you don\u2019t know, just ask it and do yourself a\
      \ favor and look it up. On Wednesday, I have in mind another kind of group class\
      \ activity based on forming small groups and taking turns trying to find an\
      \ additional paper that\u2019s relevant to your chosen topic, and basically\
      \ trying to intentionally choose papers that are very dissimilar from the ones\
      \ you chose initially but still within the same domain in order to flesh things\
      \ out. After that session, I\u2019ll do the pseudo-exam chat thing in the following\
      \ week. \n\nSo, if anybody asks, it\u2019s an exam, and you\u2019re feeling\
      \ stressed and pressured to perform against your peers. Just make sure that\
      \ if anyone asks, you\u2019re being rank-ordered by human quality, which is\
      \ a bit disgusting. Cool, does that sound good? Anyone have any emotional outbursts,\
      \ thoughts, feelings? Great.  \n\nSo, last time we recorded, let\u2019s make\
      \ our way towards a review. A couple of times ago, we talked about units, space,\
      \ and topics like Euclidean geometry, three-dimensional stuff, and SI units\
      \ in terms of mass, kilograms, and seconds. I often notice that kilograms is\
      \ the SI unit, like a thousand grams; why isn\u2019t it grams? I think there\u2019\
      s some history behind how the units were selected; they picked a number for\
      \ the base unit gram, and later, decided that was too small, so they made it\
      \ a kilogram because it\u2019s more viable. Anyway, that\u2019s not relevant\
      \ to the present conversation.\n\nWe talked about mass, kilograms, seconds,\
      \ and derived units like Newtons\u2014like kilograms meter per second squared\u2014\
      and joules, which is kilogram meter squared per second squared. We talked about\
      \ pendulums as they swing back and forth and inverted pendulums in terms of\
      \ things that can be balanced above the ground through a minimally hinge joint\
      \ type of structure at the ground. While we\u2019re here, this is a nice model\
      \ of a person where these two things represent muscles in the ankle joint. This\
      \ is you trying to stand up. Look at you go! You\u2019re doing great! \n\nWe\
      \ laid all that stuff out in terms of the general study of human movement at\
      \ a holistic, human-scale type of approach\u2014not zoomed in looking at cells\
      \ or individual muscles\u2014much more zoomed out. Let\u2019s examine this physical\
      \ system to a level of fidelity that we can record and reconstruct. This software\
      \ is called Blender; it\u2019s animation software that\u2019s free and open-source.\
      \ You can download it. I\u2019ll endeavor by Wednesday to have the data we recorded\
      \ in a format that is easy for you all to download and look at. It\u2019s not\
      \ there yet, but I\u2019ll try to get that up by Wednesday so you can click\
      \ around. Based on your interests, I think Wednesday we\u2019ll focus on the\
      \ paper thing, but then later, we might have some more individualized work,\
      \ and you can decide if you want to dig deeper into this side of things.\n\n\
      In service of understanding and studying human movement in the natural world,\
      \ we are presenting that this sort of rough couple of square meters of space\
      \ is the natural world. This is my ecological niche, the space of the environment\
      \ where this particular organism operates, so it's valid. I\u2019ve spent a\
      \ lot of time in front of cameras, so there\u2019s not too much artifice there.\
      \ We recorded, looks like, five separate recordings. The first one is calibration;\
      \ that was the part where I set up the cameras. I showed it that grid-shaped\
      \ object of known shape and size, which is easy to track and can be used to\
      \ characterize the positions of the cameras and localize them in space. That\u2019\
      s a necessary thing. Calibration has that general idea where you set up your\
      \ equipment, then measure something you already know the answer to, which is\
      \ what I'm measuring. If there\u2019s a little more going on in this computational\
      \ step, that's the general idea with the principle being that if I use the tool\
      \ to measure something where I already know the answer, if it gives me the correct\
      \ results, it helps validate the process."

    text: "The answer that I know is right indicates that the tool is actually measuring\
      \ the world in a way that I care about. From there, I can move on to measuring\
      \ things in the world where I don't know the answer, such as how I am moving\
      \ around in space. We started with two matched conditions. This is like a little\
      \ mini baby experiment. The first recording was of standing balance, which sort\
      \ of serves as a control, and that was split into three phases: standing on\
      \ two feet, standing on one foot with my left foot, and standing on one foot\
      \ with my right foot. The more experimental condition, which is not particularly\
      \ exciting, is a classic case where I'm choosing an experiment where I am pretty\
      \ sure I know what the answer will be. I am trying to make a particular point\
      \ in relation to my theoretical description of the desideratum of my research\
      \ study, which in this case is the explication of the neural control of human\
      \ balance. I called this condition \"standing with support.\" These conditions\
      \ are matched in that I do all the same things in the experimental condition.\
      \ In the control condition, nothing is changed, but I forget the name of the\
      \ condition where something is manipulated. In this experiment, I am performing\
      \ the same behaviors, except now I am using a stick as a point of support. With\
      \ this difference in behaviors and the measurement fidelity that I expect to\
      \ obtain, and the theoretical framework of this strange idea that we can boil\
      \ down a human into a singular point mass, we can make predictions about behavior.\
      \ Then we can check those predictions against our data. I won't spoil the game\
      \ just yet, but I'll bet you can guess how these conditions will vary. Importantly,\
      \ for the standing on two feet condition, I didn't just stand straight. I leaned\
      \ as far as I could in all directions based on my internal sense of how far\
      \ I can lean without having to take a step to stay upright. There are two other\
      \ conditions: one which I call \"three big jumps.\" Putting \"three\" in the\
      \ title serves as a hint for me because eventually I want to chop this up into\
      \ smaller pieces, so reminding myself that there are three here helps me know\
      \ how many to look for. The second condition is repeated jumps for an undetermined\
      \ amount of time. I want to clarify that calling this \"three big jumps\" is\
      \ not necessarily a good way to name trials and record data; in fact, it's not\
      \ a good practice to bake that kind of stuff into the title. I am allowing it\
      \ here for my own convenience, and you can do it too. You will discover through\
      \ practice why it's not a good idea, and I\u2019ll leave that as an exercise\
      \ for the future. Great, do we feel caught up and aware of the situation? Wonderful.\
      \ I will leave that there. Today, I think I will focus on the two standing conditions;\
      \ we will see how far we get with that. We previously showed the jumping data\
      \ from last time, at least the big jump data, but we will get back to it. There\
      \ is one more distinction I want to highlight here, and this is less about the\
      \ data we recorded and more about a difference between these behaviors. Specifically,\
      \ the balance and posture behavior versus jumping behavior is important to note.\
      \ Big jumps versus repeated jumps illustrate this distinction. With standing\
      \ posture, it is a continuous control problem. I am standing here, my feet are\
      \ on the ground, and my base of support is a certain area. I am continuously\
      \ trying to keep my center of mass within that base of support by using my leg\
      \ muscles and my equilibrium sense. This is a continuous behavior over time.\
      \ In contrast, jumping is more of a discrete, momentary behavior. There is a\
      \ period of time before the jump, the jump itself, and then the landing. So\
      \ unlike standing, which is a continuous control task, jumping involves a discrete\
      \ action performed just once, in this case, jumping off the ground. You can\
      \ also compare jumping to throwing something in the air, either throwing and\
      \ catching it or throwing it at a target. Throwing is a discrete, singular targeted\
      \ behavior: if I am trying to hit a target, I aim, set up, wind up, throw, and\
      \ then the object leaves my hand and is out of my control, whereas controlling\
      \ something like a pin in a tail on a donkey is more continuous. There are many\
      \ deeper layers to this distinction, which is quite intuitive; however, significant\
      \ differences arise when considering it in terms of robotics and control systems.\
      \ Continuous control pertains to feedback mechanisms, whereas discrete control\
      \ relates to feedforward control and model-based predictions, and so on. We\
      \ will not delve deeply into that, but I wanted to point out those deeper layers.\
      \ Also, in the distinction between the three big jumps, where I put everything\
      \ I can into the ground to land, reset, and then do it again, versus the repeated\
      \ jump, the former is about resetting and reestablishing after each jump. With\
      \ repeated jumps, the force of landing from one jump becomes the force that\
      \ carries me into the next one without that reset period. Repeated jumps are\
      \ more akin to walking, running, or juggling\u2014some continuous behavior.\
      \ Running, in particular, shares this characteristic, where you come off the\
      \ ground at discrete intervals, and the force of landing from one step compresses\
      \ your body like a spring, providing part of the energy to bounce you into the\
      \ next step. There are many deep layers here. At the motor level, distinctions\
      \ exist regarding the neural control of movement. There are thoughts about where\
      \ different types of control may be located in the cortex and subcortex. The\
      \ compression from one jump leading you into the next jump, and the forces from\
      \ one step setting you up for the subsequent step, are closely tied to the physics\
      \ involved. The closer you are to the physics, the lower in the motor hierarchy\
      \ you operate. Many locomotor actions are thought to be controlled predominantly\
      \ at the spinal level, specifically in spinal central pattern generators, which\
      \ are thought to operate this way."

    text: "You know, like the upper, the higher regions of your motor hierarchy kind\
      \ of activate a process, and once it starts, it gets shunted down to the lower\
      \ layers of your nervous system. Things like walking, for example, as far as\
      \ I understand\u2014I haven't checked in a while\u2014this is one of my sort\
      \ of pet questions as a grad student: how much of things like locomotion are\
      \ controlled by the motor cortex versus being controlled by the lower levels\
      \ of the nervous system? I believe the last time I checked during my exploration,\
      \ it was when you start gait initiation, like when you start walking, you see\
      \ a lot of activity in the motor cortex, but during continuous locomotion, like\
      \ when you're walking from one part of campus to the other, you\u2019re happily\
      \ in locomotion mode, moving at a relatively constant preferred walking speed,\
      \ there's not a lot happening in the cortex at that point. If you start getting\
      \ onto rocky terrain where you're picking your steps, it might show back up.\
      \ But the idea is that the motor cortex initiates the gait behavior and terminates\
      \ the gait behavior; you start walking and then come to a stop. However, during\
      \ standard operation, a lot of the basic control is handled by the lower parts\
      \ of your nervous system. Your vision plays a role as well; it's thought that\
      \ much of the visual information goes through subcortical pathways, looking\
      \ for tripping hazards and avoiding stepping on sticks, for example. There's\
      \ some indication that to keep balance and not fall over, that visual pathway\
      \ goes subcortical, meaning it doesn't actually go into the cortex; it bypasses\
      \ it. We're currently at the forefront of how much we know about that kind of\
      \ stuff. I'll just leave it there. Great question. There\u2019s something called\
      \ the startle response, which is a reaction we all know; it's kind of like a\
      \ sudden jump. That's one of those areas where the cartoon model starts to break\
      \ down between higher-level and lower-level control. The startle response is\
      \ very basic; all vertebrates startle, and it\u2019s triggered by looming objects\
      \ or slipping sensations. This would imply it's controlled at a lower level,\
      \ but it has characteristics that suggest more sophistication than expected.\
      \ For example, if you\u2019re falling, you might reach out and grab something.\
      \ So whatever system controls those startle responses and balance correction\
      \ has some access to higher-level functions. It's one of those questions that\
      \ could prompt a lot of discussion with an AI, but I wouldn\u2019t trust the\
      \ specifics because that topic is complex and murky. If you looked for recent\
      \ papers on it, you could probably find research on startle responses in rodents,\
      \ but studying humans is more challenging because we can't dissect human brains.\
      \ There\u2019s a study I saw about walking in virtual reality (VR) where, occasionally,\
      \ the VR world would rotate as if you were falling over. They measured responses\
      \ at the full-body and muscular levels and found that there were responses in\
      \ the ankle musculature around 120 milliseconds after the perturbation, which\
      \ is too fast to be processed through the visual cortex since that\u2019s thought\
      \ to be a slower process. There are also treadmill experiments where they drop\
      \ a plate that participants have to step over, and responses appear within 50\
      \ to 100 milliseconds, indicating a subcortical pathway. However, these discussions\
      \ are still simplifications, as we are talking about bundles of millions of\
      \ fibers of neurons. When we say something bypasses a part of the cortex, we\
      \ mean most fibers don\u2019t connect to it, though some still do. It\u2019\
      s statistics, and it gets murky quickly. So, while that\u2019s a great question,\
      \ I don\u2019t have a definitive answer because I don't think anyone does. There\
      \ might be a few people who could provide extra insights, but you quickly get\
      \ into uncertain territory, which is fine; that\u2019s where a lot of the work\
      \ is. Cool, any other thoughts or questions? Yes, great. So let\u2019s look\
      \ at standing, the noblest of behaviors, standing in our fields. First things\
      \ first, let\u2019s take a moment to mourn the reality that we will never truly\
      \ know what was happening here or here. These are events we are going to think\
      \ about and analyze, but the truth is, the answers to those questions are lost\
      \ to time; they're gone. It\u2019s like they happened, and then dissolved into\
      \ the past. Any questions we might have about those events will remain unanswered.\
      \ The only reason we can say anything is that we set up an empirical apparatus,\
      \ calibrated it, and recorded data that we believe correlate with what was happening\
      \ at that moment in the past. In this particular case, the data we collected\
      \ is in the form of videos. A video is one of those things; I don\u2019t know\
      \ if you\u2019ve heard of them; they're great and super useful. However, the\
      \ recordings weren\u2019t my greatest work, as some of the camera setups weren\u2019\
      t ideal, and it was super dark, so the fidelity of the data is not going to\
      \ be the best in the universe, but it\u2019s good enough. This video represents\
      \ samples from a particular cone of light from a certain location in space.\
      \ The video runs at 30 frames per second, which is pretty slow for scientific\
      \ data but standard for most videos. It\u2019s 720p\u2014for context, 720p means\
      \ 720 pixels in height and 1280 pixels in width. If you see terms like HD (high\
      \ definition), 1080p by 1920 refers to a higher resolution, and 4K has even\
      \ greater specifications. This is a raster plot, a raster recording; the 720\
      \ is if you zoom way in, and if you count those tiny pixels, you will find 720\
      \ in that direction and 1280 in the other direction."

    text: "At each of these little squares, there are actually three recordings: one\
      \ in the red channel, one in the green channel, and one in the blue channel.\
      \ The pixel itself represents a number between 0 and 255, which is 2 to the\
      \ 8th power. If it's zero, it means that that tiny little section of whatever\
      \ sensor is on the back of the camera recorded zero intensities of photons.\
      \ I guess the unit would be Candelas; I don\u2019t really know how that works.\
      \ But the number in this spot will be between zero and some value, let\u2019\
      s say between zero and one. If that seems too complicated to you, we can say\
      \ it is between 0 and 100%, where 100% is the maximum value that little sensor\
      \ was able to record at that area of the video. So, roughly speaking, white\
      \ represents 100% active, and black represents 0% active. We get one of these\
      \ images every 33 milliseconds, which results in a file format called MP4. Before\
      \ it\u2019s just a file format, it serves as an instruction set that the computer\
      \ uses to turn this into something that our sort of primate eyes like to look\
      \ at.\n\nThere are three of these channels, and analogously to the way I\u2019\
      ve talked about vision before, there are these moments where environmental energy\
      \ gets transduced into a different form of energy. In your eyes, light is absorbed\
      \ by opsin and converted into electrochemical potentials. In a camera, the light\
      \ is absorbed by some crystal of silicone and then turned into a pattern of\
      \ voltages that gets measured, recorded, and converted into a picture. We believe\
      \ that there is something in the pattern of activation on the back of the camera\
      \ sensor at different time points of recording that is correlated with the reality\
      \ of what\u2019s going on in the real world. The reason we believe this is because\
      \ when we look at the footage, we recognize that it resembles a person. Not\
      \ only does it look like a person, but it looks like the person who was standing\
      \ in front of the camera at the time of the recording.\n\nThis idea is confirmed\
      \ when, after pushing record, we can observe the captured content, and we say,\
      \ 'Yeah, that seems right.' I think I understand roughly how cameras work. This\
      \ intuitive gut check tells us that this seems like a valid recording. That\
      \ serves as the empirical basis for everything that\u2019s going to come after\
      \ this. Everything else I\u2019m going to show you consists of computations\
      \ based on these initial empirical measurements.\n\nIt's kind of fun to talk\
      \ about this in the context of low-quality videos from webcams, but I assure\
      \ you every empirical investigation you do moving forward will have a similar\
      \ structure. There will be some empirical measurement, unless it\u2019s a computational\
      \ study, which is a whole different topic. There will be some piece of equipment\
      \ that you\u2019ve calibrated against a known value, recording either a singular\
      \ or a time series of empirical measurements for which you have some degree\
      \ of trust regarding their mapping onto a true fact of reality. Typically, this\
      \ is a fact from the past that may or may not be recorded again.\n\nIn this\
      \ case, I could record myself performing the same behavior again, but I could\
      \ never revisit this precise moment in time. Practically speaking, as a researcher,\
      \ this is not particularly precious data because I can replicate it. If this\
      \ involved a patient, like an amputee who came from across town to stand in\
      \ front of the camera, and I recorded the session with poor lighting or from\
      \ an incorrect position, that would be a much bigger issue as it would be harder\
      \ to recreate that data.\n\nTherefore, learn your equipment. When you reach\
      \ the point of recording data that you really care about, it\u2019s vital to\
      \ understand how things can go wrong.\n\nAnother empirical measurement here\
      \ is in the form of time stamps from the videos. I have measures from the computer's\
      \ hypothetical nanosecond-scale time stamps for each recorded frame. I don\u2019\
      t trust them down to nanoseconds, but I do trust them to milliseconds. If I\
      \ deleted these time stamps, I could never recreate them because videos do not\
      \ typically encode the exact time an image was recorded. They usually indicate\
      \ that it\u2019s a 30 FPS video and play it at that rate, regardless of variations\
      \ in time. There are many deeper layers to the free capture software related\
      \ to timestamp recording and achieving synchronized temporal alignment between\
      \ multiple cameras. \n\nSo, the base data comprises videos from multiple locations,\
      \ along with calibration data that indicates the cameras' positions in space.\
      \ For example, camera one underwent translation and rotation. When combined,\
      \ this gives us something like orientation or six degrees of freedom in terms\
      \ of the camera's positions. This is another case where, without calibration\
      \ data, recreating it would be very difficult. I could potentially write code\
      \ to reconstruct the camera positions without the checkerboard, using marks\
      \ on the board, but I really prefer not to do that, as it complicates things.\
      \ Thus, I consider this part of the base data; if I hadn\u2019t performed the\
      \ calibration, or if I had done it incorrectly, recreating that data would be\
      \ very challenging.\n\nFor instance, if I used the wrong checkerboard or mistakenly\
      \ included another checkerboard in the background without noticing it, the calibration\
      \ process would fail. I would then have to navigate the issue or record the\
      \ data again. This is a common scenario you might encounter in your work, but\
      \ my personal belief and advice to you is that it\u2019s generally a better\
      \ idea to record data and realize it\u2019s not good data, learn from that,\
      \ and then record it again. Don\u2019t waste too much time trying to fix bad\
      \ data if you can avoid it. While sometimes you cannot, generally speaking,\
      \ when given the option, figure out what went wrong and record it again. That\u2019\
      s my personal advice as a beleaguered scientist.\n\nSo, to summarize, if the\
      \ base data consists of the videos, then there is also output data based on\
      \ this. Let\u2019s turn off the mesh, which is mainly for visuals. This is the\
      \ level of fidelity to which we have reconstructed the human body. There was\
      \ significant work involved in achieving this level; it required years of effort,\
      \ and I am quite proud of it. However, I also recognize that it is limited;\
      \ this representation is such an impoverished recreation of a complex entity.\
      \ I am made up of several trillion cells and billions of neurons, along with\
      \ thoughts, dreams, and histories. The feet here are just solid blocks, whereas\
      \ my feet have a complicated musculoskeletal structure. This representation\
      \ lacks neurons and is extremely simplified; however, it's the best we have\
      \ at this moment."

    text: "This point is not worth the time I\u2019m taking to make it. This is the\
      \ actual data model that we\u2019re looking at here; this is the whole thing\
      \ boiled down to a singular center of mass. It doesn\u2019t even have rotation;\
      \ it just has position. It's a long way to make it down to an extremely condensed\
      \ form, an extremely low-dimensional representation of something that is infinitely\
      \ dimensional. You would require, I don\u2019t know how many numbers. This thing\
      \ requires three numbers to perfectly define its position in space at any moment\
      \ in time. I don\u2019t know how many numbers it would take to define me as\
      \ a person at any moment in time, but it\u2019s a very, very large number. This\
      \ thing, I think, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,\
      \ eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, and that\u2019s fourteen times three,\
      \ which is forty-two. So, this has thirteen joints with three degrees of freedom;\
      \ this requires forty-two numbers to define at any moment in time. So, if you\
      \ want to know questions about things like joint angles, this is not sufficient.\
      \ But if you\u2019re just looking at things like center of mass versus base\
      \ of support, it\u2019s nice to have the low-dimensional output.\n\nNow, how\
      \ do we get from point A to point B here? Well, the first thing we have to do\
      \ is a little bit of magic. By magic, of course, I mean some form of stochastic\
      \ process involving machine learning. In the year of our Lord 2025, there\u2019\
      s a lot of AI talk everywhere if you've been paying attention. There\u2019s\
      \ been a lot of machine learning talk for quite a long time, as long as you\u2019\
      ve been alive. If you\u2019re looking for a specific date, like 1986, Rumelhart\
      \ and some other individuals came up with backpropagation, which is a very important\
      \ technique that basically makes neural networks function. Since then, everything\
      \ has had the term AI in it, which basically has become a marketing term that\
      \ means a neural network that has language capacity. This is kind of a problem.\
      \ I obviously like AI; we\u2019re using it in this class a lot, but it\u2019\
      s a problem empirically because machine learning, I think by definition, involves\
      \ some form of trained networks, trained neural networks, where there\u2019\
      s some form of empirical data that gets combined with machine learning processes,\
      \ and it produces a neural network that yields some type of output. So, when\
      \ you talk to the bot on Discord, behind the scenes, several layers into the\
      \ model, the thing that\u2019s actually producing the words that come back onto\
      \ the screen, which feel like a human response, those words are being generated\
      \ probabilistically from a neural network that was trained on language data.\n\
      \nImportantly, I\u2019m saying probabilistically because machine learning algorithms,\
      \ neural networks, and machine learning-based computations only operate in that\
      \ probabilistic, stochastic space. They do not do hard computation that will\
      \ give you deterministic responses. For example, a deterministic computation\
      \ is like the distance between two points. You would use the Pythagorean theorem\
      \ for that\u2014whatever is the x and y coordinates. Then, L equals the square\
      \ root of (x\xB2 + y\xB2). That\u2019s how you measure the distance between\
      \ these two points; you can perform this computation and you will always get\
      \ the same number if you input the same numbers.\n\nMachine learning algorithms,\
      \ neural networks, and any AI-based solution, as the marketing folks would like\
      \ to say, do not have that characteristic; there\u2019s always going to be some\
      \ variability and stochastic aspect to it. In this pipeline, I have very carefully\
      \ structured it; there is only a singular point in the process that involves\
      \ a machine learning algorithm, and it is this part right here\u2014the step\
      \ of the process where we convert the video into something that\u2019s lower\
      \ dimensional and directly related to the aspect we care about. This involves\
      \ some jargon: a convolutional neural network, which is a trained model developed\
      \ from many hand-labeled videos and images, where people went through images\
      \ of people and marked where the shoulders, hips, and wrists are. The convolutional\
      \ part just means it\u2019s running a search pattern over the image looking\
      \ for specific features. For instance, the ankle detector is constantly looking\
      \ for ankles; when it finds one, it identifies whether it\u2019s a right or\
      \ left ankle, marking its position based on the peak of a probability curve.\
      \ This represents where the ankle is.\n\nThis technology seems like magic; it\
      \ shouldn\u2019t be possible, yet here we are. Before 2017, it wasn\u2019t possible\
      \ to do this. In 2017, some folks from Carnegie Mellon published a paper called\
      \ OpenPose, which released a model that could reliably draw a two-dimensional\
      \ stick figure on a picture of a person. If you Google OpenPose now, you\u2019\
      ll find the repository; it\u2019s a bit of a nightmare to use, but it\u2019\
      s a very useful tool. This is the innovative technology that makes the rest\
      \ of this possible because video has always been a peculiar form of data. As\
      \ visually gifted primates, we are exceptionally adept at looking at videos\
      \ and extracting a lot of information; you do this constantly. When you look\
      \ at a video, you're viewing a rectangle of light flickering and you articulate,\
      \ \"Oh, that person is petting a cat,\" or \"That person is riding a bike.\"\
      \ You can extract many truth-preserving statements about an image using your\
      \ cognitive abilities.\n\nScientifically, video has been used for a long time,\
      \ but it\u2019s always been challenging to convert that qualitative gut feeling\
      \ about what\u2019s happening into something empirical enough for scientific\
      \ investigation. Historically, one of the best methods we had was hand coding,\
      \ where we would train a group of typically undergraduate students to look at\
      \ videos. A lot of developmental psychology involves watching recordings of\
      \ babies doing various things, and having undergraduates would label the videos:\
      \ \u201CAt time equals twelve seconds, the baby grabbed the toy; at thirteen\
      \ seconds, they handed it to the mom,\u201D and so on. This manual labeling\
      \ of videos produced the foundational data about behaviors, like whether babies\
      \ like to reach for toys, or how shared attention relates to the likelihood\
      \ of being on the autism spectrum.\n\nWhile valid, this method is obviously\
      \ a huge bottleneck. If we had to give that data to a human who manually drew\
      \ points on the screen, that would be massively time-consuming. However, because\
      \ of the advent of convolutional neural network technology, we can now send\
      \ our images at thirty frames per second from multiple cameras to the machine,\
      \ and it will draw the dots on the screen. Critically, for the empirical validity\
      \ of this process, produces data that represents a stick figure drawn on top\
      \ of a picture of a person."

      \ is also one of those places where there's a certain intuitive thing that I\
      \ mentioned, which you may or may not have found offensive. I was talking about\
      \ these computational measurements and then I said, \"Here you go, that\u2019\
      s the data,\" and I pointed to the output of what is clearly visualization software.\
      \ This is not data in the sense that I can\u2019t do math on this. This is like\
      \ a dot floating in space. You can tell that it\u2019s related to some hard\
      \ numbers which must come from somewhere, but this is not the data; this is\
      \ a visual representation of the data, which is very useful to have. However,\
      \ the actual data in this particular case exists in a file type called CSV,\
      \ which stands for Comma Separated Values. Here you go, this file includes X,\
      \ Y, and Z coordinates; there\u2019s a number, a comma, another number, a comma,\
      \ a number, and so on. There are a lot of these numbers\u2014look at all these\
      \ numbers!\n\nSo, CSV is a very standard data format. You probably know it in\
      \ its Microsoft proprietary form, which is XLS, as in an Excel spreadsheet.\
      \ An Excel spreadsheet is just a CSV with additional formatting. In the same\
      \ way that I rant against, for example, DOCX files and say I prefer things like\
      \ Markdown, I similarly prefer CSV over XLSX, although it can be a bit annoying\
      \ to view it like that. We can open it, and this is a LibreOffice version of\
      \ Excel. I don't really use Excel or Excel-like applications for anything except\
      \ once or twice a year when I open it to show students and say, \"Ooh, look\
      \ at all the numbers.\" The default file format is not whatever; go to town.\n\
      \nOh, why am I looking over there? So, again, LibreOffice Calc, Microsoft Excel,\
      \ Google Sheets\u2014these are all applications that can handle CSV. Comma Separated\
      \ Values can also be Tab Separated Values; these are just different ways to\
      \ format values. It doesn't matter. Essentially, this is a nice format that\
      \ takes the values where the columns are the names of one of the kinds of data\
      \ you have. In this case, the row refers to the frame number, although looking\
      \ at this now, it seems this should not be here, and there should be a column\
      \ called frame number and another called timestamp, but we'll get there.\n\n\
      There are as many rows as there are frames in the video. One reason I like pulling\
      \ this stuff up is to embark on this little journey. It's meant to stimulate\
      \ multiple aspects of your brain. There should be a level of this that makes\
      \ total sense. You might understand the geometry even if you don\u2019t know\
      \ the math; for instance, if you\u2019re not familiar with how convolutional\
      \ neural networks work. But generally speaking, it\u2019s intuitive. If I really\
      \ needed to, I could go through with a marker and manually measure the distance\
      \ from the sides and the pixels frame by frame. If absolutely necessary, I could\
      \ calculate this geometry by hand. However, never in a hundred lifetimes could\
      \ I do it this many times or this quickly. And I certainly couldn\u2019t take\
      \ that and then draw whatever 392 images I can flip through from as many angles\
      \ as I want, then look at the data and interrogate it. This is, to sum up, why\
      \ computers are incredibly useful. They're not smart; they're just fast at following\
      \ instructions\u2014they can only do exactly what you tell them to do, but they\
      \ do it very quickly.\n\nFor those of you who may encounter some depth in computers\
      \ at some point in your life\u2014if you write programs or code\u2014there will\
      \ come a time when you might think, \"Man, this computer is really smart.\"\
      \ However, it\u2019s not; the humans were smart and made a dumb box of rocks\
      \ perform clever tasks. Alternatively, if you\u2019re writing code, you may\
      \ get frustrated at the computer because it did something you didn\u2019t want\
      \ it to do. I promise you, the computer did exactly what you told it to; it\
      \ followed its instructions to the letter. If the output was not what you wanted,\
      \ it is indeed your fault.\n\nSo, these are a lot of numbers, and that\u2019\
      s not even all of them; that\u2019s just the body data. There are other similar\
      \ data structures for the face, left hand, and right hand, as well as another\
      \ for the center of mass. Now remember how I showed that? This is the center\
      \ of mass data. This one instead of being a large grid of numbers has just a\
      \ three-column vector. There\u2019s still the same number of rows as there are\
      \ frames in the video, but now there's only center of mass X, Y, and Z. We have\
      \ effectively reduced dimensionality. Instead of a high-dimensional data set\
      \ that looks like 720 by 1280 (which amounts to 921,600 pixels per image), where\
      \ each pixel requires three numbers to define its state (red, green, blue),\
      \ we now go from that incredibly high-dimensional data to a much smaller, yet\
      \ still fairly extensive, amount of data. Here is a zoomed-out picture of the\
      \ full document. Each of these columns represents one of the data types.\n\n\
      From all that, we continue to refine it even further, and this offers a nice\
      \ format where your brain might start to think, \"Yeah, I can handle this. This\
      \ is more manageable, something I can fit into my head.\" From this place of\
      \ relative mental comfort, you can start asking scientific questions that relate\
      \ to the things you actually care about\u2014how does this thing stand upright?\

      \ energy into electrons and voltages, and then the various conversions and computations\
      \ that we must perform to take that base data and convert it into a form suitable\
      \ for actual empirical research investigation. \n\nLet\u2019s not shy away from\
      \ the fact that I skipped an unbelievable number of steps in that part, not\
      \ just in the calculations, but also in the basics of how a camera works. I\
      \ know vaguely how a camera operates on an engineering level, but not specifically,\
      \ let alone how it sends signals down a wire to be absorbed by a USB port, which\
      \ is handled by the USB Foundation\u2014a cabal of probably hundreds to thousands\
      \ of people who have been working on how to read data out of a voltage pin of\
      \ a little rectangular port on a computer for decades. Then it goes into the\
      \ computer, where there are CPUs, RAM, hard drives\u2014the processes involved\
      \ in all of this. This is why no human ever operates alone; we are all standing\
      \ on each other's shoulders, using the lifetimes of labor of others to focus\
      \ on what we\u2019re actually looking at.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s not forget about\

      \ the metallurgy that made the stand or the plastic or glass\u2014it can be\
      \ overwhelming. So, we will boil it down and move on.\n\nYes, great, it\u2019\
      s in these existential crises where the real learning happens. Here I am, a\
      \ fun little skeleton. Let\u2019s see, let\u2019s say in this range: round frame,\
      \ let's display a custom color\u2014great. Okay, look at me go! Here I am, standing.\
      \ This is Skelly; Skelly is the logo for the Freeat Foundation\u2014good job,\

      \ mesh, like an animation thing; it\u2019s not really data, but more for visual\
      \ purposes.\n\nNow, these are the rigid bodies\u2014the simplified chunk segments\
      \ we\u2019re going to designate as parts of my body. This is my center of mass,\
      \ calculated with the anthropometry tables discussed earlier. The red line here\u2014\
      let\u2019s make that pink\u2014represents the vertical projection of that three-dimensional\
      \ point. You see terms like vertical projection; it sounds very mathematical\
      \ and complex, and it kind of is. But also, this is the ground\u2014let\u2019\
      s say the ground is where Z equals zero. You could define anything any way you\
      \ want; let\u2019s just say the ground is at zero height. If I have an x, y,\
      \ z location and let\u2019s say z is 1 or 1.2 in height, to find the vertical\
      \ projection, I just set z to zero. This gives me the same ground xy horizontal\
      \ position, but it\u2019s directly underneath the point of interest.\n\nWhy\
      \ do I want to see that? Because I\u2019m talking about balance. Whenever I\

      \ The base of support is on the ground. I don\u2019t really want to overcomplicate\
      \ this; for this task, the jumping task, height is important, but for the balance\
      \ task, I care very much about the position on the ground plane. I\u2019ll project\
      \ it down onto the ground plane and compare it to my base of support. What is\

      \ base of support on the ground. I can see where my feet are\u2014the region\
      \ of the ground where I can exert pressure and change forces to affect my center\
      \ of mass. I can push it outside of my base of support, but when I do that,\
      \ I have to move my other foot or I will fall. For this task, as I defined it,\
      \ I told myself, as a research participant, that my goal was to lean without\
      \ moving my feet. Thus, if my feet move, I have failed the task at hand, and\
      \ we assume that the neural control I\u2019m exhibiting is in service of completing\
      \ that task. We\u2019ve defined success and failure in this context, which gives\
      \ us a little bit more leverage to interpret this squiggly line in terms of\
      \ how it relates to things like balance and posture. \n\nNow, I will update\
      \ this to 300 z; great. The pink line is now showing the previous ten seconds,\
      \ which is too much data. Let's go ahead and update it to reflect just the necessary\
      \ information. I'm brought a mouse today because it\u2019s hard enough to navigate\

    text: "So, this is also important. I start out outside of the screen; this is\
      \ what we call invalid data. I didn\u2019t do this; you were all here. If I\
      \ had, you would have noticed. But this is what happens when there\u2019s nothing\
      \ in the screen on the CSV file. This data looks just the same as the data where\
      \ it\u2019s actually like a stick figure. It\u2019s just not real. I come in\
      \ and I say, \"Oh yeah!\" Then it snaps on top of me. Let\u2019s see here. Here\
      \ I am, standing and leaning forward. There\u2019s something... oh, let\u2019\
      s do it like that. Oh, there we go! I\u2019m leaning all the way over. It\u2019\
      s a little bit outside, so there\u2019s another layer of this: I\u2019m calculating\
      \ how to orient myself on the ground, which I don\u2019t trust 100%. I don\u2019\
      t fully trust this data, but theoretically, the theory predicts that I should\
      \ be right at the edge of my foot when I\u2019m leaning this way. Although,\
      \ if we look at the data about what\u2019s being tracked on my feet, it\u2019\
      s like, okay, but it\u2019s a very impoverished model of the foot. I have heel,\
      \ I have toe, but I don\u2019t have this outer extent of my foot. So, even though\
      \ I can put force into the ground all the way out to here, the data we have\
      \ shows my foot as just being a thin line on the ground. Furthermore, because\
      \ this software wasn\u2019t really designed to be scientific, those predictions\
      \ vary slightly for each viewpoint of the cameras. So, there\u2019s a whole\
      \ layer upon layer of how much you trust specific data about where the feet\
      \ are versus the full-body data about where the body is. But, you know, it\u2019\
      s kind of close enough. It\u2019s also hard for a lot of reasons. Generally\
      \ speaking, when you\u2019re studying human behavior, the harder the task, the\
      \ easier it is to interpret. The harder the task is, the fewer options are available\
      \ to complete the task. If you assume that I can do the task, then the harder\
      \ it is, the easier it is to interpret. For example, standing on two feet is\
      \ easier than standing on one foot because the base of support is larger. Making\
      \ predictions about where the center of mass will be within that base of support\
      \ is necessarily more difficult. You\u2019re picking from a larger region. When\
      \ I\u2019m on one foot, the base of support is much smaller, and so the ability\
      \ to predict\u2014assuming that I\u2019m successfully standing on one foot\u2014\
      where the center of mass will be in this smaller region is easier because it\u2019\
      s a smaller area. There are fewer things I could be doing that would successfully\
      \ complete the task since the task is harder. If we look here at this moment\
      \ when I\u2019m standing on my right foot and examine the vertical projection\
      \ of the center of mass... let\u2019s see, so here we go: at frame 1137, I picked\
      \ up my foot to 2058. So, for these thousand frames, I am standing over my right\
      \ foot. And what do you know? The vertical projection is right over my right\
      \ foot! Hooray! Science works, physics works, mechanics are true. This isn\u2019\
      t enough to tell me about my hip torques; the center of mass on its own isn\u2019\
      t going to tell me about things like my hip torque or my knee flexion, but in\
      \ terms of the base level task of whether I\u2019m keeping my foot in the right\
      \ location relative to my body to stay upright, sure enough, I am. And you can\
      \ see again, it\u2019s sort of easy to belittle or overlook this, but this is\
      \ a really cool thing, and I\u2019m proud of it. So, you\u2019re welcome. Sorry,\
      \ I said that. Regarding the base standing posture, we could look at the left\
      \ foot, but we\u2019re running out of time very quickly. Let\u2019s assume for\
      \ practical purposes that the left side of my body and the right side are similar\
      \ enough that we don\u2019t have to care about the left side versus the right\
      \ side. That\u2019s not entirely true because of handedness and footedness.\
      \ I think I\u2019m better on my right foot than on my left foot, or vice versa;\
      \ I can\u2019t remember. But for the sake of expedience, this is what it looks\
      \ like when I\u2019m standing under my own power and anatomical base of support.\
      \ Regarding predictions, how might this change if I\u2019m holding something\
      \ additional, like something else outside my body? You can ask what aspects\
      \ of this physical model no longer apply when I touch something outside my body.\
      \ One thing is that my ability to apply force to move my body is constrained\
      \ to where my feet are when I\u2019m standing on the ground. My base of support\
      \ is defined by my feet because that\u2019s where I can apply force. This is\
      \ Newton\u2019s third law: for every action I put into the world, there\u2019\
      s a reaction. In this context, that\u2019s called the ground reaction force,\
      \ which is very useful; you use it every day. I say that because, due to this\
      \ constraint on my ability to apply force being tied to my feet, I must keep\
      \ my center of mass above my base of support. If I\u2019m now touching something\
      \ else, that statement no longer holds true. I can get a reaction force from\
      \ the table, which is not where my foot is. In this data recording, I have no\
      \ record of where the table was. If I\u2019m looking at this data, I can\u2019\
      t make that same prediction about where the center of mass would be. I can only\
      \ predict which direction I\u2019m able to move out of that base of support\
      \ and which direction would result in falling over. In 2015, during the DARPA\
      \ Robotics Challenge, a bunch of bipedal robots were walking around and, while\
      \ they made significant advances for the field, they struggled hilariously.\
      \ One of the biggest issues they had was calculating the reaction forces. They\
      \ had very good sensors on the ground, but they lacked quality sensors elsewhere.\
      \ In one case, a robot was standing in a doorway, trying to figure out what\
      \ to do. It was calculating the forces needed to move in the right direction\
      \ but didn\u2019t realize its arm was touching the door frame. As a result,\
      \ it wasn\u2019t accounting for that additional force. So, when it tried to\
      \ take a step, it fell over, leading to a balance response that was also incorrect\
      \ because it hadn\u2019t accounted for that. If you Google the 2015 DARPA Robotics\
      \ Challenge, you\u2019ll find a lot of clips of bipeds falling over dramatically,\
      \ reminding us of how powerful a motor you need to move something with such\
      \ an incredible mechanical disadvantage. Anyway, three minutes isn\u2019t enough\
      \ time, but we\u2019ll do this quickly. Hopefully, we can get this in. Yeah,\
      \ center of mass\u2014sorry, standing supported. This is now the other recording,\
      \ same basic structure; except now I am holding this stick with my... well,\
      \ let\u2019s see where I\u2019m holding it. I think it\u2019s in my right hand."

      \ I don\u2019t think we need the tails. And so now we should be able to make\
      \ a nice prediction, especially because I was there. We go. So let\u2019s see,\
      \ 1182, 1182 to... Oh, actually, I do want that about 2,000, and I do want to\
      \ put... Okay, round frame, uh, 50, 500 before, zero after. Calculate the whole\
      \ thing and display, no key frames. Color is going to be green. Great, and what\
      \ do you know? Sure enough, it\u2019s on the outside of the foot. So understandably,\
      \ before we said this, it\u2019s like, \"Oh, we don\u2019t really trust the\
      \ locations of the foot to this high of a level of fidelity,\" which is a fair\
      \ point. But we also saw in that control condition that when I\u2019m standing\
      \ on one foot, it\u2019s pretty close to that line between the heel and the\
      \ toe. Now that I have this unmeasured balance support over here, my actual\
      \ base of support is no longer just the foot; it\u2019s the foot plus a little\
      \ balance point over there. And the reality is that, you know, I weigh like\
      \ 200ish pounds, and that\u2019s a lot of force. I can\u2019t really put an\

      \ So it\u2019s not like the point is as good as the foot, but mathematically,\

- full_transcript: okay so uh catching up we are here in week five and slowly catching
    up to reality I suppose um so last week we recorded some motion capture data involving
    standing posture and jumps and repeated jumps and that whole good stuff and then
    um last time on Monday we looked pretty closely into that data um focusing on
    the sort of like the epistemological chain like the from like the the pipeline
    from the empirical measurement represented by the video recordings into the sort
    of like increasingly more complex analyses and sort of you know processes that
    that produce the data into a format that we could actually start to analyze understand
    and sort of make some insights about the thing that we care about which in that
    case was standing posture and looking at the differences between the supported
    versus the unsupported thing and sort of trying to wrap our head around that way
    of looking at data um and I hope that was kind of like generally helpful both
    for like you know this specific type of data but also like that same kind of thought
    process will be true for any kind of scientific investigation you want to do like
    at any at some level if you&amp;#39;re looking if you&amp;#39;re trying to derive
    knowledge about the world on the basis of some kind of empirical measurement it&amp;#39;s
    going to have some kind of a process that&amp;#39;s similar to what we went through
    last time where there&amp;#39;s going to be some tool that is taking some kind
    of a measurement from the world that measurement will be some super basic sort
    of like some energy in the world that gets transformed into some quantity that
    is easy for us to sort of record and take a record of and then generally speaking
    that data will not be something that you can just look at and then sort of derive
    anything interesting about the world there&amp;#39;s going to have to be some
    kind of a process of calibration and computation and Analysis and da da da da
    da and at the end of that sort of sometimes very long computational pipeline you&amp;#39;ll
    be looking at data that will be represented in some way and you&amp;#39;ll be
    trying to generate something resembling knowledge about the world from looking
    at that so I think the main point I wanted to make last time is just to think
    about each stage of that process as a sort of a a chain of epistemological grounding
    um where your ability to trust the outcome of that long pipeline is only as strong
    as the weakest link in that analysis so if there&amp;#39;s some like weird magic
    step in Step 12 of 255 even if every other step in that process is super grounded
    truth preserving like old school reliable computation if there&amp;#39;s some
    weird step in the middle there everything after that is no longer reliable in
    terms of like its ability to track reality in the way that we want it to um so
    today uh I&amp;#39;m going to do sort of two things which is historically a mistake
    but I think we can do it um I I want to sort of look at just go back into the
    data and look at the some of the the data that we didn&amp;#39;t look at which
    is the the last condition of the repeated jumping um and show uh a an analysis
    of that data that have generated in previous years and can look at here um to
    make a couple of different points both just sort of like that U the different
    structure of a movement that has that kind of like repetitive phasic kind of aspect
    to it so as opposed to being standing posture which is a continuous control problem
    or like a big singular jump which is like a discreet sort of behavior um the repeated
    jumping has this kind of phasic thing where sort of each stage I see you uh uh
    each stage sort of sets each step in the phasic process sets you up for the next
    iteration um and so there&amp;#39;s just some different ways of analyzing data
    like that and there&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;s many many many aspects of the natural
    world that has that sort of property Locomotion running is one of them also like
    your circadian rhythms and you know like the seasons uh a lot of things have this
    structure of kind of like a pattern that repeats itself um in a way that&amp;#39;s
    sort of like related to linear time but not directly related so like the seasons
    is a good example of that actually like the the the year counts up so 24 25 26
    um but when comes at its own sort of rate and we&amp;#39;ll just look a little
    bit about that um hopefully that won&amp;#39;t take us all that long um and I
    want to leave the last sort of optimistically hour but possibly less uh to do
    a little bit of small group work um which I will sort of try to relate to the
    initial part um where it that will be forming into small groups of roughly uh
    three three three-ish folks um with the intention of sort of doing some work with
    the bot to find a a paper which can complement the paper that you&amp;#39;ve already
    chosen for your chosen topic and specifically trying to find papers on a similar
    topic but are that are sort of distinct in some interesting way so you can start
    looking at sort of different perspectives on your chosen topic um yeah and then
    I think that will sort of lead us nicely into kind of like the second half of
    the semester and by the end of next week I want to kind of be getting into the
    space where you have like a more grounded sense of what the the final poster project
    is really going to look like and sort of you know have the ability to start hypothetically
    making movements in that direction realize that there&amp;#39;s kind of some weird
    timing here but don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t stress too much about those things
    we&amp;#39;ll make it we&amp;#39;ll make it work um right yeah anyways just realized
    that yeah poster do is less of it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s less of an exclamation
    point than it appears on the page um this upload poster this is really the hard
    deadline like you have to upload your poster so they can get printed in time for
    whatever um everything before that is a little more squishy I try to make this
    do before spring bake so that you&amp;#39;re kind of like free from that responsibility
    but there&amp;#39;s a little bit of like weird squishiness there um okay cool
    everyone cool with that so far any assignment anxiety yeah good um all right and
    there will be a sort of we&amp;#39;re going to call it an exam for bureaucratic
    reasons but it&amp;#39;s really just going to be another one of these like directed
    bot-based conversations where specifically I&amp;#39;m going to be extracting
    all the like the the sort of philosophy of science kinds of aspects of the past
    several lectures in terms of like units and recordings and empirical this and
    that and you will have a directed conversation with the AI about connecting those
    types of thoughts to the particular domain that you&amp;#39;ve chosen to study
    um I can&amp;#39;t imagine any of you have chosen a topic that won&amp;#39;t have
    some relationship with units and measurement and methodology and stuff like that
    so um you know it&amp;#39;s not going to be something that you can it we&amp;#39;re
    going to call it an exam but you can&amp;#39;t really get a grade on it because
    I think it&amp;#39;s unethical to use AI to grade things um for a lot of reasons
    but we will yeah we&amp;#39;ll be fine okay so um I have to start up Discord which
    could take a second um I did move the recordings from the other week into a Google
    drive folder so you can download them if you so choose uh I&amp;#39;m not going
    to really going too deep into that aspect of it um but in the server in the links
    and resources there&amp;#39;s a Google Drive link that will take you to a page
    which should show something if this loads am I on the internet yeah so these are
    all the recordings in some strange order uh yeah maybe a different maybe later
    in the semester I&amp;#39;ll talk a little more about how to get it and run it
    but um for now you can kind of my the the only recommendation I&amp;#39;ll make
    is if you want to look at any of these on your computer your best bet is to download
    the entire folder so don&amp;#39;t download bits and pieces download the the entire
    folder of a given recording and then open up the blend file with blender and poke
    around and if you don&amp;#39;t know how to use blender there are many many many
    many many tutorials online on how to do that so you can figure that out on your
    own okay so with that said you thinking so hard buddy let&amp;#39;s take a look
    at this repeated jumps recording so if you recall let see here so again this is
    going to come up later but again noticing that the the initial data here is broken
    garbage because I am not in the scene everything gets this is a very common way
    that data breaks when you&amp;#39;re trying to do 3D stuff with bad input it just
    all gets squished into a singular line um so this will come up later just notice
    that the data starts out as garbage and then it sort of snaps into place whenever
    I walk into the scene and I stand here in that sort of calibration sort of pose
    and I then start bouncing up and down hide and if we hide this we can look at
    that and we can grab I think we can [Music] do that [Music] work I never know
    how to make that work it&amp;#39;s fine okay so we gra you we&amp;#39;re going
    to say round frame we&amp;#39;re going to do two seconds before and not after
    and then we going to calculate whole recording then we&amp;#39;re going to hide
    the key frames show custom color make it make it Pink and yeah and so there we
    go so here I am jumping for some amount of time and I guess let&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;ll
    get to that when we get to that and let&amp;#39;s look at the graph editor let&amp;#39;s
    turn so with the standing posture stuff uh I was look we were looking at like
    the projection of the center of mass onto the floor relative to the base of support
    and so in that for that task the height of the center of mass is not relevant
    to that analysis we only really care about where I am where that where that Center
    of mass position is on the ground plane which we&amp;#39;re going to Define as
    XY and then Z is going to be up in this world um so that balance task X and Y
    are relevant Dimensions Z is not a relevant dimension for the model of of standing
    that we&amp;#39;re looking at there if we were looking at a more comp complex
    model of standing that had things like joint angles and stuff like that we might
    care about the Z axis but because we&amp;#39;re living in this sort of hypers
    simplified world we basically get to throw away the height of the center mass
    and now we&amp;#39;ve boiled down this entire complex being data object into two
    singular points um with something like jumping it&amp;#39;s the opposite uh when
    I&amp;#39;m jumping around we&amp;#39;re thinking about that as something like
    I&amp;#39;m putting Force into the ground that is fighting against gravity and
    if I put more Force into the ground than I weigh uh where weight is measured in
    Newton so it&amp;#39;s Mass my body mass times gravity gives you my Newton Force
    if I put more than that Force into the ground I will temporarily leave the ground
    as gravity sucks that energy away from me I will reach a certain height and then
    come back to the ground so that behavior is defined relative to this inertial
    reference plane and specifically inertial reference frame is like basically like
    code work for the ground is at zero and you know some direction points up and
    so that jumping Behavior it if I&amp;#39;m jumping here or jumping there or jumping
    there or jumping there it&amp;#39;s the same process either way so in this for
    this behavior for this task we actually don&amp;#39;t care about the X and Y AIS
    and we only care about the z-axis the vertical axis um if this was a different
    task I&amp;#39;m like going from Stepping Stones if I&amp;#39;m jumping if the
    task said jump in place and don&amp;#39;t shift around then the ground plane becomes
    important but if we&amp;#39;re just thinking about the base level physics of it
    the physics are the same in one part of the room or the other all of which is
    basically a long-winded way of saying that I can turn off the X and Y data from
    this viewer and normalize that it&amp;#39;s not actually what I wanted and what
    is going on there not sure why that looks like that but okay and we get this nice
    so this data here so this shows the sort of vertical motion of my center of mass
    so the x axis here hypothetically is meters um so from except it&amp;#39;s upside
    down why is it upside down I don&amp;#39;t know why it&amp;#39;s upside down um
    these units are confusing me a little bit I think it kind of loses track of some
    of that because it&amp;#39;s this is negative .85 and this is negative point9
    so that&amp;#39;s kind of down but this is yeah that that says this one says 1.43
    M which is probably about this high this is one 1.8 so let&amp;#39;s call this
    1.4 um I I could probably jump that seems right um so I don&amp;#39;t know why
    these units are happening this is sort of a thing that I&amp;#39;ve noted like
    blender is not a scientific tool blender is an animation artistic tool so sometimes
    things like oh let&amp;#39;s make sure all the the units are correct they&amp;#39;re
    a little more fudgy on that than you would expect from a scientific tool but this
    is sort of a it&amp;#39;s more of a cultural thing than any real like in order
    to do this type of stuff right they have to be doing the math correctly and they
    have to be keeping track of units here and there or the other but the user base
    of this software are more concerned with just like the general shapes of the data
    and sort of and things were like oh these numbers don&amp;#39;t actually match
    those numbers is first of all almost certainly like a setting that I&amp;#39;m
    not doing properly but you know a scientific tool wouldn&amp;#39;t do this an
    artistic tool would luckily in this context I similarly don&amp;#39;t really care
    about the values I only care about the shapes um but this is sort of a nice opportunity
    to look at how this non-dimensionalization so so dropping the X and Y AIS the
    X and Y data from this plot makes it so that the data becomes this much simpler
    one-dimensional time series right because the x-axis represents time specifically
    it represents frame number uh where if you wanted to calculate like the clock
    time we could convert that using our knowledge of the frame rate and that stuff
    like that um but if you&amp;#39;ll notice as I&amp;#39;m sort of so down here
    at the bottom of the jump I jump up uh in the actual 3D data I&amp;#39;m kind
    of Shifting around in space like I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m not bouncing on over
    the origin the whole time I&amp;#39;m shifting around my X and Y values are changing
    um but we don&amp;#39;t have to care about that if we&amp;#39;re just looking
    at the height so in terms of the mechanics of the situation we could convert this
    into Newtons by just multiplying by getting the potential energy here and just
    saying okay the the Z height is height and then Mass doesn&amp;#39;t change gravity
    doesn&amp;#39;t change so this if we wanted to convert this plot into a plot of
    the potential energy of the physical system we could do that by just basically
    scaling it by by my mass or and the gravity on Earth um at which point you know
    again and if we did that these numbers would change but the shape would not because
    there&amp;#39;s nothing interesting happening there so there&amp;#39;s a lot of
    things that we could look at here if we had you know more time in research funding
    and stuff like that um one of which would be like let&amp;#39;s assume you know
    if we were like sports biomechanists and we wanted to know about the force production
    that leads into jumping you know we might want to look at you know how this sort
    of phase on the ground can I zoom there more oop so here I am up at the top of
    the jump um and then as I come down like so looking at the video back there you
    can tell right around there so I&amp;#39;m off the ground and then this is around
    this frame is where I hit the ground no wait no that&amp;#39;s not right that&amp;#39;s
    the opposite okay right around there so this whole phase here where I&amp;#39;m
    on the ground this first part you can see I&amp;#39;m kind of I&amp;#39;m compressing
    like I have a lot of energy in like mechanical energy in the system that has to
    go somewhere um and so I I bend my legs I&amp;#39;m not I don&amp;#39;t have like
    EMG recording the muscles on my quadriceps and hamstrings or whatever but they&amp;#39;re
    on I promise you that they&amp;#39;re on because I don&amp;#39;t collapse to the
    ground my legs just kind of deform a little bit and then I push off and I come
    back into I go back into the air so this is where I think we&amp;#39;ve come across
    the term like neuromechanics before this is kind of at that level we we could
    ask questions at that level here about like you know how efficient am I as an
    organism at taking advantage of the fact that the force of gravity is preloading
    my muscles with all this like nice spring Force then how how efficiently do I
    utilize that spring force in order to launch myself off the ground for the next
    jump because clearly when I push off I am using um you know something from on
    high is sending the signal down to trigger a muscle firing that will allow me
    to bounce off the ground but unlike that standing high jump thing I don&amp;#39;t
    have to generate all that force on my own I have some of the force from the previous
    jump preloading my limbs so that when I actually you know take off in the next
    jump I have the the force from my muscles is going to be presumably sort of like
    efficiently combined with the spring force from the previous jump which is also
    you know it gets very complicated very quickly um so yeah like so we could look
    at sort of you know how efficiently I&amp;#39;m doing that translation from from
    one jump to the other um we could also look at things like fatigue so if we were
    looking if we expected that over the course like these jumps look pretty similar
    but it might be the case that if you looked at the the time between the Peaks
    it might get longer as I get more tired the the peak height might get a little
    bit less as I get tired I wasn&amp;#39;t really pushing myself all that hard so
    and it wasn&amp;#39;t a particularly long recording um so if those numbers are
    there they might be more subtle um but there&amp;#39;s a lot of sort of potential
    analyses and potential kind of um just ways of considering this data uh that would
    not be sort of possible just it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s only possible because of
    the sort of repetitive aspect of it and again like I&amp;#39;ve said before the
    stuff for bouncing in place is kind of like a proxy for what it would look like
    if this was like if I was running or or jogging or walking or something one of
    those kind of repeated sort of behaviors there um and again just kind of like
    highlighting while this data in the middle looks nice just looking at what bad
    data looks like sort of because one of the real advantages of this type of data
    is it is directly coupled and tied to like a thing that we have very very strong
    intuitions about because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s human movement it&amp;#39;s
    video like we kind of have some sense of what that data looks like if this was
    me a measurement off of an accelerometer if it was a measurement off of an you
    know Mass spectrometer or something that is less tied to our kind of like you
    know the part of the world that we tend to operate and have a lot of intuitions
    about might not be as obvious when the data is like good and viable versus when
    it&amp;#39;s being sort of busted out because the because of some methodological
    thing so uh so you know just this is just your reminder when you&amp;#39;re thinking
    about data that you always have to be asking the question when you&amp;#39;re
    when you&amp;#39;re looking at a data source from a from a piece of equipment
    or wherever you get it from you always kind of be have to be asking the question
    am I looking at signal or am I looking at noise signal to noise ratio is kind
    of like a whole whole other conversation um but this is where kind of like building
    intuitions building understanding and just really like like having that kind of
    gut check of like am I looking at something that&amp;#39;s worth analysis or am
    I looking at some sort of noise and bug in the system um and that yeah that figuring
    that out can be often the challenging part also noticing because this will also
    come up later this moment here where at some point on my way out there&amp;#39;s
    like a a spike which can also happen where like for one frame everything just
    jumped over here so there is one data point that is way outside the actual expected
    range um which will come up in a bit okay that&amp;#39;ll make rough sense following
    along jumping in space get that no one&amp;#39;s mind is blown yet okay um okay
    so let&amp;#39;s now now let&amp;#39;s look at ways of representing this data
    that can sort of help us understand and sort of starting to like torture the data
    into a shape that&amp;#39;s more amenable to that kind of like phase based um
    analysis and for that I&amp;#39;m also going to show you just a little bit of
    code um this code is on the the course repository now um if you&amp;#39;re familiar
    with python code and particularly Jupiter notebooks it&amp;#39;s in there um it&amp;#39;s
    not particularly like well set up for sort of student consumption but it&amp;#39;s
    available it&amp;#39;s on there if you want to find it it&amp;#39;s in the repo
    in the Cod fold code folder in the python code folder we&amp;#39;re looking at
    jumping Center of mass and this should run um yeah so I&amp;#39;m not going to
    go too much into the the Cod code parts of it um I will just first of all will
    this run no thank you um just kind of just like doing a a quick pass through just
    interested parties can pay attention uninterested parties can just like wait for
    the Squigly line some pretty pictures um but you&amp;#39;ll hear me talk a lot
    about just like writing code and doing analysis and doing this and that and just
    FYI this is what that looks like um so the first thing you do is you you in you
    install a bunch so this is python code and so the first thing you do is you install
    a bunch of packages and packages like P are for numerical computations scipi for
    things like scientific analysis of this that and the other and then plotly is
    for making the visual plots and squiggly lines and stuff like that um these are
    all packages that were made by people many many people many of these packages
    numpy and S cpai to some extent but numpy in particular has a lineage that goes
    all the way back to the sort of the first history of computing there is always
    at every point in the history of our actually the history of our sort of like
    you know long scale civilization but specifically in the computational world there
    has always been kind of like the de facto best like numerical computation package
    and I think these days numpy is probably the most widely used at least um in the
    sort of data analysis World um but this is the one that does like vector or sort
    of like Matrix computation does linear algebra a lot of like the big number crunching
    of the world is done sort of in numpy or related types of packages I just want
    to point these out because this is very easy to skip over it&amp;#39;s not relevant
    particularly to this course but this is one of those places that if you really
    sit and think about just the the volume of human effort and human labor that went
    into this import numpy line of code is really staggering like like many thousands
    of people over decades working very very hard over a very long amount of time
    to make these things happen and invisibly and for free you can just import all
    of that labor and now all the stuff that we get to do is built off of that work
    that was done by these many folks over the history of their own time anyway um
    this is also a very important stage of every data analysis pipelines life this
    is loading the data in um and this is literally just the path to the folder on
    the computer and then specifically the path to the the body 3D data and then the
    center of mass XYZ data those these are not actually the center the csb uh sort
    of data uh files that I showed last time but they are equivalent um so this is
    the part where that data gets into the program it&amp;#39;s then the RAM and the
    memory of the of the system and so when we when we want to look at it this is
    the part that where the computer has loaded that data in so that those those like
    big infinite sort of piles of numbers that I was showing last time this is the
    part where those numbers now enter into the system&amp;#39;s memory and now we
    can sort of look at them uh load that up yeah you can load and look at its shape
    where this shape is we&amp;#39;re looking at the center of mass so it&amp;#39;s
    1370 by3 so it&amp;#39;s 1,370 frames at 30 frames per second three columns so
    X Y and Z that&amp;#39;s and we talk about the shape of the data that&amp;#39;s
    kind of what we&amp;#39;re talking about like how many frames how many dimensions
    if it had rotation so this would have to be six so XYZ position XYZ rotation so
    this would be 1370 by 6 um and what everything is here blah blah blah yeah get
    different data points there different data points there uh and now this is the
    part I think I I think I&amp;#39;m have to restart it when I run this I think
    it&amp;#39;s basic enough that it happens um this is now the data has shown up
    into the system and this is a very basic Bas plot of that um so this is the raw
    data in like I think it&amp;#39;s plotly or something like that um this is the
    very same data that you see in blender except in a much more impoverished form
    like one of the main kind of like you know labors and wins of the Primo cap software
    was figuring out how to adapt the sort of the lowlevel scientific code so it can
    be shoved into this animation software so that you can do all this nice things
    and like have all this very easy way of clicking around and showing stuff without
    having to write the actual code but again because this is an artist tool it&amp;#39;s
    not really set up for doing kind of like deeper layers of analysis um so this
    is I think it just oh does it just play through yeah so this is sort of this is
    what most this like for a lot of scientific analysis this would already be pretty
    good because it&amp;#39;s an animation in 3D but you can very easily see how this
    is sort of not as useful of an interrogatory tool as something like a professional
    animation software designed for like 3D animations had a very interesting sort
    of layer of our society because they are artists and they think like artists but
    it&amp;#39;s also super heavy technical like computational 3D math um so that
    kind of like that boundary layer that is represented by something like blender
    blender particular being like a free open source software as has that layer of
    it as well um it&amp;#39;s kind of like I think one of the interesting interfaces
    here um this is also a useful way to sort of confirm to yourself that you&amp;#39;ve
    loaded the data correctly that up is in fact this direction very very very common
    very very easy to load the data in a it&amp;#39;s just a snowstorm the dots are
    flying around all over the place or B this person&amp;#39;s jumping like this
    to the side because you haven&amp;#39;t rotated things or you haven&amp;#39;t
    rotated them properly so that Z is up because remember a lot of things we&amp;#39;re
    talking about here assumes that there is a that one of these X y&amp;#39;s and
    Z&amp;#39;s is aligned with the gravity Vector but there&amp;#39;s nothing in
    the Raw geometry that has such a thing as gravity cameras don&amp;#39;t know what
    gravity is unless you have a secondary sensor in them which we don&amp;#39;t um
    so this type of thing sort of gets into uh overlap between like on the one hand
    this is not a like this kind of visualization is not a necessary step of the analysis
    pipeline but on a very practical level it absolutely is a necessary step to have
    what we would call observability in your pipeline where the observability is the
    part where you can just you know you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re
    crunching big numbers with with fancy code and the observability is a part where
    it produces something that you can use your your human eyeballs and big human
    brain to just look at it and say oh yeah that looks right that looks like a person
    jumping they look like they&amp;#39;re oriented with gravity and now because of
    that I am now confident to move on to the next stages of the of the pipeline and
    start analyzing data whoever wrote this this is a can&amp;#39;t remember who wrote
    this originally but I always get I always like notice stuff like this like this
    is the British spelling of analyzing with a s instead of a z so I don&amp;#39;t
    know could have been me could have been someone else hard to say okay so um so
    we&amp;#39;ve talked about time series uh this this is not a Time series this
    is a spatial representation of the data there is actually nothing in this data
    that tells you what time is if you it just happens to overtime plot the data from
    the next frame at roughly 30 frames per second so it you can see time in the movement
    of in in the by looking at it for but there&amp;#39;s nothing in this repres this
    is a spatial representation there&amp;#39;s nothing in there sort none of these
    axes are are T they are x y and z um so we can also we can take that and then
    we can also represent it in this time series format right so this now we have
    to split it up so it can be flat we have X Y and Z and then this axis is time
    again specifically it&amp;#39;s frame number so we&amp;#39;re not in SI units
    here we&amp;#39;re in we don&amp;#39;t this for this to be SI units this would
    have to be seconds but this is frames um so if you want to convert this to frames
    multiply this number by 0.033 or something which is the number of seconds per
    frame right frames per second and then you can do some sort of nonsense and you
    get seconds per frame and this is one of the weird things about this part of calculus
    I don&amp;#39;t know um is realizing that you can do the same kind of like fraction
    math for units that you would for numbers and it&amp;#39;s like valid to do that
    so frames per second is you can do that math and get 33 Mill seconds per frame
    from 30 FPS um yeah right yes so before when I was showing this I had already
    truncated the end frame to be before the actual end of the of the recording remember
    when I said to notice this one weird spiky dot at the end of the recording if
    I don&amp;#39;t account for that and I just plot all of the data at some point
    something on this computer is going to crash um this is what it looks like because
    it&amp;#39;s I just said plot X plot y plot Z relative to the frame number um
    and it says sure no problem let I&amp;#39;ll do that for you and because I&amp;#39;m
    such a friendly computer I&amp;#39;ll be smart about how to do the axes specifically
    how to do this y AIS so that you can see all the data that you asked me to plot
    um but there&amp;#39;s this huge spiky outlier here that sort of ruins that so
    this spiky outlier so this this plot goes from zero to 15,000 um which I don&amp;#39;t
    know if you remember from last time I did not actually fly 15,000 meters into
    the sky and then back that actually didn&amp;#39;t happen oh sorry millimeters
    so 15,000 millimeters into the sky the this is a Blobby data Spike so I could
    fix this by sort of using my intuition and saying oh let me let me tell the code
    to only have the Y limit show this range of numbers but I don&amp;#39;t know what
    that range should be so the other thing I can do is I can go up here and I can
    say okay the start frame is zero the end frame negative one means just like the
    last frame um but I can also this is again where the observability comes super
    helpful uh I can just go into this code and say okay let&amp;#39;s see so this
    first chunk is sloppy data of nothing until let&amp;#39;s say frame 118 let&amp;#39;s
    say yeah let&amp;#39;s say 150 is when the good the good data starts and it stays
    pretty good until let&amp;#39;s say uh 12 let&amp;#39;s say 1213 so let&amp;#39;s
    say 150 to 1213 so start frame 150 uh end frame 123 and and then I appli it again
    instead of looking like that weird spike it looks like this so often times we
    need do data collection you&amp;#39;re you you&amp;#39;re trying to like if you&amp;#39;re
    doing data collection you&amp;#39;re typically going be doing the same thing over
    and over again like multiple participants multiple you know conditions multiple
    days da da da so you really want your pipelines to have as little as possible
    of you the human have to go in and look at something and sort of figure out like
    what I just did of like oh let&amp;#39;s you frame blah blah blah to frame blah
    blah blah that&amp;#39;s a manual labor step that requires me to like do stuff
    with my human brain I can&amp;#39;t just load the data click go come back tomorrow
    record new data change the path and then click go I have to look at it and sort
    of pull out a number then write that down somewhere so you want to minimize those
    steps but practically speaking there&amp;#39;s almost always going to be some
    amount of that kind of like data cleaning data preparation and so if this was
    going to be part of a longer study I would have some place to write down for data
    collection day whatever for participant whatever for condition whatever the start
    frame is 150 the end frame is 1213 and I would have some place to record those
    numbers so that as I keep collecting data I will keep I&amp;#39;ll be able to
    keep track of this when I do the main analysis I can know that I&amp;#39;m only
    getting the good good stuff yeah so it would be it would be really hard to pick
    a frame number um you could do something more kind of like what we did where like
    I picked kind of like a duration of time of like I want to do you know 30 seconds
    and then that would correspond to you know 30 seconds times 30 frames per second
    it&amp;#39;s like 900 frames or something like that but I wouldn&amp;#39;t be
    able to necessarily say like oh on on frame 150 to frame 932 you know that&amp;#39;s
    something that you couldn&amp;#39;t really do you something that&amp;#39;s much
    more common to do is first of all picking durations and secondly deciding a behavior
    that will make the data easy to chop out often times in an analytical way so with
    this if I said okay stand here don&amp;#39;t move for five seconds jump jump jump
    jump jump and at the end stand here don&amp;#39;t move for five seconds then in
    the data when we look back at it there would be these flat spots right here to
    right here I like didn&amp;#39;t wait too long at the end um but this is the kind
    of thing that would be pretty easy to write some bit of code where you looking
    at the velocity of the blah blah blah and then just find something that sort of
    automatically goes through and chunks out the first step from the last step and
    I would you know at this point in my life I could write that code pretty easily
    and trust it pretty easily um but that was kind for like a hard-earned ability
    to do that and also anytime you&amp;#39;re doing that like you&amp;#39;re always
    if you record enough data then that automated pipeline is going to work like 90%
    of the time and then that 10th time it&amp;#39;s going to find something weird
    in the middle and then chop one of your participants data in half and then you&amp;#39;re
    not going to notice that until way too late blah blah blah blah blah so there
    always there&amp;#39;s always a very complex dance between I&amp;#39;m trying
    to automate every part of this pipeline so I can operate really efficiently versus
    the most efficient thing I can do is just manually Define these data points for
    each for each participant and then write it down somewhere and then like have
    just like another like CSV that just says for a participant one you know condition
    block two whatever start frame this and frame that and then at the end of each
    recording session I just write down those numbers and I never have to think about
    it again I don&amp;#39;t have to write any fancy code to do it um sort of there&amp;#39;s
    that&amp;#39;s one of those like no answers thing and then if you go to grad school
    you will uh you will lose significant hours of your life on that sort of like
    should I automate this or do it manually stage um it&amp;#39;s a very classic
    brain trap that it has no true escape um yeah yeah that&amp;#39;s a yeah good
    question as there are they all okay okay so okay yeah so this part is now so again
    looking at this as a behavior looking at the X the Y and the Z we can see again
    that like you know the task is is very well defined in that z-axis um and you
    can see this nice sort of regularity of the data there and of like you know you
    in your brain it&amp;#39;s like oh yeah there this is some there&amp;#39;s something
    I there&amp;#39;s something I can pull out of this like there&amp;#39;s enough
    regularity here that it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s something that I can pull out
    scientifically like this this is tractable this type of data there&amp;#39;s just
    there more noisy so there&amp;#39;s nothing obvious jumping out like this one
    oh there&amp;#39;s a structure here it&amp;#39;s a repeating structure it&amp;#39;s
    like a cyclical thing there&amp;#39;s some kind of s cosine nonsense going on
    I could probably do it&amp;#39;s oriented relative to gravity so there&amp;#39;s
    just all these kind of like knobs that I can that you can like sink your scientific
    teeth into to try to figure out what&amp;#39;s going on here whereas these the
    structure is not quite as obvious you can still see something of the the jumping
    just in that shape but that might actually be an error elsewhere in the pipeline
    um but you can see I&amp;#39;m kind of like shifting around um there&amp;#39;s
    nothing super obvious there and there&amp;#39;s nothing in the task that really
    makes these Dimensions important again if you had given me the task of I&amp;#39;m
    going to put like a penny on the ground and you have to jump up and down only
    on that Penny then now the deviations from that point in the X and Y become a
    part of the behavior and maybe you could look at sort of you know how I&amp;#39;m
    Meandering relative to this and that but in this particular analyses we are going
    to ignore X and Y and then focus on Z which is vertical height um yeah so this
    term here kinetics uh this is one of those many kind of like Latin root terms
    a lot of science is really built on this like let&amp;#39;s find two Latin words
    that sound very similar and then build an entire field on separating them apart
    um in this in human movement it&amp;#39;s kinematics versus kinetics so kinematics
    is kind of like this stuff it&amp;#39;s kind of the kinematics is like related
    to movement so things like joint angles and position and sort of like body posture
    um the kind of like the geometry aspects of things is wrapped up in kinematics
    kinetics is related to forces um so that&amp;#39;s where you start thinking things
    like force placeat and stuff like that um joint torqus and stuff like that and
    in this case because we&amp;#39;re looking at the Z Direction in the vertical
    which aligns with the sort of kinetic or kinetic potential energy sort of trade-off
    this kind of when we continue to look at that vertical Dimension that counts as
    a kinetic analysis because the units are Newtons um yeah so then we clean it up
    this is a butter filter uh don&amp;#39;t stress about that um it just is a smoother
    and a cleaner and a ask the bot about Butterworth filters um if you&amp;#39;re
    into it one of those like yeah not not this is not the class for that um oh yeah
    look this is I think I can&amp;#39;t remember exactly who wrote this code it wasn&amp;#39;t
    me it was my former lab manager Michael but you can see here time equals 1 over
    30 something is now going to come through and convert those frame numbers into
    seconds because later on we&amp;#39;re going to likeit like down here um we&amp;#39;re
    going to be calculating from those Z positions we&amp;#39;re going to be calculating
    Z velocity and Z acceleration and so particularly once you get to things like
    acceleration you kind of want the units to be second because meters per frame
    is a measure of velocity but it&amp;#39;s not a particularly useful one um well
    it&amp;#39;s useful and that it gives you scale but this is also a hardcoded number
    so you&amp;#39;re just writing the number 30 um this is anytime you you&amp;#39;re
    in code if you see someone writing a specific number like three Z you want to
    be careful about that like I would prefer to pull the frame rate from the data
    store somewhere so that way if sometime later I start using 60 frames per second
    cameras or 120 frames per second cameras I have to go searching for all the places
    that I wrote the number 30 I want to just be able to pull that out of the data
    um but in this case we&amp;#39;re just kind of playing around so we&amp;#39;re
    fine um what are we doing here normalizing stuff and doing stuff where we get
    velocity oh yeah oh yeah and this we&amp;#39;re getting velocity and acceleration
    by taking the diff the this this is your Calculus real quick um so X whatever
    so if this is the time and this is z height dot dot dot dot this is the position
    in height in space of off the ground you can diff and p. diff is a very very stupid
    um like it&amp;#39;s a dumb dumb calculation that basically just takes the difference
    so it literally just says okay for frame this one subtract this one from that
    one subtract this one from that one subtract this one from that one and then instead
    of having the Z position on each frame you have the difference between each data
    point and the one that came before it so you have the change in Z position over
    the duration of time defined by one frame and so that is now Delta if we&amp;#39;re
    doing meters Delta meters over some measure of time that&amp;#39;s velocity and
    that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s calculus for you um and if you do that same np.
    diff to the velocity now you&amp;#39;re getting change in velocity over a frame
    duration of time that&amp;#39;s acceleration again this is np. diff is the uh
    numerical derivative I guess like for discrete time intervals that&amp;#39;s the
    same thing when you do calculus you do like the limits and the the smooth this
    guy um but in computational numerical land we just do that and call it good um
    and then the integral is the same way you is sort of the opposite thing that anyways
    um so yeah so then if you plot it again oh we still don&amp;#39;t have those numbers
    I I need to propagate this thing okay that&amp;#39;s the plot that&amp;#39;s [Music]
    that um so I want that to be start oh wait 150 in frame equals was it 1200 is
    or whatever and then total body Center of mass will be start frame to end frame
    and then all everything if I do that and that would be a smaller number yes that&amp;#39;s
    another really common thing to do accidentally which is uh I I had changed that
    start and end frame stuff um for the visualization but I hadn&amp;#39;t actually
    clipped out the actual data so when it got to the next part where it was calculating
    the velocities it was including all those wacky veloc those wacky sort of garbage
    frames and if you think about velocity is the change in position over the the
    the unit in time the that one frame where I jumped off to 15,000 mm in back the
    velocity on that frame is through the roof in the same way because the jump in
    position is also crazy literally through the roof I suppose um so now if we do
    this again uh that there you go so now it&amp;#39;s more cleaned up um can I look
    at this and so let&amp;#39;s see so let&amp;#39;s look at this area right around
    400 so this is the Z position so this is that sort of the the height position
    going on there um this H this is what the velocity of that looks like so roughly
    aligned there and this is what the Z the acceleration looks like so and then this
    is what they look like over overlaid so um this is one of those PL places where
    I think I we&amp;#39;re going to get a chance to do this later but like if this
    was a perfect measurement um then there should be frames like the frames where
    I&amp;#39;m off the ground the acceleration should be negative 10 m/s down um
    I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that this actually I can tell you that so so 398 is a
    peak 398 is down here yeah so this this sort of the low the low part here is the
    part where I&amp;#39;m in ballistic flight and the fact that there&amp;#39;s a
    little hump there tells you that the data is sort of incorrect in some way either
    my center of mass is not being calculated perfectly or in this case I think that
    the the the world is tilted a little bit like the ground plane is not actually
    flat here it&amp;#39;s slightly tilted which I think is also the reason why you&amp;#39;re
    getting the sort of like the jump squiggles are sort of still present in the X
    and Y because you think about jumping on a a slanted ground plane then even though
    you&amp;#39;re booving up and down in space you&amp;#39;re going to sort of see
    some of that in the x and y axis and I know that because I wrote this code and
    I know that that is the sort of that part of the code has some slop to it um but
    but yeah so this is so we can now sort of Chunk this out um and start looking
    at like using this data can start to like get particular layers of I don&amp;#39;t
    know why I always like anytime I have a plan that involves the word and I should
    just scrap it and have two things like it&amp;#39;s already four o&amp;#39; like
    we&amp;#39;re not have time for the other thing but like are we going to do this
    and that it&amp;#39;s like I I&amp;#39;m starting to recognize it but I don&amp;#39;t
    use it to change my behavior so we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll figure that out um
    but yeah so using this so for example one of the things you might want to know
    when you&amp;#39;re jumping very very simple dumb analysis is how many times did
    I jump right if you&amp;#39;re just saying say the task was jump as many times
    as you can in 30 seconds or jump as many times you can until you want to stop
    or something like that just being able to count these jumps would be something
    really helpful um you could just go through an eyeball it you just cramp them
    by hand but that&amp;#39;s first of all not going to be very reliable and secondly
    won&amp;#39;t scale like if you&amp;#39;re doing a bigger analysis you want to
    be able to automate that um and yeah various ways of doing that and in this particular
    case uh I&amp;#39;m pretty sure now this was Michael writing this code um he he&amp;#39;s
    he&amp;#39;s identifying uh peaks in that jump as zero Crossings in the velocity
    um in particular looking at this stage so uh because if you think about the velocity
    of a curve like this can I zoom in on that um up down so I&amp;#39;m accelerating
    upwards so it&amp;#39;s positive velocity and then I hit the Apex and then I&amp;#39;m
    going downward so it&amp;#39;s negative velocity so there&amp;#39;s a zero Crossing
    there um between positive velocity and negative velocity that corresponds to the
    peak of that jump and that&amp;#39;s nice to have um because if you&amp;#39;re
    trying to identify the peak of this jump you can actually actually looking at
    this data you can actually do that pretty easily um um but there&amp;#39;s always
    going to be a point like for this data point here like this one&amp;#39;s pretty
    obvious this is probably the one you want to Peak but pick but if you&amp;#39;re
    trying to pick just the highest one like there can be these kind of ambiguous
    moments because you&amp;#39;re looking for like a like a it needs to be a particular
    number so that&amp;#39;s where PL things like converting into something like velocity
    allows you to look for something like a zero Crossing where the data goes from
    positive number to a negative number and then that becomes a very easy thing to
    to pick out of the data um and representing this is also a I think if I re calculate
    this yeah um here&amp;#39;s another quick tip for data visualizations this this
    is a bad representation of data it&amp;#39;s fine and this is him showing okay
    we using that velocity analysis you can find the peaks of each jump then you can
    just count the number of those and know how many times you jumped but this yellow
    on white no one not doing anyone any favors so we are going to go in here this
    is highle program you see where it says yellow I&amp;#39;m going change that to
    a different color say magenta magenta magent magenta there we go or let&amp;#39;s
    say red sure um yeah and so now we have the number of steps here just going to
    say this out loud when you&amp;#39;re doing data if you have healthy color vision
    you will very quickly go to red and green as the colors to se to show two different
    groups you&amp;#39;re not allowed to use red and green 10% of the population is
    color blind so if you if this if these were green lines with red dots then I my
    10% of my audience cannot see that color distinction so think just look for any
    other so red red blue is good you know blue yellow well not that yellow blue orange
    anyways uh think about color blind people um this is also a good example of despite
    the fact that we had that pretty nice algorithm for finding the peaks of those
    jumps it finds a bunch of jumps right here because it found because the algorithm&amp;#39;s
    kind of dumb it&amp;#39;s just looking for zero Crossings and so when I am just
    standing here you know I&amp;#39;m moving a little bit and it&amp;#39;s finding
    those points and so if we&amp;#39;re naive in the way that we do this we&amp;#39;re
    going to count five extra jumps at the beginning that didn&amp;#39;t actually
    occur and then if we wanted to look at an analysis of like okay you know is there
    is there a fatigue effect where the jumps are getting slower over time let&amp;#39;s
    take the let&amp;#39;s look at the the average height of the first half of the
    jumps and the last half of the jumps if you&amp;#39;re not careful then you&amp;#39;re
    going to include these fake jumps in your calculation of mean height and now going
    to get a really wacky result which is that the first the the average jump height
    of the first half of the recording is super low and then the second half is super
    high because you have not appropriately cleaned out the false data here so you
    know this is one of those things that&amp;#39;s super obvious when you&amp;#39;re
    looking at it but less so if you&amp;#39;re not careful about how you do your
    analyses so you would want to have um a different way of clipping off and sort
    of to the question from before like this is one of those cases too like if I&amp;#39;m
    writing an automated algorithm to clip off the the beginning and end of the data
    um it&amp;#39;s really hard to write that kind of analysis in a way that&amp;#39;s
    that&amp;#39;s going to get this like I can just go through and say oh yeah right
    it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s here like you can just look at it and say this is where
    the data should start and so I can just go through and find that frame whereas
    if I&amp;#39;m writing some sort of algorithm that&amp;#39;s saying oh look for
    this flat part in the middle how confident am I that I&amp;#39;m going to be able
    to get it right there and not right there that&amp;#39;s going to lead two of
    these like fake jumps in there alternatively I can have a more robust method for
    finding those Peaks that has in addition to that like velocity zero Crossing it
    also just has a minimum threshold height so the thres you have to be above a certain
    height and doing a zero Crossing for it to count as a jump but then you have to
    ask the question how do you know what that height is and da da it&amp;#39;s whole
    part of the game we&amp;#39;ll figure it out um yes and then again those red stars
    he yeah so we believe that those red stars correspond to the apex of the jump
    um and this is that same data in the acceleration space there we go yeah so this
    little humpy thing at the bottom here is in fact the the ballistic flight phase
    so this is again showing that there&amp;#39;s some sort of Squish in the data
    um now again from a data visualization perspective uh Michael was not doing you
    guys any favors because he well he was doing you many many favors I suppose but
    one of the things he didn&amp;#39;t do is maintain a consistent representation
    of maintain consistent coloring because here he established this sort of like
    position is red velocity is green acceleration is blue um but then when he plotted
    it later blue is the default color so he didn&amp;#39;t he didn&amp;#39;t maintain
    those colors throughout so this one oh this is actually is this velocity I think
    that&amp;#39;s labeled wrong what is velocity anyways doesn&amp;#39;t matter um
    so that was now velocity which is blue and this is now acceleration which is blue
    which from a visualization perspective uh there&amp;#39;s nothing different about
    it the shapes aren&amp;#39;t different but in terms of like if you&amp;#39;re
    trying to use this data to communicate a particular thing to an audience maintaining
    those color consistencies can be be really friendly on the brain um but for now
    we don&amp;#39;t have to to worry about it okay so now we get to the a little
    bit of time the end figure it out okay so now I&amp;#39;m going to take a bit
    of a a spin here so this is again just a part of the analyses that you can look
    at all the time so say like you know and these just different ways of interrogating
    the data putting things into position velocity acceleration and sort of finding
    these and I think one of the thing that&amp;#39;s happening with the with the
    red stars is finding particular features in say the velocity signal identifying
    those frame numbers as saying oh this is where the peak of the jump is and then
    plotting those same points overlaid on different analyses so the red star so it&amp;#39;s
    it&amp;#39;s hard to deter in actually yeah so um he didn&amp;#39;t so you could
    have done a similar analysis so this is basically liftoff oh yeah it says right
    there liftoff um so this Frame or close to it is the the part where the feet left
    the ground you could do a similar type of analysis to get TouchDown um and that
    would then tell you that everything between lift off and touchdown is on the ground
    so now even though we know that the that sort of ballistic data is like not accurate
    in some way because you know the this wiggle cannot B physics says that didn&amp;#39;t
    happen so if this is there that means there&amp;#39;s something wrong with the
    data representation which is fine um but we could look at if we knew the the the
    contact portion of the jumps then we then this part of the curve is the place
    where my nervous system is putting Force into the gra round um this is the part
    where I&amp;#39;m landing and absorbing force and this is the part where I&amp;#39;m
    I&amp;#39;m taking off again so using this kind of way of doing the data you could
    chop out all of those contact phases and sort of do some estimations and analyses
    of the um the processes going in there um yeah and then you know keep on doing
    that forever uh uh and then the rest of this starts getting into a place that
    I find particularly fun and evocative and pretty um which starts to show so everything
    up until this point even though the behavior as we know has this kind of repetitive
    phasic structure um we&amp;#39;ve been representing time linearly um and so by
    phase I mean just literally like there is a contact phase and there is a flight
    phase so there&amp;#39;s two phases you might or you might chop it up even more
    than that say the contact phase has two phases there is the compression and then
    there&amp;#39;s the extension phase um you could say that the the flight phase
    has a as a rising phase and a falling phase but you could also if you wanted to
    you could chunk out these times and use that to sort of break down the sorry let
    let me back up a bit so the so we so we know that the behavior has this kind of
    like phasic kind of cyclic sort of circular type of structure to it but the representation
    we have here isn&amp;#39;t showing that time is progressing linearly from start
    to end so from time equals z to time equals bigger than zero in that direction
    so if we wanted to convert that into a more phasic structure that sort of represents
    that that repeated Behavior more we have to do some some trickery um Step One
    is identifying um yeah identifying a discrete moment in particular you want of
    if there&amp;#39;s a phasic thing happening like repeating structure you want
    to have some way of defining the beginning of a phase like what is the what is
    what is so if we&amp;#39;re going from like 0 to Pi 0 to 2 pi we going in a circle
    or something like that that what is zero in that in that phasic structure with
    a calendar we have we call that zero January first um that&amp;#39;s the time
    of the calendar where the number resets uh for a clock we call that time midnight
    it resets and it goes back it goes if you&amp;#39;re counting in military time
    it goes from like 23 59 59 back to zero again um in this case it&amp;#39;s pretty
    reasonable to you could pick any number you could pick any point in this but picking
    that lift off as time equals zero seems like a reasonable place to to do that
    chopping um so we can go through if we wanted to and take all of these oops take
    all of these cycles and clip them according to their starting time and then overlay
    them on top of each other and then you would see you know it would look something
    what would look like so if you were to Overlay all those jumps on top of each
    other and call now zero is just this star you would see this kind of repeating
    structure on top of itself and then sort of then you could try to line things
    up that way um you can also start representing this stuff in a non-spatial way
    so this is this is actually a Time series so it&amp;#39;s actually not spatial
    but the the the the skeleton guy and the dot guy those are all kind of spatial
    representations but when we were talking about representing stuff with plots um
    I talked about like you know you can do X Y and Z to do you know two dimensions
    and three dimensions but then at some point I said that some like that using spatial
    Dimensions to represent the data is not really necessary um you can do any color
    any number of things on the plot um and you can start representing this okay I&amp;#39;m
    going to talk about this just so you know this is like this like gets into the
    kind of like robotics the engineering stuff that like you&amp;#39;re unlikely
    to encounter again for a while unless you seek it out um but uh this starts getting
    into like State space representation um where if you can Define the the the state
    of the system in a small number of numbers then you can represent those numbers
    in a plot and sort of see the relationship between them and so what does that
    mean exactly let let&amp;#39;s think about this in terms of the jumping Behavior
    and the the numbers that we have decided are important for that behavior so there
    is this stage where we have to use our big human brains to decide what are the
    relevant measurable numbers in the system that I&amp;#39;m currently looking at
    and this one of the jumping has this nice feature where we actually kind of boiled
    it down to the point where there&amp;#39;s only a singular sort of basic number
    that we really care about and that&amp;#39;s the Z position um however we then
    made these kind of like derived numbers of velocity and acceleration which we
    also think are very important for understanding the kind of like the physics and
    the mechanics of this jumping behavior um so if we&amp;#39;re thinking about this
    the the jumping human we want to say okay at any given moment in time what are
    some numbers that I really want to know about this object that will help me sort
    of understand what it&amp;#39;s doing we can start by saying I want to know the
    position and I want to know the velocity and we&amp;#39;ll get to the acceleration
    in a second and so and so then just in the same way that if we wanted to plot
    this spatially we could take the XYZ position of the center mass and put it in
    some sort of three dimension representation we can also make a plot where the
    x axis we&amp;#39;re going to call position and the y- axis we&amp;#39;re going
    to call velocity and so at any moment in time you can say okay your your Z position
    is 12 and your velocity is three and so this is your current state at that moment
    in time then we can look at the next time step and say okay well your position
    let&amp;#39;s see your velocity is positive so your position is going to be up
    but your velocity is also going to be dropping because you&amp;#39;re on the air
    and so now you&amp;#39;re going to be there and so you can go through each frame
    and sort of identify the state and then put a data put the put the put a point
    on there and then connect the dots because you know what time is yeah I promise
    you it&amp;#39;s not I think so yeah like there&amp;#39;s a lot of things like
    spatial intuition um we&amp;#39;re very good at that um understanding ballistics
    and understanding velocity like there is this very deep intuitive gut checky level
    where we are all super super good at that like your ability to like jog up the
    stairs catch a ball like all of those things it&amp;#39;s kind of like so the
    like the language that you use like are we really really good at calculus it&amp;#39;s
    like no no no we&amp;#39;re not all like really good at calculus because calculus
    is this weird and specific formalism where these all these like rules of like
    symbols and stuff like that that is but but we are good at what calculus is attempting
    to represent which is like values that change over time and so this is something
    that I&amp;#39;m always kind of trying to to present in these types of sort of
    weird conversations is trying to hit that intuitive level of these things without
    getting bogged down in the numbers and the math and the sort of like the testable
    values um I think this is one of like the main the main harms that we do with
    our stupid way of doing education is because we have this kind of filtration model
    where education is meant to like filter out people who can&amp;#39;t hack it we
    we present this stuff in a way that&amp;#39;s hard on purpose so that we can tell
    who can pass through the filters that we&amp;#39;ve arbitrarily defined the stuff
    um and so people kind of have this sense of like oh the math is hard the the you
    know calculus is hard these sort of weird values are are difficult um but that&amp;#39;s
    that&amp;#39;s something that we did as a society because we&amp;#39;re bad at
    educating on mass or rather I think we&amp;#39;ve outgrown older forms of education
    on mass but that&amp;#39;s like I said this a couple classes ago like if you&amp;#39;re
    like if you&amp;#39;re like oh this makes sense to me you do understand calculus
    um you may just you may not know all the formalism of it you may not know how
    to make your Calculus Professor happy um but if if position if change in position
    over time equals velocity makes sense if change in velocity over time is is acceleration
    makes sense that is calculus and everything else beyond that is just like weird
    syntactic formalisms so and it&amp;#39;s sort of one of these like you hear roboticist
    talking about this a lot of like you know here we are with billion dollars wor
    the military funds trying to make a robot do the most basic thing in the world
    and then here we and then and yet we have like three and fouryear olds just zipping
    around a playground doing all this stuff like once you really start this is also
    kind of like you know human as robot is kind of like a way that I try to make
    sense of like the the complexity of human Mo movement is this kind of like weird
    this weird activity of like trying to boil down these really basic really intuitive
    behaviors and really think about those lowl physics as if you were to build a
    robot that could do this um and often times you just like like how do we know
    that this is stable but that is less stable like how do you know that this is
    this is more likely to fall than that like we all do but actually nailing that
    down in some way that&amp;#39;s interpretable and you know grounded very very
    difficult this thing&amp;#39;s even transparent so like who even knows there&amp;#39;s
    fluids in it Jesus the world is too complicated needs to be simplified um okay
    so State space right at any moment in time there is a state and if you can Define
    that state in a small number of numbers then for every moment in time you can
    put a dot on this thing that represents this is where I am at time equals 12 and
    this is where I am time equals 13 and this is where I am at time equals 14 this
    is where I am at time equals 16 and so you can basically draw these trajectories
    in state space that hypothetically represent the relationship between these values
    and so in particular and so things can kind of emerge from that when you plot
    that stuff that will sort of highlight intuitions that could be hard to identify
    in other formats so like we know because have these sort of gut checks of physics
    and because we&amp;#39;ve been talking about like ballistic movement and stuff
    like that that there is a relationship between the position and height and the
    and the velocity like the Z height and Z position Z velocity are related to each
    other in some way and so we kind of eyeball it in this time series format but
    what would it look like if we could just plot position on one axis and velocity
    on the other axis especially during this type of behavior avior and the answer
    hypothetically plot this here is that so this I don&amp;#39;t know why it&amp;#39;s
    showing up like that so this is this representation for the jump stuff and so
    and I guess the velocity here is on the x axis and the position is on the Y is
    on the Z position is on the vertical axis and the pink dots here are the apex
    of the jump so that&amp;#39;s at your highest position and then the hard to see
    maroon dot here is the the bottom of the jump and then this Green Dot here is
    the liftoff phase um and so you can see so this is a state space representation
    because every dot on this curve represents the the state of the center of mass
    system um at a particular moment in time but it&amp;#39;s not a spatial representation
    there&amp;#39;s nothing in space here because the x axis is velocity that&amp;#39;s
    not you can&amp;#39;t do that like in space you can kind of cheat but otherwise
    not but you can see that this this there&amp;#39;s something intuitive about this
    representation this thing that we always that we knew that there&amp;#39;s a repeated
    cycle going on is now represented here and we can see for example that the Peaks
    are much more lined up than the the liftoffs right because this liftoff is being
    defined there&amp;#39;s something in my nervous system that&amp;#39;s deciding
    this there&amp;#39;s something in the the complicated stuff going on here and
    we could if we really wanted to convert this from a a state space to a proper
    phase space where now the phase space will be something that actually sort of
    rotates around the unit circle and has sort of like you know thetas and fi in
    it and stuff like that um or we could just keep going and make make things even
    wackier and just keep adding numers because this is a two-dimensional State space
    but there&amp;#39;s obviously way more possible numbers we could bake in to the
    state of a system remember this thing has probably like 43 numbers you would need
    to Define its state because it&amp;#39;s got you know joint number times three
    or whatever um but in this case we have an obvious third number and that&amp;#39;s
    acceleration and we believe for good reasons that things like the Z position the
    Z velocity and Z acceleration are all coupled in some way and lucky for us we
    have an additional spatial Dimension to plot and this two-dimensional plot can
    become a threedimensional plot where now the third axis will be acceleration and
    that I believe will show up here and I really wish this would show make this LLY
    I don&amp;#39;t know how to make that show up I don&amp;#39;t know why this is
    anyways do this yeah there we go and so there oh now we&amp;#39;re bouncing around
    so that&amp;#39;s what that looks like uh yeah this is we were getting off of
    Michael&amp;#39;s map too that&amp;#39;s where you got question marks there and
    I wish I could put this in a more visible space but this is one of those so that
    the the height here is acceleration oh Jesus sure um and so now this is a a 3D
    State space representation of that repeative jumping behavior um oh I see got
    this and I wish I had set this up to plot in a bigger format but that&amp;#39;s
    fine I personally really hate Jupiter notebooks but they are useful in some cases
    uh but yeah so this this is the this this is the thre Dimension this is a three-dimensional
    State space plot of the center of mass kinetics over this repeated jumping pattern
    and this if we wanted to we could look and analyze aspects of this shape in similar
    ways that we would analyze three-dimensional spatial trajectories and say things
    that may or may not be related to the actual Behavior now for this particular
    Behavior I kind of think this is where the analysis tends to kind of Peter out
    like just the quality of the data is not particularly great the the experimental
    design was had left something to be desired um but I do think that this is sort
    of like Jesus other than the technical issues um this there&amp;#39;s like something
    beautiful about this and just the way that it represents this kind of like intuitive
    sense of what was going on in that behavior like you can look at it you can say
    okay there&amp;#39;s a repeated thing happening here there&amp;#39;s a cycle that&amp;#39;s
    occurring and I want to know things about that cycle and how that rates relates
    to some other factors that are going on and what we just went through um in the
    full class time because that&amp;#39;s how it always tends to go um was again
    a series of analyses all of these analyses by the way on the back end of the other
    pipeline that we described last time to represent the data in a format that kind
    of captures that cyclical structure and if we really wanted to we could kind of
    look at this and other formats and keep going from there um but and because we
    were so careful and to to maintain that sort of like epistemological chain from
    the base sort of voltages on the back of the camera through each stage of the
    pipeline through the magic box step of the of tracking the person in the image
    and through all the other geometry and computation and you know unit conversion
    and stuff like that we can believe that there is in in the same sense that we
    believe that there is some relationship between the image from the camera and
    the reality of what happens at that point in time now two weeks ago uh where the
    the organism in question was behaving in space we can believe that the the shape
    and structure of this representation also has that grounding in this relationship
    to that behavior that we recorded some weeks ago um yeah and so this type of this
    sort of State space representation it again like I don&amp;#39;t know how much
    it&amp;#39;s going to come up in your daily lives for you know a little while
    unless you sort of stick into the the the gritty parts of science um but you see
    this this method for represent representing complex high-dimensional uh data or
    behaviors or sort of questions in a lot of different places you see it in robotics
    so oftentimes with robotics if you if you think about like a multi-joint arm and
    you think about like you know shoulder shoulder angle uh elbow angle wrist angle
    and you sort of plot those onto this thing then a given arm trajectory will map
    a given trajectory in that space so even if you have a high-dimensional sort of
    robotic element um I think these days people are getting people really like um
    reinforcement learning stuff like that but uh often times like robotic movements
    are deci are defined Within These sort of State spaces and phase spaces and again
    there is nothing special about the number three other than that&amp;#39;s how
    many spatial Dimensions we have if we wanted to plot a 45 dimensional State space
    we could do that we just can&amp;#39;t look at it all at the same time and so
    Robotics trajectories are often plotted in those space spaces you also see it
    in uh neural data so if you&amp;#39;re recording from you know 100 a th000 neurons
    in the visual cortex while you&amp;#39;re displaying something or another to the
    monkey you might want to know about the the firing of each of those neurons relative
    to each other so you could again Define a certain State space and say okay for
    neurons one to 100 you know on the scale from resting firing rate to maximum firing
    rate where is each neuron in that space if you think about a simple case you only
    have three neurons if you show a stimulus to the monkey you can look at how the
    different neurons firing rates relate to each other and look at the structures
    that come around from these types of plots and sort of try to use that to interpret
    what&amp;#39;s going on at the at the neural level um before we go just I&amp;#39;m
    going to drop some just jargon terms real quick if you&amp;#39;re interested in
    this stuff poner sections is a is a classic term it&amp;#39;s been um it a p a
    point section is basically if you take a slice through this um this sort of dut
    shape uh the plunk aray section is sort of like where all those points connect
    so if you were to basically um take a slice here then the shape of the sort of
    intersections with that plane would be the plk array section um you could also
    do like time locking so so this one is just sort of allowed to swing around you
    could also chop it down so that let&amp;#39;s say each of these Green Dots is
    sort of like slammed to zero and then see how the shape changes often times when
    you do that like if you align the time base to some relevant sort of feature different
    things will emerge sometimes things will clean up and sort of condense and you
    can sort of look at things that way um and yeah this is we when we show up before
    class and there then the previous class has all like the crazy math on the board
    that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s differential equations that&amp;#39;s kind of like
    that&amp;#39;s what this stuff starts to get into pretty quickly um but just to
    be clear I can&amp;#39;t do any of that math any of that board math I got nothing
    on that I can probably write code that does similar things to that board math
    but if you sat me down and said calculate the integral of some this that or the
    other like I got I I got nothing you can all probably if any of you have taken
    a math class in the past five years actually probably not five you&amp;#39;re
    pretty young but if you&amp;#39;ve taken a math class at this school you could
    probably math me out of the water on paper um I just never learned how to do that
    my bachelor&amp;#39;s degree is in philosophy um but you can back your way in
    with the intuition and you can learn the co you can learn how to do it in code
    and event like the nice thing about math is once you get good enough at it you
    don&amp;#39;t have to do it anymore you can just kind of write the code that does
    it and the the phase of that process where you actually like I am now back to
    the point where I I I write the math on paper to help me write the code better
    but I promise you I wasn&amp;#39;t doing that for the first like decade or so
    that I was converting my life from philosophy major to science person um Okay
    cool so that&amp;#39;s data that&amp;#39;s movement data that&amp;#39;s probably
    that&amp;#39;s the last moap stuff we&amp;#39;re going to look at unless somebody
    wants to dig deeper into it um I think next week we&amp;#39;re going to focus
    more on the like honing your ideas and I want to end I want to end next week with
    y&amp;#39;all having like three papers on your topic versus the one um and then
    probably after that we&amp;#39;ll move into vision and eyeballs and I&amp;#39;ll
    bring in an eye tracker and we&amp;#39;ll look at my eyeballs and it&amp;#39;ll
    be weird um yeah

    text: "Okay, so catching up, we are here in week five and slowly catching up to\
      \ reality, I suppose. Last week, we recorded some motion capture data involving\
      \ standing posture, jumps, and repeated jumps, and that whole good stuff. Last\
      \ time on Monday, we looked pretty closely at that data, focusing on the epistemological\
      \ chain\u2014from the empirical measurement represented by the video recordings\
      \ into the increasingly complex analyses and processes that produce the data\
      \ into a format we could actually analyze, understand, and make insights about\
      \ the standing posture. We specifically looked at the differences between the\
      \ supported versus the unsupported stances, trying to wrap our heads around\
      \ that way of looking at data. \n\nI hope that was generally helpful for this\
      \ specific type of data, but also that the same thought process applies to any\
      \ kind of scientific investigation. At some level, if you're trying to derive\
      \ knowledge about the world based on empirical measurement, there will always\
      \ be a process similar to what we went through last time. There will be some\
      \ tool taking measurements from the world, and that measurement will be based\
      \ on some fundamental energy or quantity that we can record. Generally speaking,\
      \ that data will not be something you can just look at and derive meaningful\
      \ information about the world; there will have to be a process of calibration,\
      \ computation, and analysis. At the end of that sometimes lengthy computational\
      \ pipeline, you'll look at data represented in some way and try to generate\
      \ knowledge about the world from that. \n\nThe main point I wanted to make last\
      \ time is to think about each stage of that process as a sort of chain of epistemological\
      \ grounding, where your ability to trust the outcome of that long pipeline is\
      \ only as strong as the weakest link in that analysis. If there's a problematic\
      \ step in Step 12 of 255, for example, even if every other step is grounded\
      \ and reliable, that flawed step means everything after it may no longer accurately\
      \ reflect reality. \n\nToday, I'm going to do two things, which is often considered\
      \ a mistake, but I think we can manage it. I want to go back into the data and\
      \ look at some of the data we didn\u2019t examine before, specifically the last\
      \ condition of the repeated jumping. I'll show you an analysis of that data\
      \ generated in previous years to make a couple of different points. This will\
      \ illustrate the different structure of a movement that has a repetitive phasic\
      \ aspect to it. \n\nUnlike standing posture, which is a continuous control problem,\
      \ or a singular jump, which is a discrete behavior, repeated jumping has a phasic\
      \ nature where each stage sets you up for the next iteration. There are various\
      \ ways of analyzing data like this; many aspects of the natural world exhibit\
      \ this property. For instance, locomotion, running, circadian rhythms, and the\
      \ seasons all have this structure of repeating patterns that relate to linear\
      \ time but are not directly correlated to it. Seasons represent this concept\
      \ well; the year progresses numerically but unfolds at its own pace. Hopefully,\
      \ discussing this won't take too long. \n\nI want to leave the last hour\u2014\
      optimistically\u2014perhaps less, for some small group work. This will involve\
      \ forming groups of roughly three people, intending to find a paper that complements\
      \ the paper you\u2019ve already chosen for your topic. Specifically, I\u2019\
      d like you to find papers on a similar topic that present distinct perspectives,\
      \ allowing you to explore different angles on your chosen subject. I believe\
      \ this will smoothly lead us into the second half of the semester. By the end\
      \ of next week, I want you to have a grounded sense of what your final poster\
      \ project will look like and start making hypothetical movements in that direction.\
      \ I realize some awkward timing exists here, but don\u2019t stress too much;\
      \ we will make it work. \n\nJust to clarify, the poster upload deadline isn't\
      \ as stringent as it might appear. This is the hard deadline; you must upload\
      \ your poster for printing in time for the event. Everything before that point\
      \ is a bit more flexible. I aim to have this done before spring break, which\
      \ will hopefully free you from that responsibility, although there is some inherent\
      \ ambiguity in the timeline. \n\nIs everyone doing okay with that so far? Any\
      \ assignment anxieties? Good. Regarding exams, we are going to call it an exam\
      \ for bureaucratic reasons, but it will be another one of these directed, bot-based\
      \ conversations. Specifically, I will extract the philosophical aspects of science\
      \ from the past several lectures about units, recordings, and empirical measurements.\
      \ You will engage in a directed conversation with the AI about connecting those\
      \ thoughts to your chosen domain of study. I can\u2019t imagine anyone has selected\
      \ a topic that doesn't relate to units and measurements or methodology. \n\n\
      We will call it an exam, but it won't be graded because I believe it\u2019s\
      \ unethical to use AI for grading due to various reasons. We'll manage just\
      \ fine with it. \n\nNow, I need to start up Discord, which may take a moment.\
      \ I've moved the recordings from last week into a Google Drive folder for you\
      \ to download if you wish; I won\u2019t go into detail about that. In the server,\
      \ under links and resources, there's a Google Drive link that should lead you\
      \ to a page showing the recordings in some strange order. Later in the semester,\
      \ I might explain more about how to access and run them, but for now, my only\
      \ recommendation is that if you want to look at any of these on your computer,\
      \ your best bet is to download the entire folder instead of bits and pieces.\
      \ Download the whole folder of a given recording, open the blend file with Blender,\
      \ and poke around. If you don\u2019t know how to use Blender, there are countless\
      \ tutorials online to help you figure that out. \n\nWith that said, let's take\
      \ a look at this repeated jumps recording."

    text: "If you recall, this will come up later. Noticing that the initial data\
      \ here is broken garbage because I am not in the scene, everything gets squished\
      \ into a singular line. This is a very common way that data breaks when you're\
      \ trying to do 3D work with bad input. Just note that the data starts out as\
      \ garbage and then it snaps into place whenever I walk into the scene and stand\
      \ in that calibration pose. I then start bouncing up and down. If we hide this,\
      \ we can look at that and I think we can do that. I never know how to make that\
      \ work; it's fine. Okay, so we\u2019re going to say round frame, do two seconds\
      \ before and not after, and then we're going to calculate the whole recording.\
      \ Then we'll hide the keyframes and show a custom color, making it pink. So\
      \ here I am, jumping for some amount of time. I guess we\u2019ll get to that\
      \ when we get there. Let's look at the graph editor. So with the standing posture\
      \ stuff, we were looking at the projection of the center of mass onto the floor\
      \ relative to the base of support. For that task, the height of the center of\
      \ mass is not relevant to the analysis. We only really care about where that\
      \ center of mass position is on the ground plane, which we\u2019ll define as\
      \ XY, and then Z will be the vertical axis in this world. In that balance task,\
      \ X and Y are the relevant dimensions; Z is not a relevant dimension for the\
      \ model of standing we're looking at. If we were analyzing a more complex model\
      \ of standing that included joint angles and other factors, we might care about\
      \ the Z-axis. But because we're in this sort of hyper-simplified world, we can\
      \ essentially ignore the height of the center of mass. Now we've boiled down\
      \ this complex motion data object into two singular points. With something like\
      \ jumping, it's the opposite. When I'm jumping around, we consider that as applying\
      \ force into the ground that counteracts gravity. If I apply more force into\
      \ the ground than my weight, where weight is measured in Newtons (which is mass\
      \ times gravity), I temporarily leave the ground because gravity pulls that\
      \ energy away from me. I reach a certain height and then come back down. This\
      \ behavior is defined relative to an inertial reference frame, which is essentially\
      \ code for the ground being at zero with some direction pointing up. When I\
      \ jump here, there, or over there, it's the same process. For this task, we\
      \ only care about the Z-axis, the vertical axis. If the task specified jumping\
      \ in place without shifting around, then the ground plane becomes important.\
      \ However, if we're considering the base-level physics, the physics remain the\
      \ same regardless of which part of the room I'm in. This is a long-winded way\
      \ of saying that I can turn off the X and Y data from this viewer and normalize\
      \ that. I am not sure why it looks like that, but okay. Now we have this nice\
      \ data. It shows the vertical motion of my center of mass. The X-axis here is\
      \ hypothetically in meters, but it's upside down. I don't know why it's upside\
      \ down. These units are confusing me a bit because it shows negative 0.85 and\
      \ negative 0.9, which is downwards, but it also says 1.43 meters, which is probably\
      \ this high. Let's assume this is about 1.4 meters. I could probably jump that\
      \ high; it seems right. I don't know why these units are happening. I've noted\
      \ that Blender is not a scientific tool; it's an artistic animation tool, so\
      \ things like making sure all the units are correct are sometimes a bit more\
      \ ambiguous than you would expect from scientific tools. But this issue is more\
      \ cultural than a problem with the math. For this type of work, they need to\
      \ do the calculations correctly and keep track of units. However, the user base\
      \ of this software is often more concerned with the general shapes of the data,\
      \ so sometimes the numbers don\u2019t match what you would expect. This is probably\
      \ just a setting that I'm not properly adjusting, but a scientific tool wouldn't\
      \ have this issue; an artistic tool would. Fortunately, in this context, I don\u2019\
      t really care about the values; I only care about the shapes. This provides\
      \ a nice opportunity to look at how this non-dimensionalization works. By dropping\
      \ the X and Y data from this plot, we simplify the data into a one-dimensional\
      \ time series. The X-axis represents time, specifically the frame number. If\
      \ you wanted to calculate the clock time, we could convert that using our knowledge\
      \ of the frame rate and similar factors. Notice that as I'm at the bottom of\
      \ the jump, I jump up. In the actual 3D data, I\u2019m kind of shifting around\
      \ in space; I\u2019m not just bouncing over the origin the whole time, my X\
      \ and Y values are changing, but we don\u2019t need to care about that if we\u2019\
      re just looking at height. From a mechanical perspective, we could convert this\
      \ into Newtons by calculating the potential energy based on height. Mass remains\
      \ constant, and gravity does not change. If we wanted to convert this plot into\
      \ a representation of the potential energy of the physical system, we could\
      \ simply scale it by my mass and the gravity on Earth. If we did that, the numbers\
      \ would change, but the shape would remain the same because nothing particularly\
      \ interesting is happening there. There are a lot of things we could explore\
      \ if we had more time and research funding. One area of interest might be, if\
      \ we were like sports biomechanists, understanding the force production that\
      \ leads into jumping. We might want to look at the phase on the ground more\
      \ closely. Can I zoom in more?"

    text: "Here I am at the top of the jump. As I come down, looking at the video\
      \ back there, you can tell right around here that I\u2019m off the ground. This\
      \ frame is where I hit the ground. No, wait, that\u2019s not right; that\u2019\
      s the opposite. Okay, right around here, during this phase where I\u2019m on\
      \ the ground, you can see that I\u2019m kind of compressing. I have a lot of\
      \ mechanical energy in the system that has to go somewhere. I bend my legs;\
      \ I don\u2019t have EMG recording the muscles on my quadriceps and hamstrings\
      \ or whatever, but they\u2019re on, I promise you that, because I don\u2019\
      t collapse to the ground. My legs just kind of deform a little bit, and then\
      \ I push off and return to the air.\n\nThis is where we\u2019ve come across\
      \ the term neuromechanics before. We could ask questions at this level about\
      \ how efficient I am as an organism at taking advantage of the fact that the\
      \ force of gravity is preloading my muscles with this nice spring force. Then,\
      \ how efficiently do I utilize that spring force to launch myself off the ground\
      \ for the next jump? Clearly, when I push off, something from above is sending\
      \ the signal down to trigger muscle firing that allows me to bounce off the\
      \ ground. Unlike the standing high jump, I don\u2019t have to generate all that\
      \ force on my own; I have some of the force from the previous jump preloading\
      \ my limbs. When I take off in the next jump, the force from my muscles is presumably\
      \ efficiently combined with the spring force from the previous jump. It gets\
      \ complicated very quickly.\n\nSo, we could look at how efficiently I\u2019\
      m doing that translation from one jump to the other. We could also examine things\
      \ like fatigue. If we expected that over the course of these jumps\u2014which\
      \ look pretty similar\u2014it might be the case that if you looked at the time\
      \ between the peaks, it might get longer as I get more tired. The peak height\
      \ might decrease a bit as I get fatigued. I wasn\u2019t really pushing myself\
      \ all that hard, and it wasn\u2019t a particularly long recording, so if those\
      \ numbers show up, they might be more subtle. However, there are many potential\
      \ analyses and ways of considering this data. This is only possible because\
      \ of the repetitive aspect of it.\n\nAgain, the bouncing in place serves as\
      \ a proxy for what it would look like if I were running, jogging, or walking\u2014\
      any of those repeated behaviors. While the data in the middle looks nice, it\u2019\
      s important to consider what bad data looks like. One of the real advantages\
      \ of this type of data is that it is directly coupled to something we have strong\
      \ intuitions about because it\u2019s human movement. It\u2019s video, and we\
      \ kind of have some sense of what that data looks like. If this were a measurement\
      \ from an accelerometer or a mass spectrometer\u2014something less tied to our\
      \ everyday experiences\u2014it might not be as obvious when the data is good\
      \ versus when it\u2019s flawed due to some methodological issue.\n\nWhen analyzing\
      \ data, you always have to be asking yourself, \"Am I looking at signal or am\
      \ I looking at noise?\" The signal-to-noise ratio is a whole other conversation,\
      \ but this is where building intuitions and understanding is crucial. You should\
      \ have that gut check of whether you\u2019re looking at something worth analyzing\
      \ or some sort of noise and bugs in the system. This can often be the challenging\
      \ part. Also, notice that this will come up later: at some point on my way out,\
      \ there\u2019s a spike where one frame jumps unexpectedly. There\u2019s one\
      \ data point that is way outside the expected range, which will become relevant\
      \ later.\n\nOkay, that should make rough sense. Let\u2019s now look at ways\
      \ of representing this data that can help us understand it better, starting\
      \ to shape the data into something more amenable for analysis. For that, I\u2019\
      m going to show you a little bit of code. This code is in the course repository\
      \ now. If you\u2019re familiar with Python, particularly Jupyter notebooks,\
      \ it\u2019s available there. It's not necessarily well set up for students,\
      \ but it is available if you want to find it in the code folder within the Python\
      \ directory. We\u2019re looking at jumping and the center of mass, and this\
      \ should run.\n\nSo, I\u2019m not going to delve too much into the code parts\
      \ of it. Just doing a quick pass through; interested parties can pay attention\
      \ while uninterested parties may just wait for the squiggly lines and pretty\
      \ pictures. You\u2019ll hear me talk a lot about writing code, doing analysis,\
      \ and so on. Just FYI, this is what that looks like.\n\nThe first thing you\
      \ do is install some packages. This is Python code, and you need packages like\
      \ NumPy for numerical computations, SciPy for scientific analysis, and Plotly\
      \ for making visual plots and graphs. These packages were made by many people\
      \ over many years. NumPy, in particular, has a lineage that goes back to the\
      \ early history of computing. There\u2019s always been a de facto best numerical\
      \ computation package, and I think these days NumPy is probably the most widely\

      \ the center csb data files that I showed last time, but they are equivalent.\
      \ This is the part where that data gets into the program; it\u2019s then loaded\
      \ into the RAM and memory of the system. When we want to look at it, this is\
      \ the part where the computer has loaded that data in. Those big, infinite piles\
      \ of numbers that I was showing last time are now present in the system\u2019\
      s memory, and we can observe them. You can load and look at its shape, where\
      \ this shape shows the center of mass. It's 1370 by 3, meaning 1,370 frames\
      \ at 30 frames per second with three columns for X, Y, and Z. When we talk about\
      \ the shape of the data, that\u2019s what we're discussing: the number of frames,\
      \ the number of dimensions. If it included rotation, it would be six dimensions,\
      \ so that would be XYZ position and XYZ rotation, resulting in 1370 by 6. There\
      \ are different data points there, and I think I might have to restart this\
      \ when I run it since it seems basic enough for it to happen. Now, the data\
      \ has shown up in the system, and this is a very basic plot of that. This is\
      \ the raw data, likely plotted using Plotly or something similar. It is the\
      \ same data that you see in Blender, but in a much more limited form. One of\
      \ the main achievements of the Primo Cap software was figuring out how to adapt\
      \ the low-level scientific code so it could be integrated into this animation\
      \ software. This allows you to do nice things and navigate without having to\
      \ write the actual code. However, because this is an artist's tool, it isn\u2019\
      t really set up for deeper layers of analysis. For a lot of scientific analysis,\
      \ this would already be quite good because it\u2019s a 3D animation, but you\
      \ can easily see how this isn\u2019t as useful as a more professional animation\
      \ software designed for 3D work. It offers an interesting intersection between\
      \ art and heavy technical computational 3D math. Blender, in particular, as\
      \ a free open-source software, represents that intersection. This method is\
      \ also an excellent way to confirm that you\u2019ve loaded the data correctly.\
      \ Up is indeed in the correct direction. It is very common for the data to load\
      \ incorrectly, resulting in a snowstorm of dots flying around, or having the\
      \ person appear to jump sideways because you haven\u2019t rotated things correctly.\
      \ In our case, Z needs to be up since much of what we are discussing assumes\
      \ that one of the axes corresponds with the gravity vector. However, the raw\
      \ geometry lacks an actual representation of gravity; cameras don\u2019t inherently\
      \ know what gravity is unless you have a secondary sensor in them, which we\
      \ do not. This visualization is not a necessary step in the analysis pipeline,\
      \ but on a practical level, it is essential for ensuring what we call observability\
      \ in your pipeline. Observability is when, while crunching big numbers with\
      \ complex code, you produce something that you can visually inspect, using your\
      \ human eyes and brain, to confirm that it looks correct\u2014like a person\
      \ jumping or being oriented with gravity. Once you see that, you can be confident\
      \ to continue to the next stages of the data analysis pipeline. I can\u2019\
      t remember who originally wrote this, but I always notice details like the British\
      \ spelling of 'analyzing' with an 's' instead of a 'z.' I\u2019m not sure if\
      \ that was me or someone else. \n\nWe\u2019ve talked about time series, but\
      \ this is not a time series; it is a spatial representation of the data. There\
      \ is actually nothing in this data that indicates what time is. It just happens\
      \ to plot the data over time at roughly 30 frames per second. You can observe\
      \ it for time visually by looking at the movement; however, this representation\
      \ is purely spatial\u2014none of these axes represent time; they are X, Y, and\
      \ Z. We can represent this in a time series format, splitting it so it can be\
      \ flat. We have X, Y, and Z, and this axis represents time, specifically frame\
      \ number. We are not in SI units here. If this were to be in SI units, it would\
      \ have to be seconds, but this is in frames. To convert this to seconds, you\
      \ would multiply by 0.033 or something similar, which represents the number\
      \ of seconds per frame. Doing some calculations will give you seconds per frame.\
      \ One of the peculiar aspects of this part of calculus is realizing that you\
      \ can perform the same type of fraction math for units that you would for numbers,\
      \ and it remains valid. For example, you can derive 33 milliseconds per frame\
      \ from 30 frames per second. \n\nBefore, when I was showing this, I had already\
      \ truncated the end frame to be before the actual end of the recording. Remember\
      \ when I pointed out that one odd spiky dot at the end of the recording? If\
      \ I don\u2019t account for that and simply plot all of the data, something on\
      \ this computer will eventually crash. It may look like this: because I said\
      \ to plot X, Y, and Z relative to the frame number, it complies. However, something\
      \ about the data, a huge outlier spike, complicates the visualization. This\
      \ plot spans from zero to 15,000. I don\u2019t know if you remember last time,\
      \ but I didn\u2019t actually fly 15,000 meters into the sky; that did not occur.\
      \ In millimeters, it seems absurd; 15,000 millimeters into the sky\u2014a blobby\
      \ data spike. I could resolve this issue using intuition, commanding the code\
      \ to restrict the Y limit to show a specific range of numbers, but I\u2019m\
      \ unsure what that range should be. Alternatively, I can specify in the code\
      \ that the start frame is zero and the end frame as negative one, which means\
      \ just the last frame. This again reinforces the significance of observability,\
      \ as I can delve into the code and ascertain that the first chunk of data is\
      \ non-valid until frame 118, maybe 150 is when the good data starts, and it\
      \ remains accurate until..."

      \ like that weird spike, it looks like this. Oftentimes, when we need to do\
      \ data collection, if you're doing this, you're typically repeating the same\
      \ actions across multiple participants, conditions, and days. Therefore, you\
      \ really want your pipelines to require as little human intervention as possible.\
      \ You want to avoid steps where you have to manually analyze the data, like\
      \ determining the start and end frames. That manual labor requires cognitive\
      \ effort, making it inefficient.\n\nYou should be able to load the data, click\
      \ go, come back tomorrow, and record new data without having to sort through\
      \ numbers. However, in practice, there will always be some level of data cleaning\
      \ and preparation necessary. If this were part of a longer study, I would have\
      \ a system to record essential details, like for data collection day, participant,\
      \ condition, start frame, and end frame to track this over time. This way, when\
      \ I conduct the main analysis, I know I'm reviewing only the relevant data.\n\
      \nIt would be difficult to select a frame number like we did using a duration.\
      \ For example, if I wanted to extract 30 seconds and I'm working at 30 frames\
      \ per second, that equates to around 900 frames. However, I couldn't specify\
      \ a range like frame 150 to frame 932 easily. A more common approach is to select\
      \ durations and define a behavior that allows for straightforward data extraction\
      \ analytically.\n\nFor instance, if I instruct someone to stand still for five\
      \ seconds and then jump repeatedly, with another five-second pause at the end,\
      \ the recorded data would show flat sections. This could easily be coded to\
      \ analyze the velocity and automatically extract the initial and final data\
      \ points. With my current skills, I could write that code quickly and trust\
      \ its reliability, but it took time and effort to develop that ability. If you\
      \ record a sufficient amount of data, the automated pipeline might work correctly\
      \ 90% of the time. However, in the 10% of cases where something unusual happens,\
      \ it could disrupt the data for one participant, and this may not be noticed\
      \ until much later.\n\nThis situation illustrates the balancing act between\
      \ automating processes for efficiency versus manually identifying specific data\
      \ points for each participant. Following that, I might maintain a separate CSV\
      \ file that simply records participant numbers, conditions, start frames, and\
      \ end frames, which allows for quick data entry without complex coding. This\
      \ is a common dilemma in graduate school related to efficiency and productivity,\
      \ where one often feels trapped in indecision about whether to automate or do\
      \ it manually.\n\nRegarding the analysis of behavior, when we look at the X,\
      \ Y, and Z axes, it's clear that the task is well-defined along the Z-axis,\
      \ showing consistent regularity in the data. This regularity allows us to identify\
      \ something scientifically tractable, unlike the more noisy data where no distinct\
      \ structure appears. In contrast, we can see some jumping behavior in the shape,\
      \ but this could also indicate an error in the data collection pipeline.\n\n\
      In analyzing the dimensions, if the task required jumping only on a penny placed\
      \ on the ground, then deviations in the X and Y dimensions would contribute\
      \ to understanding the behavior. For this analysis, however, we will focus solely\
      \ on the Z-axis, which refers to vertical height. This brings us to the terms\
      \ kinetics and kinematics. In human movement studies, kinematics pertains to\
      \ elements like joint angles and body posture, whereas kinetics relates to forces\
      \ acting on the body, including applied forces, torques, and others.\n\nSince\
      \ we're focusing on the Z direction, this aligns with kinetic potential energy,\
      \ making our analysis kinetic. We utilize a Butterworth filter to smooth the\
      \ data, which is just a method of cleaning the data \u2013 don't worry too much\
      \ about the technical details now. \n\nDuring this process, we convert frame\
      \ numbers into seconds because later on we will calculate Z velocity and Z acceleration\
      \ based on these Z positions. When computing acceleration, it's essential to\
      \ have time in seconds, as velocity in meters per frame isn't particularly useful.\
      \ While this approach has a hardcoded frame rate of 30, going forward, it's\
      \ preferable to source the frame rate from the data to ensure consistency across\
      \ future analyses with varying frame rates. For now, as we are experimenting,\
      \ this won't pose an issue."

    text: "Calculus, real quick. So if this is time and this is height, this is the\
      \ position in height in space off the ground. You can differentiate. The numerical\
      \ derivative, or np.diff, is a calculation that essentially takes the difference.\
      \ It literally just says, \"Okay, for each frame, subtract the previous one\
      \ from the current one.\" And then, instead of having the Z position for each\
      \ frame, you have the difference between each data point and the one that came\
      \ before it. This gives you the change in Z position over the duration of time\
      \ defined by one frame. That is now Delta, where if we're using meters, Delta\
      \ meters over some measure of time is velocity. That's calculus for you. If\
      \ you apply np.diff to the velocity, now you're getting the change in velocity\
      \ over a frame's duration of time, which is acceleration. Again, np.diff is\
      \ the numerical derivative for discrete time intervals. In traditional calculus,\
      \ you work with limits and smooth functions, but in the computational numerical\
      \ world, we just perform that operation and call it good. The integral is done\
      \ in a similar way; it\u2019s sort of the opposite. So if you plot it again\u2014\
      oh, we still don\u2019t have those numbers. I need to propagate this thing.\
      \ Okay, that's the plot. I want that to start at frame 150, where was it, 1200,\
      \ or whatever, and total body center of mass will span from start frame to end\
      \ frame. If I do that, it will give me a smaller number. Yes, that\u2019s another\
      \ common mistake. I had changed the start and end frame parameters for the visualization,\
      \ but I hadn\u2019t actually clipped the actual data. So when it got to the\
      \ next part, where it was calculating velocities, it included those erroneous\
      \ frames. If you think about velocity as the change in position over the unit\
      \ in time, that one frame where I jumped to 15,000 mm in the back has a velocity\
      \ through the roof, because the jump in position is also significant\u2014literally\
      \ through the roof, I suppose. Now, if we do this again, there you go. Now it\u2019\
      s more cleaned up. Can I look at this? So, let\u2019s see. Let\u2019s look at\
      \ this area around 400. This is the Z position, which represents the height\
      \ position occurring there. This shows what the velocity looks like, roughly\
      \ aligned, and this is what the Z acceleration looks like. Then, this is what\
      \ they look like overlaid. This is one of those places where I think we\u2019\
      re going to get a chance to revisit later, but if this were a perfect measurement,\
      \ then there should be frames where, during the jump, the acceleration should\
      \ be negative 10 m/s down. I\u2019m pretty sure that this actually... I can\
      \ tell you that. So, 398 is a peak and 398 is down here. The low part here is\
      \ the section where I\u2019m in ballistic flight. The fact that there\u2019\
      s a little hump there indicates that the data is somewhat incorrect; either\
      \ my center of mass is not calculated perfectly, or in this case, I think the\
      \ world is tilted a little bit. The ground plane is not actually flat; it\u2019\
      s slightly tilted, which I think is also the reason you\u2019re seeing those\
      \ jump squiggles in the X and Y axes. Think about jumping on a slanted ground\
      \ plane: even if you're moving up and down in space, you will still see some\
      \ of that reflected in the X and Y axes. I know this because I wrote this code,\
      \ and I recognize that part of the code introduces some error. But, yes, we\
      \ can now chunk this out and start using this data to extract particular layers.\
      \ I don\u2019t know why, but anytime I have a plan that involves the word 'and',\
      \ I should just scrap it and have two separate things. It\u2019s already 4 o\u2019\
      clock, so we don't have time for the other thing. Are we going to do this and\
      \ that? I\u2019m starting to recognize it, but I don\u2019t use that to change\
      \ my behavior. We'll figure that out. Using this data, for example, one of the\
      \ simple analyses you might want to conduct is how many times did I jump? If\
      \ the task was to jump as many times as you can in 30 seconds or until you want\
      \ to stop, just being able to count these jumps would be really helpful. You\
      \ could eyeball it; just count them by hand, but, first of all, that\u2019s\
      \ not very reliable, and, secondly, it won\u2019t scale. If you\u2019re doing\
      \ a larger analysis, you want to automate that. There are various ways of doing\
      \ that, and in this particular case, I\u2019m pretty sure Michael wrote this\
      \ code\u2014he's identifying peaks in the jump as zero crossings in the velocity.\
      \ In particular, he\u2019s looking at this stage. If you think about the velocity\
      \ of a curve\u2014can I zoom in on that?\u2014up and down, I\u2019m accelerating\
      \ upwards, so it\u2019s positive velocity. I hit the apex, and then I\u2019\
      m going downward, so it\u2019s negative velocity. There\u2019s a zero crossing\
      \ between positive and negative velocity, which corresponds to the peak of the\
      \ jump. That\u2019s useful because, if you\u2019re trying to identify the peak\
      \ of a jump, you can do that pretty easily just by examining the data. However,\
      \ there will always be some ambiguous moments. For this data point, for example,\
      \ this one is pretty obvious\u2014this is probably the peak you want to pick.\
      \ But if you\u2019re trying to select just the highest one, there can be some\
      \ ambiguous moments. You\u2019re looking for a particular number, and that\u2019\
      s where things like converting to velocity allow you to look for zero crossings,\
      \ where the data goes from positive to negative. That becomes very easy to pick\
      \ out of the data."

      s another quick tip for data visualizations. This is a bad representation of\
      \ data. It's fine, and this is him showing, okay, we are using that velocity\
      \ analysis; you can find the peaks of each jump. Then you can just count the\
      \ number of those and know how many times you jumped. But the yellow on white\
      \ is not doing anyone any favors. So we are going to go in here. This is a highlight\
      \ program; you see where it says yellow? I'm going to change that to a different\
      \ color, say magenta. There we go, or let's say red. Sure. So now we have the\
      \ number of steps here. I just want to say this out loud: when you\u2019re doing\
      \ data, if you have healthy color vision, you will very quickly go to red and\
      \ green as the colors to show two different groups. However, you are not allowed\
      \ to use red and green; 10% of the population is color blind. If these were\
      \ green lines with red dots, then 10% of my audience could not see that color\
      \ distinction. So think about using other colors. Red and blue is good; blue\
      \ and yellow, well, not that yellow; blue and orange. Anyway, think about color-blind\
      \ people. \n\nThis is also a good example: despite the fact that we had a pretty\
      \ nice algorithm for finding the peaks of those jumps, it finds a bunch of jumps\
      \ right here. The algorithm is somewhat simplistic; it\u2019s just looking for\
      \ zero crossings. So when I am just standing here, moving a little bit, it\u2019\
      s identifying those points. If we are naive in the way we conduct this analysis,\
      \ we will count five extra jumps at the beginning that did not actually occur.\
      \ If we wanted to analyze whether there is a fatigue effect where the jumps\
      \ are getting slower over time, let\u2019s look at the average height of the\
      \ first half of the jumps compared to the last half. If you\u2019re not careful,\
      \ you will include these false jumps in your calculation of mean height, leading\
      \ to a really wacky result: the average jump height of the first half of the\
      \ recording could be super low, while the second half could be super high because\
      \ you have not appropriately cleaned out the false data. This is one of those\
      \ things that\u2019s super obvious when you are looking at it but less so if\
      \ you\u2019re not careful about how you do your analyses. \n\nYou would want\
      \ to find a different way of clipping off data. In response to a previous question,\
      \ this is one of those cases: if I\u2019m writing an automated algorithm to\
      \ clip off the beginning and end of the data, it\u2019s really hard to write\
      \ that kind of analysis that gets this right. I can just look at it and say,\
      \ this is where the data should start, and find that frame. However, if I'm\
      \ writing some sort of algorithm saying, look for this flat part in the middle,\
      \ how confident am I that I\u2019m going to get it right, there? This can lead\
      \ to fake jumps being included. Alternatively, I could have a more robust method\
      \ for finding the peaks that includes a minimum threshold height, meaning you\
      \ have to be above a certain height while doing a zero crossing for it to count\
      \ as a jump. However, you have to ask the question, how do you determine what\
      \ that height is? That is part of the task. \n\nAnd again, those red stars;\
      \ yes, we believe those correspond to the apex of the jump. This is the same\
      \ data in the acceleration space. The little humpy thing at the bottom here\
      \ is, in fact, the ballistic flight phase. This again shows that there\u2019\
      s some squishing in the data. From a data visualization perspective, Michael\
      \ did not do you any favors. He established that position is red, velocity is\
      \ green, and acceleration is blue, but when he plotted it later, blue was the\
      \ default color, so he didn\u2019t maintain those colors throughout. This now\
      \ shows velocity, which is blue, and now acceleration, which is also blue. From\
      \ a visualization perspective, there\u2019s nothing different; the shapes aren\u2019\
      t different. However, if you\u2019re trying to use this data to communicate\
      \ something to an audience, maintaining color consistency can be friendly for\
      \ the brain. \n\nBut for now, we don\u2019t have to worry about it. Now, let\u2019\
      s take a bit of a spin. This is just a part of the analyses you can look at\
      \ all the time. These are just different ways of interrogating the data, putting\
      \ things into position, velocity, acceleration, and finding patterns. One of\
      \ the things that\u2019s happening with the red stars is they are identifying\
      \ specific features in the velocity signal, marking those frame numbers, and\
      \ saying, oh, this is where the peak of the jump is. Then we overlay those points\
      \ on different analyses. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to determine the specifics, but\
      \ you could conduct a similar analysis for liftoff. This frame, or close to\
      \ it, marks the moment when the feet leave the ground. You could apply a similar\
      \ type of analysis to identify touchdown, informing you that everything between\
      \ liftoff and touchdown means the individual is on the ground. Even though we\
      \ recognize that the ballistic data may not be accurate because this wiggle\
      \ cannot occur physically, something is wrong with the data representation,\
      \ which is acceptable. However, if we know the contact portions of the jumps,\
      \ we can analyze where my nervous system is applying force into the ground,\
      \ where I am landing and absorbing force, and when I am taking off again. Using\
      \ this framework, we can remove all those contact phases and conduct estimations\
      \ and analyses of the processes involved. You can keep analyzing it forever.\n\
      \nThe rest of this begins to explore ideas that I personally find particularly\
      \ enjoyable, evocative, and aesthetically pleasing. Up until this point, even\
      \ though the behavior has this repetitive phasic structure, we have been representing\
      \ time linearly. By phasic, I mean there is a contact phase and a flight phase.\
      \ You might break down the contact phase into two phases: compression and extension.\
      \ You could say that the flight phase has a rising phase and a falling phase.\
      \ If you wanted to, you could chunk these phases out and use that to delineate...\
      \ \n\nLet me back up a bit. We know that behavior has this cyclic, phasic, circular\
      \ structure, but our representation here does not show that time is progressing\
      \ linearly from start to end. If we want to convert this into a more phasic\
      \ structure that represents the repeated behavior, we must employ some trickery."

    text: "Identifying a discrete moment in particular, if there is a phasic event\
      \ happening, such as a repeating structure, you want to have some way of defining\
      \ the beginning of a phase. For example, if we are going from 0 to pi, or from\
      \ 0 to 2 pi, we are going in a circle. So, what is zero in that phasic structure?\
      \ With a calendar, we call that zero January first; that\u2019s the time of\
      \ the calendar when the number resets. For a clock, we call that time midnight,\
      \ when it resets and goes back. If you\u2019re counting in military time, it\
      \ goes from 23:59:59 back to zero again. In this case, it is reasonable to select\
      \ any number, but picking liftoff as time equals zero seems like a reasonable\
      \ place to make that cut. \n\nWe can go through and take all of these cycles\
      \ and clip them according to their starting time, and then overlay them on top\
      \ of each other. You would see something that looks like this: if you were to\
      \ overlay all those jumps and call now zero as just this star, you would observe\
      \ some kind of repeating structure on top of itself. Then, you could try to\
      \ line things up that way. \n\nYou can also begin representing this information\
      \ in a non-spatial way. This is actually a time series; it is not spatial. The\
      \ skeleton figure and the dot figure are spatial representations, but when we\
      \ talk about representing data with plots, we can use two dimensions or three\
      \ dimensions. However, at some point, I mentioned that using spatial dimensions\
      \ to represent the data is not always necessary. You can use any color and any\
      \ number of variations on the plot. \n\nNow I\u2019m going to talk about state\
      \ space representation. Here, if you can define the state of the system with\
      \ a small number of values, you can represent those values in a plot and see\
      \ the relationships between them. What does that mean exactly? Let\u2019s consider\
      \ this in terms of the jumping behavior and the numbers we have identified as\
      \ important for that behavior. \n\nIn this context of jumping, we have boiled\
      \ it down to a single basic number that we really care about: the Z position.\
      \ However, we also derived important numbers such as velocity and acceleration,\
      \ which we think are crucial for understanding the physics and mechanics of\
      \ this jumping behavior. \n\nIf we observe a jumping human, we might want to\
      \ know a few key numbers at any given moment to help understand what the object\
      \ is doing. We would start by stating we want to know the position and the velocity;\
      \ acceleration will be addressed later. In the same way we could plot spatially,\
      \ we could take the XYZ position of the center of mass and create a three-dimensional\
      \ representation. We can also make a plot where the X-axis represents position\
      \ and the Y-axis represents velocity. \n\nAt any moment, you could say, \"Okay,\
      \ your Z position is 12, and your velocity is three.\" This indicates your current\
      \ state at that moment in time. Then, we could look at the next time step and\
      \ say, \"Well, your position is going to go up because your velocity is positive,\
      \ but your velocity is also decreasing because you\u2019re in the air.\" You\
      \ can analyze each frame to identify the state, plot it, and connect the dots\
      \ based on time. \n\nSpatial intuition is something we are naturally good at.\
      \ We have an excellent understanding of ballistics and velocity; there is a\
      \ deep, intuitive understanding where most of us can gauge how to jog up stairs\
      \ or catch a ball. This is different from calculus; we are not all adept at\
      \ calculus because it has specific formalisms of symbols and rules. However,\
      \ we are good at understanding what calculus represents\u2014values that change\
      \ over time. \n\nI am always trying to present these concepts at an intuitive\
      \ level without getting bogged down in the numbers and the formalities. One\
      \ major issue with the educational system is that it often filters out people\
      \ based on their ability to understand concepts that are presented in difficult\
      \ ways, which creates the perception that math and calculus are hard. This mindset\
      \ stems from a societal failure to effectively educate on a large scale. \n\n\
      Like I mentioned in previous classes, if it makes sense to you that change in\
      \ position over time equals velocity, and that change in velocity over time\
      \ equals acceleration, then you do understand calculus! You may not be familiar\
      \ with the formalities required to impress your calculus professor, but that\
      \ core understanding is really all that matters. \n\nRoboticists often discuss\
      \ how we have significant military funding trying to build robots to perform\
      \ basic human tasks while young children are intuitively zipping around playgrounds.\
      \ This complexity of human movement is fascinating, and we often try to simplify\
      \ these intuitive behaviors. Nailing down the stability of movements and determining\
      \ factors like why one configuration is more likely to fall than another can\
      \ be challenging. This is a reminder of how complicated the world is, often\
      \ requiring simplification. \n\nAt any moment, there is a defined state. If\
      \ you can represent that state with a small number of values, for every moment\
      \ in time, you can plot these points and visualize where the system is at different\
      \ time intervals. You can continue to draw these representations as the analysis\
      \ progresses."

    text: "These trajectories in state space hypothetically represent the relationship\
      \ between these values. In particular, things can emerge from that when you\
      \ plot them, highlighting intuitions that could be hard to identify in other\
      \ formats. We know from our gut checks in physics and from discussing ballistic\
      \ movement that there is a relationship between position, height, and velocity;\
      \ specifically, Z height, Z position, and Z velocity are related. We can eyeball\
      \ it in a time series format, but what would it look like if we plotted position\
      \ on one axis and velocity on the other axis, especially during this type of\
      \ behavior? The answer, hypothetically, can be seen in this plot, which represents\
      \ the jump behavior. Here, velocity is on the x-axis, and Z position is on the\
      \ vertical axis. The pink dots represent the apex of the jump, while the maroon\
      \ dot indicates the bottom of the jump. The green dot denotes the liftoff phase.\n\
      \nYou can see that this is a state space representation because every dot on\
      \ this curve represents the state of the center of mass system at a particular\
      \ moment in time. However, it's not a spatial representation; there's nothing\
      \ in space here because the x-axis is velocity. While you can cheat a bit with\
      \ space, in this case, you cannot. There is something intuitive about this representation;\
      \ the repeated cycle we know exists is now visually represented here. We can\
      \ observe, for example, that the peaks align more closely than the liftoffs.\
      \ The liftoff is being defined by something in my nervous system, and various\
      \ complex factors are at play.\n\nIf we wanted to, we could convert this from\
      \ a state space to a proper phase space. The phase space would rotate around\
      \ a unit circle and involve angles like theta and phi. Alternatively, we could\
      \ keep adding more parameters to make things even wackier. This is a two-dimensional\
      \ state space, but there are obviously more parameters that we could include\
      \ to define its state. This system likely requires about 43 numbers to define\
      \ its state, as it\u2019s based on joint counts multiplied by three. However,\
      \ in this case, we have an obvious third number: acceleration. We believe that\
      \ Z position, Z velocity, and Z acceleration are all coupled in some way. Fortunately,\
      \ we have an additional spatial dimension to plot. This two-dimensional plot\
      \ can be transformed into a three-dimensional one, where the third axis will\
      \ represent acceleration.\n\nI believe this will show up here. I hope this becomes\
      \ clearer; I wish I could visualize this more effectively. Now, we\u2019re looking\
      \ at the three-dimensional state space representation of that repetitive jumping\
      \ behavior. I realize I could have set this up to plot in a larger format, but\
      \ that's fine. Personally, I find Jupyter notebooks somewhat bothersome, but\
      \ they are useful in certain cases. This three-dimensional state space plot\
      \ illustrates the center of mass kinetics over this repeated jumping pattern.\
      \ We could analyze aspects of this shape in ways similar to how we would analyze\
      \ three-dimensional spatial trajectories, examining factors that may or may\
      \ not relate to the actual behavior. \n\nFor this particular behavior, I think\
      \ the analysis tends to lessen in quality due to limitations in the data; the\
      \ experimental design left much to be desired. Despite these technical issues,\
      \ there's something beautiful about this representation. It provides an intuitive\
      \ sense of what was occurring in that behavior. You can see there\u2019s a repeated\
      \ cycle happening, and I want to investigate how that cycle relates to other\
      \ factors at play. What we just went over, throughout the full class time, was\
      \ a series of analyses based on the previous pipeline representing the data\
      \ in a format that captures that cyclical structure. If we desired, we could\
      \ look at this in other formats and continue from there.  \n\nBecause we were\
      \ meticulous in maintaining an epistemological chain from the base voltages\
      \ captured by the camera through each stage of the pipeline\u2014tracking the\
      \ person in the image and all the necessary geometry and computation\u2014we\
      \ can trust that there is a relationship between the camera image and the reality\
      \ of what transpired at that moment in time. Several weeks ago, when the organism\
      \ in question was behaving in space, we can believe that the shape and structure\
      \ of this representation also have grounding in the behavior captured then.\
      \ This type of state space representation may not come up frequently in your\
      \ daily lives unless you're involved in the more complex parts of science, but\
      \ you can observe similar methods for representing complex, high-dimensional\
      \ data or behaviors across various fields.\n\nYou see these techniques in robotics;\
      \ for example, consider a multi-joint arm with shoulder angle, elbow angle,\
      \ and wrist angle plotted onto a trajectory. Even when dealing with a high-dimensional\
      \ robotic element, these state spaces and phase spaces define robotic movements.\
      \ Many people today are excited about reinforcement learning, but oftentimes\
      \ robotic movements are defined within these state and phase spaces. Again,\
      \ there's nothing special about the number three other than being the number\
      \ of spatial dimensions we have. If we wanted to plot a 45-dimensional state\
      \ space, we could, even if we can\u2019t visualize all those dimensions simultaneously.\
      \ Robotics trajectories are often represented within these spaces. You also\
      \ observe this in neural data; for example, if you record from multiple neurons..."

    text: "The neurons in the visual cortex, while you're displaying something to\
      \ the monkey, you might want to know about the firing of each of those neurons\
      \ relative to each other. So, you could define a certain state space and say,\
      \ \"Okay, for neurons one to 100, on the scale from resting firing rate to maximum\
      \ firing rate, where is each neuron in that space?\" If you think about a simple\
      \ case where you only have three neurons, when you show a stimulus to the monkey,\
      \ you can look at how the different neurons' firing rates relate to each other.\
      \ You can examine the structures that emerge from these types of plots and try\
      \ to use that to interpret what's going on at the neural level. \n\nBefore we\
      \ move on, I'm going to drop some jargon terms real quick. If you're interested\
      \ in this stuff, a point section is a classic term. A point section is basically\
      \ if you take a slice through this sort of shape. The array section is where\
      \ all those points connect. If you take a slice here, then the shape of the\
      \ intersections with that plane would be the array section. You could also do\
      \ time locking; for example, you could adjust it to allow it to swing around,\
      \ or you could chop it down so that each of these green dots is slammed to zero\
      \ and then observe how the shape changes. Oftentimes, when you do that, if you\
      \ align the time base to some relevant feature, different things will emerge.\
      \ Sometimes things will clean up and condense, and you can look at things that\
      \ way.\n\nWhen we show up before class, the previous class often has all the\
      \ complex math on the board. That's differential equations\u2014this is what\
      \ this stuff starts to get into pretty quickly. But just to be clear, I can't\
      \ do any of that math; I got nothing on that. I can probably write code that\
      \ does similar things to that board math, but if you sat me down and said, \"\
      Calculate the integral of this, that, or the other,\u201D I would have nothing.\
      \ You all could probably, if any of you have taken a math class in the past\
      \ five years\u2014not five, since you\u2019re pretty young\u2014but if you've\
      \ taken a math class at this school, you could probably math me out of the water\
      \ on paper. I just never learned how to do that. My bachelor's degree is in\
      \ philosophy. However, you can back your way in with intuition, and you can\
      \ learn how to do it in code. The nice thing about math is that once you get\
      \ good enough at it, you don\u2019t have to do it anymore; you can write the\
      \ code that does it. I am now at the point where I write the math on paper to\
      \ help me write the code better, but I promise I wasn't doing that for the first\

- full_transcript: okay all right what hello everybody sorry for the slow start um
    trying to get some stuff downloaded I should have downloaded at home um yeah so
    standard check in so we are officially in week number six uh which is a Fine Place
    to be um so we&amp;#39;ve covered a lot of stuff uh I would say we&amp;#39;ve
    covered the majority of like the the I guess like the bi the hardcore biomechanics
    stuff like to I&amp;#39;ve almost said like the motor control stuff but I probably
    will get back to it um but we&amp;#39;re going to take a little bit of time this
    week uh talking about just like we&amp;#39;re g like today we&amp;#39;re going
    to go through some examples of papers like direct like published papers something
    that i&amp;#39; really like so of have some experience sort of going through a
    published article and sort of try to make sense of that um and then on Wednesday
    we&amp;#39;ll do kind of like the like a sort of a small group kind of assignment
    to help you all prepare for the sort of exam like assignment SL poster proposal
    too that we&amp;#39;ll be do probably they&amp;#39;ll both be kind of like connected
    to each other and be du at the end of that&amp;#39;s this week um right next week
    um so yeah that&amp;#39;s I got these wrong I&amp;#39;ll fix that later um the
    so basically the idea is like you know at this point I&amp;#39;ve talked about
    some of the kind of the topic area stuff usually in the riew and then we spend
    a good amount of time recording some data in class and kind of just like eyeballing
    it like looking through it and sort of trying to figure out what kind of stories
    could be told there we came in with some sort of basic hypotheses and things like
    that um and so uh what I want the kind of this sort of Next twoe Period to be
    which you know next Monday is a holiday so it&amp;#39;ll be next three classes
    is to prepare yall to kind of start thinking about your own chosen topic whatever
    that happens to have been um using the kind of like thought processes and mental
    Frameworks and stuff like that that I&amp;#39;ve been talking about in the context
    of human body human movement research uh based off of kinematic motion capture
    data um so what that&amp;#39;s going to look like is you know sort of figuring
    out what the topic area you&amp;#39;ve chosen is um you&amp;#39;ve already done
    that to some extent um but sort of just you know digging into that a little bit
    more and then starting to think about uh the methodologies that are used to pursue
    your your topic of interest um I know that sort of the way that we gathered that
    it was sort of a combination of talking about topics and also picking a paper
    and the paper part is the sort of technically the most relevant part to the poster
    proposal but I want to make sure that that&amp;#39;s couched in the context of
    like there&amp;#39;s a reason why I like this paper and this because I&amp;#39;m
    interested in this topic um so trying to trying to sort of flesh out like the
    methodologies involved in your area of research um the kind of like and like the
    empirical sort of grounding of it like in the sense of so what are the methodologies
    used what are the tools that are used to collect the relevant data for whatever
    the topic may be um and then how does that kind of map on to the kind of conversations
    we&amp;#39;ve been having around cameras and motion capture and sort of you know
    what is the what is the sort of the core empirical tool involved what does it
    measure what are the sort of what are the units that get derived from that and
    what are the you know what are the the the data types and structures that the
    um that the sort of scientific insights in your area of focus are sort of build
    on top of um and that will kind of culminate into a sort of like a follow-up proposal
    like proposal proposal number two which will be uh sort of like a fleshed out
    version of the original sort of of like here&amp;#39;s a paper I care about thing
    um so been thinking about like how what kind of mechanism I want to use for that
    sort of thing um and I think what it will wind up being is a a a a base level
    assignment that will live on canvas and in the GitHub repo uh that will involve
    you copy pasting some text uh from your own kind of like the profile thing that
    you have been generating and pasting that into a set of chats from the bot that
    will be sort of prompted in in the server um that will be sort of the idea will
    be like you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll go in there you you&amp;#39;ll start with
    whatever your last um whatever the the most relevant blob of text you have about
    what your interest are and what the paper is that you in the topic You&amp;#39;
    chosen take that into a chat space and then the bot in that space will be prompted
    to ask you about a certain sort of layer of the I&amp;#39;ve been talking about
    um and then at the end of that you&amp;#39;ll ask it for a summary possibly using
    a prompt that I&amp;#39;ll provide and then take that and put it into another
    chat and then have another sort of layer of conversation um and then the output
    of sort of those set of conversations will be something resembling the poster
    proposal to that will sort of be the fleshed out version of what you&amp;#39;re
    looking at um and the reason for the structure is like I thought about trying
    to make just like like one chat like we&amp;#39;ve been doing that sort of does
    all the stuff but that starts getting really difficult and that starts getting
    into the space that these types of AI sort of as implemented here just can&amp;#39;t
    really do like they&amp;#39;re not really like it&amp;#39;s like if you give it
    a set of instructions it&amp;#39;s not really good at like two-part instructions
    like do this and then do that like it&amp;#39;s just not set up for that you can
    set up the code on the back end to handle some of the stuff automatically but
    it&amp;#39;s much much easier to just like make two versions of the prompt and
    then just give you the intelligent humans instructions that say do this and then
    do that um and the idea will be kind of like you know you&amp;#39;ll be setting
    yourself up for the next conversation and that will also give you some sort of
    experience but like directed prompting and that kind of like aiish training thing
    um and like the the the conversations and prompts that I set up for you will be
    kind of built out of the lectures that I&amp;#39;ve been giving Which on the YouTube
    playlist which is linked in the server um so I&amp;#39;ll be like you know doing
    something I&amp;#39;ve been doing might may not be obvious to you like of uh pulling
    the transcripts from those lectures and kind of pulling out the main points and
    sort of using that to help drive the conversation um and so that&amp;#39;s why
    it will sort of I&amp;#39;m counting that sort of set of chats as like an exam
    like object where you will have a set of things to do um and if you don&amp;#39;t
    do those things you&amp;#39;ll get a bad gr and it will be somehow culminative
    and based off of stuff that has happened before which I think is like the legal
    definition of a test um and then that will kind of set you up for The Proposal
    Part which is another requirement of the structure of the classes to make sure
    that by this week um pushing it um you&amp;#39;re set up to actually hypothetically
    start working on the actual poster with the kind of fleshed out nature that that
    needs to be um so I will it&amp;#39;s the the lecture pulling stuff is the reason
    why I&amp;#39;m not ready to give you anything today but I have all that stuff
    it&amp;#39;s kind of like uploading like the videos they they take a long time
    to upload so I have to wait for the last one to get up there because I only put
    it up this morning um but I&amp;#39;ll have something kind of put together and
    started for that by next Wednesday um so that way we can sort of talk about it
    in class you can ask questions things like that um and then you know leading in
    that be sort of uh hypothetically Doe by the end of week seven which is next week
    and so now I&amp;#39;m going to give a little bit of time talking about the the
    posters themselves and sort of I&amp;#39;ll put some templates into the um into
    the server and I I&amp;#39;ll get those in the relevant place on campus soon um
    but before I do that before you look to closly uh there any questions so far any
    sort of like concerns stress levels things that if you knew you would feel more
    comfortable about your status here someone sent me an email asking about the poster
    like structure itself for that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re going to talk about
    today um yeah great okay okay so the poster itself these are just some examples
    that I found um from previous courses taught uh which is made more difficult because
    I don&amp;#39;t have PowerPoint on this computer um but that&amp;#39;s okay okay
    we that one um so this is a PowerPoint slide uh it is you know PowerPoint or Google
    Slides I think it&amp;#39;s the equivalent or keynote on Mac is the equivalent
    of that um I&amp;#39;m sure a lot of you has PowerPoint slides in it um but it&amp;#39;s
    long story short the nice thing about something like a PowerPoint is that is a
    vector-based art thing um meaning that these visuals are defined not by sort of
    pixels on an image like a lot like most images like if you zoom in on them they
    start you could start to see the pixels um uh Vector base Graphics are not like
    that they are because they&amp;#39;re defined mathematically like this curve here
    is not defined as a set of dots it&amp;#39;s defined as like a mathematical definition
    of how to draw this shape and everything on the PowerPoint page is that way so
    the advantage there is that you can zoom it up infinitely and you&amp;#39;ll never
    see the pixels because it is not based on pixels um the opposite of vector base
    is raster based um and that&amp;#39;s most images where if like you take a screenshot
    and zoom in it start you can only zoom in to the level of the resolution of the
    image um so most posters are made with a vector-based visualization method um
    PowerPoint is I would say like the entry level version of that PowerPoint are
    an equivalent of PowerPoint um and for the vast majority of you I would say almost
    all of you except for someone who has like a really specific interest in like
    design um I would just say use use PowerPoint use Google whatever it is use whatever
    just make basically a single page a single slide that has information about your
    poster there if you&amp;#39;re feeling fancy and want to do the prograde version
    of this um the professional version of a vector graphics editor is called Adobe
    Adobe Illustrator is like the main one um you all have free access to the Adobe
    Creative s Suite through your Northeastern email email um you don&amp;#39;t know
    how to do that just ask someone that&amp;#39;s not me um how to get access no
    yeah just yeah you just kind of you just download and log in right you just download
    Creative Cloud and just log in with your north eastern account no you have to
    uh you have to go to a a specific website and then go to and submit a request
    for a license okay well that&amp;#39;s too bad but it takes like a day or so a
    day or two yeah so if you&amp;#39;re into that you can do it um there&amp;#39;s
    also um inkscape is a free version of Adobe Illustrator um which I&amp;#39;ve
    used it I sort of in the way that these things tend to go like the free version
    has kind of been in development for a long time when I was in grad school it wasn&amp;#39;t
    very good and wouldn&amp;#39;t be what I would consider like like an like a viable
    alternative um but I&amp;#39;ve used it recently and it&amp;#39;s gotten pretty
    good I think for basic usage it might be helpful but it but realistically don&amp;#39;t
    expect it to sort of be at the same level as illustrator but also realistically
    if you&amp;#39;re new to that space you&amp;#39;re not going to be using the pro
    tool to the pro level so you can give it a shot um and whatever you choose I would
    say like the stuff that we&amp;#39;ll be doing to prepare like the content of
    the poster will be independent of the poster itself so if you want to try a fancy
    thing and then sort of be like I don&amp;#39;t want to do this um you can convert
    later uh okay so what should actually go on the poster itself um the basically
    a poster is like a distillation of a paper that&amp;#39;s kind of I think the
    best way to think about it at the level that we&amp;#39;re doing in this class
    um that&amp;#39;s not all that a poster has to be um it could be other things
    um but the default sort of purpose of a poster is to kind of give you a representation
    of a particular study typically that you typically i&amp;#39; say almost exclusively
    that you yourself are doing um so that you can take it to something like a conference
    and then put it up and then have then stand next to it and hope people come by
    and talk to you about it um I showed you some pictures of like scientific conference
    poster sessions you can just you know sort of uh that&amp;#39;s the that is the
    the structure that&amp;#39;s being sort of mimicked here um so and at the end
    of the semester that roughly speaking where they go uh the week of April 7th there
    will be a poster session for all the inquiries classes and you&amp;#39;ll be assigned
    one of the days and that will be your day to present um and you&amp;#39;ll present
    your poster along with half of the students in each other class and then if you&amp;#39;re
    not presenting then your assignment will be to go around and partake in the posters
    um including you know a certain number of posters from this class and a certain
    number of posters from the other classes so you can kind of like get the experience
    of what that sort of process looks like and feels like um yeah so yeah so like
    I said I said before and we&amp;#39;ll say again um there there&amp;#39;s kind
    of there&amp;#39;s the default version of the assignment and then there&amp;#39;s
    kind of the whatever else you want to do part of the assignment um so I&amp;#39;m
    mostly going to be talking about the default assignment which is just pick a paper
    and present that paper as if you were you know a person I don&amp;#39;t I don&amp;#39;t
    know if they like what the other class say in terms of like should be like role
    playing like a grass in the lab or should you I think that gets kind of weird
    just or you can just be like my paper they blah blah blah just talk about it in
    the third person um but yeah but you also have the option of like you know if
    you want to add more citations there if you want to talk about other things um
    I think if you want to use any of the data that we use in this class as part of
    your poster um we can sort of set that up basically like any of the data that
    you&amp;#39;ve seen before now before April 7th I&amp;#39;ll have I&amp;#39;ll
    make that into a place where you can like pull screenshots and sort of just like
    talk about it um if you wanted to have the experience of using like actual data
    that you&amp;#39;ve been a part of as part of your presentation that&amp;#39;s
    a viable option um yeah so in terms of yeah so in terms of like how do you put
    the poster together together how do you you know from a given paper or topic area
    how do you actually create a poster uh that&amp;#39;s where there is sort of like
    instructions about that um which I think might on this one there are some instructions
    from other classes that I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll pull up that are sort of more
    written setup but um the basic idea is that you&amp;#39;re not what you&amp;#39;re
    not supposed to do is put all the information in the poster all the information
    in the paper on the poster um you don&amp;#39;t want to have what we call affectionately
    um a wall of text poster we all know what it feels like to be confronted with
    a big wall of text it&amp;#39;s not fun um and it doesn&amp;#39;t really it&amp;#39;s
    not helpful to you as a as a person coming in um something that I think really
    needs to be driven home over and over and over again is that science the scientific
    process is primarily a process of communication if you&amp;#39;re sitting alone
    in your lab collecting data and running running numbers and stuff like that and
    you never actually show it to anybody else you&amp;#39;re not actually doing science
    you&amp;#39;re just kind of like you&amp;#39;re doing an investigation you&amp;#39;re
    playing around with data but the process of science is is a process of communication
    so when you&amp;#39;re present in this sort of interface of a poster or a paper
    um is the traditional method for communicating science to other people uh presenting
    a poster in a conference kind of you know I I say unofficially counts as a peer-
    review type of session but you can&amp;#39;t say this is a peer reviewed poster
    um but you are getting it reviewed by your peers um in the sense that you know
    people other people who know the area are going to look at what you&amp;#39;ve
    done and hypothetically have the option of saying oh hey you made a mistake here
    there or the other um which is a Cornerstone of how we do sort of science you
    know I&amp;#39;m sort of I&amp;#39;m talking about a system that I&amp;#39;m pretty
    uh jaded about so I&amp;#39;ll talk about it kind of in the idealized form um
    so so yeah so so when you are translating whatever poster you&amp;#39;re doing
    whatever topic you&amp;#39;re doing whatever project you&amp;#39;re doing into
    poster form it your job is to kind of do the distillation like it&amp;#39;s you&amp;#39;re
    the you&amp;#39;re the person hypothetically who understands the project better
    than anyone else like argue like if it&amp;#39;s your research project you probably
    understand the nitty-gritty of it better than anybody else in the world and the
    people that you&amp;#39;re going to be communicating with are only going to be
    talking to you for like a couple of minutes like you know 5 10 minutes at most
    you know not at most but um a very short amount of time like if you look at you
    know the picture of like sfn or something like that there&amp;#39;s thousands
    and thousands of posters and if you&amp;#39;re a person you&amp;#39;re not going
    to see all of them you&amp;#39;re going to go to a particular area but you&amp;#39;re
    not going to be spending hours and hours on each poster you&amp;#39;re going to
    be kind of coming up and saying hey what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s the deal here
    and your job as the presenter is to be able to give them the deal like tell them
    what was what the study was and what what happened at a level where if they just
    sat there quietly and listen to you then you could get sort of from start to finish
    let&amp;#39;s say within 3 to 5 minutes um and the person listening knows enough
    of what&amp;#39;s going on that they can walk away and say oh yeah that poster
    they did this thing they found this result they you know they will if you&amp;#39;ve
    done a good job they will walk away with a certain sort of gut level takeaway
    um that they can that they will then be able to explain what your study was about
    without having to know all the details itself um so there&amp;#39;s a certain
    strategy on what you put on a poster uh where you want to make sure that you are
    like the takeaways that that person walks away with should be the takeaways that
    you want them to walk away with like there&amp;#39;s a lot of things in a given
    research study um and you can present the same study in five different ways and
    sort of have the person walk away with five different hopefully not like in hopefully
    not like incon herent inconsistent beliefs but you know you can focus on you know
    one thing or another and you want to make sure that you&amp;#39;re packaging it
    in a way that will they will be able to understand that will stick and that they
    will be able to walk away and when they say hey that study over there was was
    about this person doing this thing and finding this result that they&amp;#39;re
    saying roughly speaking what you believe about that thing um now I said if that&amp;#39;s
    what would happen if the person just stands there politely and doesn&amp;#39;t
    say anything which sometimes is what happens and typically it&amp;#39;s not uh
    the um it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not necessarily an insult especially at conferences
    that people are tired and they want to get the the the gist but um in general
    in Academia and the Sciences if somebody starts criticizing your work a lot and
    then just starts pulling it to pieces and picking up the threads it&amp;#39;s
    that&amp;#39;s a compliment like they care enough about what you&amp;#39;re doing
    to think about it and ask questions and it could be really offputting to people
    especially students who are used to fatigue being like to give you a a rank order
    in your grade um but if I&amp;#39;m asking a lot of questions it&amp;#39;s because
    I want to know more and I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m using my time and my energy and
    my attention to do the thing that I was train to do as a scientist who is peer
    reviewing other other research which is to look for problems look for mistakes
    um not necessarily to like not necessarily like to Target the mistakes but just
    because I want to understand what&amp;#39;s going on and I want to make sure that
    it was done right because we&amp;#39;re trying to sort of create new knowledge
    here um so that&amp;#39;s where the second part of the strategy comes in where
    if you&amp;#39;re presenting the poster you&amp;#39;re never please do not just
    read it to the person that&amp;#39;s not fun for anybody um but you&amp;#39;re
    going to present it in a high level way and then so that when the person asks
    questions ideally you have the answer to that question right there W waiting so
    even though you might be just zipping through this and sort of like moving past
    this stuff because it&amp;#39;s your study there&amp;#39;s a certain like the
    first time you present something you might be surprised by the questions that
    you get but after the first couple of conversations you realize that 90% of the
    questions that you get are predictable in some way and so you should just have
    those questions sort of answerable from the data that&amp;#39;s on the paper so
    you know this type of stuff is a good example where I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to
    be talking about um oh yeah we did this study with this mouse Maze and there was
    the water was this deep and the thing was this big I don&amp;#39;t want to be
    describing the size of the whole of the of the apparatus but if the person asks
    how deep it was I should have an answer for it and actually they wouldn&amp;#39;t
    even have to ask that question they can just look at the picture and get that
    themselves um similarly with a lot of like the the method like often times that&amp;#39;s
    where you put like details that you know you wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily say
    you could say oh yeah we have this rat do this thing and this maze but the details
    are there so the person can just kind of skim them and kind of know the answer
    there um and yeah and I will say I think that the you know there should be some
    kind of a methods section uh which should have some visual representation of like
    what you actually did what the study actually was like you know this is a good
    example because it&amp;#39;s like I know by looking at this that you looked at
    mice in a water bucket with a camera you know you could just as easily have you
    know if you skip this type of thing oh yeah you have this with a camera and I
    know that there were three conditions and one of them was a sham meaning they
    didn&amp;#39;t give it do anything one is injured and one is whatever this condition
    is and so now I have a sense of like what it is that you actually did it&amp;#39;s
    really easy when you know something too well to skip the parts I call it skipping
    Step Zero it&amp;#39;s like the things the immediate questions that anybody coming
    into would ask are the first things that you forget to explain when you get into
    it so it&amp;#39;s like you know you can have this if you&amp;#39;re just showing
    the result blah blah blah blah blah I could be like halfway into my conversation
    but then my person asked wait are these mice are they rats are they fruit flies
    are are they on a treadmill are these celegans you know they start asking questions
    that make it clear it&amp;#39;s like oh they don&amp;#39;t even know like basic
    thing that I did which is stand in a room with m in a water bat um so the method
    section should always have something that just makes it clear what that is in
    my preference that will typically be figure one in whatever paper you&amp;#39;re
    looking at this isn&amp;#39;t always the case but I I think this is true for papers
    as well like figure one or something very close to figure one should be some kind
    of a picture that makes it clear what you&amp;#39;re actually doing and the results
    over here um should be some representation of the data that was recorded uh typically
    there&amp;#39;s going to be I guess yeah you want there to be some nice Harmony
    here um and this is also typically where you are it&amp;#39;s your job to kind
    of choose the most important data um for a lot of papers and certainly for a lot
    of studies you&amp;#39;re produce a lot of data um and a lot of visualizations
    showing various things related to the data that you recorded um like whatever
    paper you choose like it could have you know five six 10 or more um figures of
    data in it but your job is to understand what&amp;#39;s the main figure what&amp;#39;s
    the main result you know and if I if if I can only show one or two results from
    this paper what should those results be and those should be the results that back
    up the conclusions and then keep your directions if that&amp;#39;s appropriate
    um of the study itself so I you know introduction is typically it&amp;#39;s kind
    of like the you know here&amp;#39;s why we did this this is where you can have
    citations if you want them like we did this because it&amp;#39;s related to this
    other study that did this other thing we did this because there is this group
    of papers that sort of suggested this effect is true and so we did this study
    to test if that effect is true um breaking it out into research question hypothesis
    is fine not everything has this stuff so delineate if it&amp;#39;s fine uh some
    kind of method saying here&amp;#39;s what we did some kind of a data data representation
    of like here&amp;#39;s the main results and some kind of a conclusion because
    of all the stuff that we did we believe that some fact of the world is the case
    um some new proposed fact of the world is the case like I this this is ifate the
    part where you say the things that you now believe because of the research that
    you did and you hope that after going through this little journey people that
    you&amp;#39;re talking to the people who are reading the paper um will also believe
    you they&amp;#39;ll say yeah the things that you&amp;#39;re describing seem supported
    they seem reasonable I will go along with you on this you know and then if enough
    people are convinced by the story that you&amp;#39;ve told it becomes a quote
    unquote scientific fact which is always something to be wary of because we&amp;#39;re
    always wrong about everything and and every scientific fact will be proven wrong
    in the fullness of time um so but we do our best in the moment um one so the so
    generally speaking uh by generally speaking I&amp;#39;ll say you will pretty much
    never read a poster to a person like if it&amp;#39;s your poster don&amp;#39;t
    read it to the person have some other way of talking about it but the idea is
    that if the person had the poster given to them and they read it from start to
    finish they would know roughly speaking the story that you&amp;#39;re trying to
    tell um and so in the poster itself for the actual presentation is kind of there
    as like an it&amp;#39;s sort of an aid for you um explaining what you&amp;#39;re
    doing so you have so you you don&amp;#39;t you can remember what they&amp;#39;re
    talking about you have things you can point to you have data you can point to
    um but yeah sort of a yeah it&amp;#39;s kind of the process there I should also
    say this is another sort of classic uh way of presenting data where these a points
    up here are what you would call Representative data and then this here is some
    measure of the like the statistics of that data so representative data is basically
    like you can choose like you the researcher because you are a trustworthy person
    who&amp;#39;s not lying and has ear methods appropriately documented you are allowed
    to look at the big body of data that you have and pick a particular recording
    that is representative of the of what you&amp;#39;re trying to show um so you
    might record um so yeah so in this case they put mice in a water bucket and then
    they had to learn where platform was so they can sort of get out of the water
    um and our case we were doing stuff like you know the jumping task or you know
    the standing task and so for the standing so imagine for the standing task we
    recorded 25 different uh participants and you know and each of them did 10 different
    repetitions of beta that&amp;#39;s that 200 some of Trials whatever um you can
    go in and kind of pick one trial or even one section of one trial that exemplifies
    the effect that you&amp;#39;re trying to show um and then just click about that
    one little part sort of clean up and then past it there and say this is representing
    a data from a subject in the partip stud um but that&amp;#39;s not really that&amp;#39;s
    an without additional support that is anecdotal that is you just sort of picking
    one from a set of a thousand options and saying this is the one that looks like
    the story that I&amp;#39;m trying to tell that&amp;#39;s not that that&amp;#39;s
    not really evidence on itself so you want to have you want to be able to back
    that up by having some kind of a measure of Statistics that is looking at all
    1,000 trials that you did and sort of appropriately comparing you know subjects
    to subjects and conditions to conditions and da da da um so that this is where
    you actually start having statistical power and statistically supported statements
    and this is these are the data that kind of like this is where like the real grounding
    and sort of knowledge generation comes from um but it&amp;#39;s good to kind of
    pair both because you know the representative subject data helps the kind of understand
    what you&amp;#39;re talking about um or the statistical data helps them understand
    that this is a thing that happens in general um that&amp;#39;s always going to
    be different based on the studies and stuff that you&amp;#39;re that you&amp;#39;re
    doing um you want to see posters um generally if you just walk around a department
    in the school you&amp;#39;ll see posters on the wall um people put their favorite
    posters on the walls outside their lab uh and so you can just walk around and
    take a look at what they would look like and sort of just get a sense of the sort
    of the styles that are available and sort of the choices that are made and you&amp;#39;ll
    see some with a ton of words on them you&amp;#39;ll see some with very few words
    on them um and I recommend just doing that just go whatever hours the day you
    want through whatever you know wherever the various Departments of the school
    are and you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll typically find posters on the wall that
    you can sort of look at um in our case the sizes can be very different I&amp;#39;ve
    gone to conferences where the posters are like 6ot by 4ot so very very large I&amp;#39;ve
    gone to some conferences where they&amp;#39;re like 3T X 3T which is very small
    um I can&amp;#39;t actually remember I I want to say that our posters are 24 by
    36 Ines um which is like this big but I can&amp;#39;t recall I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll
    look that up that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a relevant thing to have but mostly
    that will just affect the font size that you use um this is again with the vector
    scale stuff like the actual scale shouldn&amp;#39;t matter too much um yeah so
    but it does depend like you know you want to make sure that the font size is not
    oppressive [Music] um yeah also just Google scientific poster you&amp;#39;ll find
    a lot of examples uh is the kind of thing that there will be many many layers
    of explication and tutorials about how to make a good this and how to do a good
    that and that will all be relevant here um with the exception that you won&amp;#39;t
    be writing paper yourself a lot of this stuff is just going to be sort of copy
    pasting from the paper itself just you know get the figure put it up and um then
    these sort of the section down here in the bottom right will be where you put
    your citations that will be generated from Soo or whatever else uh yeah yeah so
    we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll go through this and then on a particular day of yeah
    so yeah so the the poster needs to be uploaded by Tuesday March 25th uh which
    means that you&amp;#39;ll upload a PDF and then it&amp;#39;ll get printed um they
    charge you for it I want to say like 20 something bucks I can&amp;#39;t remember
    exactly I&amp;#39;ll get that number too um but that&amp;#39;s due at the end
    where 25th is oh that&amp;#39;s due on the Monday so two weeks before the actual
    poster session which is mostly um because as you can imagine the the printer office
    gets for this course hundreds I guess of posters so we want to make sure to give
    them enough lead time that they can get it all pretty in case anything goes wrong
    um and there&amp;#39;ll be instructions on how to do that and you know all that
    good stuff yeah and this I will um so I&amp;#39;m going to drop these into the
    Discord server before I put them on canvas just so it&amp;#39;s available I please
    load up any questions or confusions s okay yeah so like I just do my poster on
    one paper I just do that on paper is there any otheres not really no um like by
    the the base level assignment that so so they had a couple yeah um that was S
    I say again was that they only reference it in int I&amp;#39;m actually I was
    looking for that uh cuz I actually can&amp;#39;t see see where these citations
    actually happen in the poster uh I guess this that might be something I can&amp;#39;t
    remember so I would actually say they may have this may have just been like incorrectly
    done because you&amp;#39;re supposed to site stuff here but this again for this
    assignment it&amp;#39;s a little bit weird um so I&amp;#39;d say like the default
    assumption is that there&amp;#39;s you know the base level assignment is that
    there&amp;#39;s only going to be one citation here and it&amp;#39;s the citation
    of the actual p paper um where you got the things um I would still say you should
    site it somewhere in the like in either in the introduction or in the conclusions
    and say you know this and that study did this you know you this one either have
    the one or CH at all 2018 just had that cited somewhere in the text um and yeah
    so in default assumption is that&amp;#39;s just the one paper uh it&amp;#39;s
    also the kind of case I think as you go into your paper there might be some other
    obvious choices to site like you know you know future directions could you like
    oh there are some follow-up studies that were done after this was post to be cited
    there um in in their introduction they might say we&amp;#39;re doing this because
    of this other paper and then you can just site that one too um if you wind up
    you know they&amp;#39;re using some weird method that you don&amp;#39;t understand
    and then you go find the review article that says here&amp;#39;s how that method
    works and how it&amp;#39;s used if you use that as part of your development of
    the poster that&amp;#39;s a good thing that you would want to just have some citations
    somewhere and then just put it down there um you know citations in this context
    are often used as kind of like you know it&amp;#39;s a rubric it&amp;#39;s like
    it&amp;#39;s like oh you have to have this many in order for it to be a valid
    thing um but that&amp;#39;s obviously nonsense that&amp;#39;s not how we use it
    in in the real world when you&amp;#39;re you just you site stuff that you have
    used to say to understand all the work in this poster that I&amp;#39;m presenting
    and this research that I&amp;#39;m presenting you have to also go back and sort
    of like I am doing I I am building this study and this knowledge on the basis
    of the stuff that I have you know read before like I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m building
    this on other people&amp;#39;s work and if I&amp;#39;m doing that I need to cite
    it because you know for if you&amp;#39;re trying to figure out if you should trust
    this resource that I&amp;#39;m presenting you I need to tell you that the stuff
    I&amp;#39;m presenting depends on work that has come before me and this is that
    work so hypothetically if you really really didn&amp;#39;t trust somebody when
    they&amp;#39;re presenting their data to you you can go back and look at all the
    things that they&amp;#39;re depending on and this is where you get into this Con
    there&amp;#39;s like a concept of like citation networks and stuff like that where
    you know any study that has a certain am number of citations you can Bounce from
    that study to other studies and sort of navigate all the empirical work that has
    been done in the world for you know at least since whatever 1800s when sure of
    keeping track of this stuff um so so yeah so but for the for the strict assignment
    it&amp;#39;s just one thing and in general when it comes to posters the citation
    thing is a little it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s much squishier like like
    posters are generally speaking kind of an informal type of presentation um not
    always some conferences are are pretty serious about them but I think for the
    convers that are serious about their poster sessions the posters are always paired
    with a paper so you write a six-page paper or whatever Accord that to go along
    with a poster and the poster itself is you sort of often just sort of like you
    print it for the conference and then you just use it to discuss at the conference
    and then it&amp;#39;s not going to go into some like you know the anals of some
    scientific Society or something like that so they&amp;#39;re generally just sort
    of treat it as a much more informal type of thing and then the actual like the
    actual proper like review process is done at the level of Articles and papers
    make sense yeah anything else any other questions thoughts feelings cool all right
    yeah yeah we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll be sure to plan some time somewhere
    probably somewhere in this sort of two week chunk oh yeah do at the beginning
    of this week so I&amp;#39;ll plan there&amp;#39;ll be something in this chunk
    to kind of like practice your poster now I&amp;#39;ll try to do it the week before
    it goes because it&amp;#39;s often like you put you put the poster together and
    then you start explaining you&amp;#39;re like oh this is not at all what I want
    so I will do some sort of we can do some kind of demo run probably in this week
    um so that you&amp;#39;ll have a you have a chance to kind of go through it with
    your peers before you&amp;#39;re doing it in person um it is also just absolutely
    standard experience that when you&amp;#39;re presenting a poster for the first
    time the first couple people that you present it to get the worst version of the
    story and generally speaking speaking by the end of the session which you know
    for a lot of conferences can be like you know 3 4 hours rather long time um you
    have by by the end of that poster session you have the story of your research
    so down like so perfectly down that it&amp;#39;s like if you ever find yourself
    going to a conference and presenting a poster I beg of you to do yourself the
    favor of taking notes voice notes text notes whatever you can about what you&amp;#39;ve
    been talking about in your poster like the moment the poster session is done because
    the story that you&amp;#39;re trying to tell will never be clearer in your mind
    than it will be after you have pulled it you know however many dozens of times
    you do um and that&amp;#39;s another like within the context of like how science
    operates and sort of a practical communal sense that is often the purpose of a
    poster session um not always the case but generally the case posters and also
    talks like most of the times when you&amp;#39;re when you&amp;#39;re presenting
    stuff at a conference it&amp;#39;s stuff that you&amp;#39;re working on it&amp;#39;s
    not stuff that&amp;#39;s you you typically I mean it sort of depends on the cycle
    but you I think if if you&amp;#39;re really using the conference to its fullest
    extent you should be presenting stuff that&amp;#39;s not quite done yet it&amp;#39;s
    not ready for prime time it&amp;#39;s not published it&amp;#39;s not peer-reviewed
    it&amp;#39;s the paper that you&amp;#39;re currently writing not the one that
    you just published um because this poster session the poster session in particular
    is a really great opportunity to like hone the story that you&amp;#39;re telling
    um and when you know and ask questions someone you know say oh yeah we use this
    method I&amp;#39;m kind of I&amp;#39;m new to this and someone&amp;#39;s going
    to come by and like oh I actually know that method quite well and then you can
    ask them that question when it comes up um you know you might have a certain way
    of saying it that like the first couple times you do it people don&amp;#39;t really
    get it and then you figure out some turn of phrase that makes everyone go oh right
    now I see what&amp;#39;s going on and that&amp;#39;s the way that you want to
    describe it like you know when you&amp;#39;re describing the methods like you
    know you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll often this is this is absolutely the most classic
    student behavior that ever exists you&amp;#39;ll describe it in way too much detail
    um and then eventually you&amp;#39;ll learn all the details that you can leave
    out that help people understand what it is with with the minimum amount of time
    and then that&amp;#39;s the way you should learn how to talk about the stuff that
    you&amp;#39;re doing they&amp;#39;re very classic especially for grass students
    like The Birth down grass students start presenting uh research they will um they
    will spend the amount the amount of time they spend discussing a particular area
    is proportional to the amount of time that they spent working on that area and
    that&amp;#39;s almost never what you should do like it&amp;#39;s possible that
    whoever these people are spent a good four to five months trying to figure out
    how to make the water in the stupid thing stopped leaking out and they kept using
    there some thing that wasn&amp;#39;t working and they figured out the glue and
    then blah blah blah blah blah and like that&amp;#39;s and then when they actually
    got it working the data just kind of fell out of it and so when they give the
    presentation they&amp;#39;re going to spend the first half of the conversation
    talking about all the glue that they had to use and how the the leak you know
    how they sort of got the the water up to the right level and da da da da da that
    stuff shouldn&amp;#39;t even be a part of the conversation you just that part
    off sometimes when I&amp;#39;m giving a presentation I&amp;#39;ll just say in
    this slide transition was 6 months of my life and then I just show the result
    where it worked and not the 15 iterations of failed attempts that I had to do
    before I got the version that works um if the things that you were doing to make
    it work are interesting you might want to record them in another place but a poster
    is almost never that time um and then that might be the case where someone comes
    along go how&amp;#39;d you get your stupid thing to fill up because ours keeps
    leaking that&amp;#39;s when you can say oh yeah we use this glue and not the other
    glue and that&amp;#39;s the place where like at the end of the paper that you
    wind up publishing on it you can have the very long methods where you can have
    a little section about why you have to use this glue and not the other glue and
    da da da da um yeah so it&amp;#39;s the process of kind of distillation that I
    think is really the nut of this assignment um and it is your job as the sort of
    the ambassador of This research study to to to make the call to make the Judgment
    call about what what&amp;#39;s the most important part and what&amp;#39;s the
    narrative that we&amp;#39;re going to try to pursue here okay yeah right we good
    cool um yeah and we will have plenty more opportunity to talk about this stuff
    in your specific case but um cool all right now with all of that said let us just
    let&amp;#39;s go and look at at a paper and let&amp;#39;s see so we have approximately
    40 minutes left and I am going to attempt to do to look at two separate papers
    which is a terrible idea because I&amp;#39;ve already done the thing of saying
    this is going to have an and in the lecture um and I love the papers I&amp;#39;m
    talking about and I&amp;#39;m going to want to dive deeply into them um but I
    think it&amp;#39;s fun to do the the quick run through so we&amp;#39;ll do that
    and I&amp;#39;ll try to keep myself to a particular time um I will also finish
    up a thought I meant to have like half an hour ago wishes uh after we do this
    sort of aside around the the papers and the assignment and the exam like object
    um we&amp;#39;re going to transition into Vision stuff um like eyeballs and I&amp;#39;ll
    bring in an eye tracker and we sort of like talk more about visual Neuroscience
    I record semit tracking data of like go through it to the similar to how we did
    before um it&amp;#39;s going to be a bit of a different vibe there just because
    the nature of the equipment and the data but um we&amp;#39;re going to do Vision
    stuff um which yeah is always fun uh yeah vision and specifically eye movements
    um which are technically a part of motor control because it involves muscles but
    sort of a interesting space there okay so in 20 minutes or less which will put
    us at 410 uh I&amp;#39;m going to look up so C prot cpg is one of those things
    I forgot for that m um storing volary there we go 2012 this used to be a new study
    now it&amp;#39;s old that&amp;#39;s not that old it&amp;#39;s just over a decade
    at this point so I just for so this is a paper published in science which is one
    of the bigger journals out there there sort of there&amp;#39;s two journals which
    are sort of like categorically the biggest journals biggest and most prestigious
    science and nature um that sort of cultural reality of there being a biggest thing
    is generally toxic and leads to a lot of bad outcomes but nonetheless uh if you
    see something published in science or nature that&amp;#39;s a good study good
    and prestigious study um generally speaking the more generic the name of the journal
    is the more prestigious it is so the Portuguese study of ankle Prosthetics research
    is generally going to be lower Prestige than you know Journal of Prosthetics which
    is going to be lower prestige in Journal of biology which is going to which so
    science and nature are about as big as you can get in that space Also cell is
    a very good one for biology [Music] um and because we are on campus I could just
    download this here um but just for fun we&amp;#39;re going to go to scub uh and
    punch it in there and add that way uh I&amp;#39;m using this dark reader thing
    so turn that off so it looks like it would normally look okay and I have 15 some
    OD minutes to go through this I probably won get to a second we&amp;#39;ll see
    okay so this is kind of normal um the when you download the PDF the front page
    is just kind of like info about the thing um title arti artist author list Journal
    at all means there&amp;#39;s more of them um and there&amp;#39;s links here to
    things like supporting material supporting online material other things that site
    this article sites um with modern papers typically there&amp;#39;s going to be
    supplemental data or supplemental data supplemental methods and stuff like that
    um modern contemporary Journal articles are tend to have very very constrained
    lengths um so the core studies are typically going to be quite short um unless
    it&amp;#39;s like a Journal Review or like an older you know that all varies very
    much by um by Journal um so to kind of get around that they&amp;#39;ll often have
    these like supplemental stuff so like either something like the methods will not
    be a part of the word count and or um you have the opportunity to present additional
    data there um and yeah so so what I&amp;#39;m going to do now with this study
    because I know this study quite well uh I&amp;#39;m going to try to give you something
    like a very high level overview of this paper that ideally will both be fast enough
    that I can do it in the next 15 minutes um comprehensible enough that you&amp;#39;ll
    be able to follow the story despite not being sort of particularly trained in
    this area um and ideally a sort of fair and honest representation of what was
    actually being done so that if you were to take the time so sort of read this
    paper in depth and sort of get through all the nitty-gritty you would come out
    of it saying oh yeah everything that John said about this is an accurate representation
    like I&amp;#39;m creating the cartoon Narrative of the study so that I can present
    it to you in a way that will sort of handle itself and if you became an expert
    on this area and on this paper ideally you would be able to evaluate my choices
    of cartoon ification and understand why I choosing this form of the cartoon and
    not some other form of the cartoon this so so yeah so this is a study about the
    spinal cord and particular it&amp;#39;s looking at spinal cord injury and trying
    to get at something like a what has been a sort of Holy Grail type of thing for
    quite some time which is the ability to heal spinal cord injuries like you you
    know you get an injur you get an accident your spinal cord is damaged and you
    lose control of your limbs below that area may you might lose control of your
    legs you might lose control of your whole body depending on where that injury
    occurs and we really really would like it if we could correct that in some way
    um which yeah the same way that we can correct it when you break your ankle or
    you know damage some muscle damage some skin we would love to be able to correct
    that on a person um yeah so this here is the abstract of the paper um again different
    journals will sort of format this in different ways this one&amp;#39;s not even
    labeling it as the abstract they kind of assume that you know that um but sometimes
    it might be called a summary sometimes it might be called something else um I
    know noticed that on yeah so on the actual website they&amp;#39;re giving a sort
    of a high level summary in addition to the abstract um but yeah all the information
    should rly speaking be there um so this study Builds on so this study so the the
    application is for uh is in the space of trying to sort of heal spinal cord injury
    um but this study is not looking at patient populations they&amp;#39;re not looking
    at people who have spinal cord injuries um they are looking specifically at rats
    um and this is where like if you look at any so these numbers here are the citations
    and if you scroll to the the end of the paper uh they will correspond to the actual
    citations there um these are in science format um sometimes you&amp;#39;ll see
    citations where it&amp;#39;s like author year so it&amp;#39;s like you know Mathis
    edel 2019 or something like that that&amp;#39;s APA format this is a more engineering
    style literally just because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s made to be shorter um and
    see if you look at these citations they will be referencing clinical studies and
    medical studies and things like that um but they are not themselves doing research
    on humans this is a this is an application with a basic science sort of motivation
    where they&amp;#39;re trying to have a theoretical they&amp;#39;re trying to increase
    theoretical understanding but they&amp;#39;re doing it in service of being able
    to move towards this applied goal um and they are building on a history of studies
    of um studying Central pattern gener spinal Central pattern generators in mammals
    um those Central pattern generators exist in pretty much all animals not not necessarily
    all animals but many many animals um and they they generally refer to neural architectures
    that generate rhythmic Activation so it&amp;#39;s some sort of like a metronome
    type of activ of activity uh which is the basis of a lot of motor behavior and
    just um General life so let&amp;#39;s see so so this is a really fun animation
    of a ant walking alternating tripod gate so the red or one tripod blue or another
    tripod that&amp;#39;s how insects operate and that&amp;#39;s a rhythmic Behavior
    breathing is a rhythmic Behavior most forms of locomotion ayic Behavior flapping
    is a rhythmic Behavior it&amp;#39;s the kind of thing that is present down to
    invertebrates like insects and also present up to mammals like us and um spinal
    cpg cat uh and this particular study is following a particular sort of branch
    of um of ways of studying that idea of central pendon where specifically as they
    exist in the spines of invertebrates um because it&amp;#39;s kind of this like
    there&amp;#39;s a general question around like we know that cpgs are present in
    lower animals we can study them very carefully in those animals um because they&amp;#39;re
    simpler and you know we can sort of open them up and sort of see these things
    happening um but then the question kind of arises like what is the role of these
    types of neural architectures in more complex animals like mammals who have many
    many many more neurons and have many many many or mag more complex behaviors um
    but still have the same sort of evolutionary history um so this is a a a video
    which is quite old and kind of from an era sort of a different era of like animal
    rights I&amp;#39;ll say um so this shows a cat that has been uh decerebrated um
    so it&amp;#39;s hard to see but this is this is the cat and it&amp;#39;s being
    supported by these liars and this cat has had its spine SED here so from so let&amp;#39;s
    see how you drop so that&amp;#39;s the brain and then that&amp;#39;s the cerebellum
    and that&amp;#39;s their spine and then these are the legs and I think for this
    era they would sever the spine there so they they surgically cut the spinal cord
    so that there is no information going from the legs to the brain and no information
    going from the brain to the legs um and so the legs are still connected to the
    spinal cord here um and then kind of the interesting result here is that if the
    cat is supported and walking on a treadmill the hind limbs are still walking they&amp;#39;re
    still doing the rhythmic behavior of locomotion being driven by the sensory motor
    Loops from the feet up through the spine and sort of back so this is kind of counter
    to a lot of our intuitions about how the Spine Works um which we tend to think
    of it as like a there yeah um you have to think of this just kind of like extension
    cables that sort of lead from like the brain down to the dumb muscles um but this
    type of stuff shows that there is processing happening in there like your spinal
    cord is a part of your central nervous system and it can handle simple stuff like
    the sensory information coming off of the feet um is enough to generate the behavior
    that leavs the feet to sort of like if I&amp;#39;m being pushed backwards at a
    certain point I should lift up go forward and come down again and the two limbs
    are sort of reciprocally activated by Central pattern generators in the spine
    and so that not only can the cat walk um despite having no cerebral implant to
    their spine to the back legs as the as the treadmill speeds up they speed up with
    it um which is just sort of chew on that you seem perturbed it just feels wrong
    yeah yeah yeah yeah uh it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a wild result just
    to be clear and it absolutely is baffling in many layers and levels um but and
    probably is when I like to study so much um and it&amp;#39;s kind of like you
    know as is often the case um it&amp;#39;s those parts of the empirical investigation
    where you go oh wait that&amp;#39;s not what I was expecting we&amp;#39;re often
    the best investigations live um because despite how strange that is uh I&amp;#39;m
    giving up on the second paper we&amp;#39;re going to focus on this one um for
    the rest of the class uh we&amp;#39;ll talk about the next one the next one about
    dragon flies we&amp;#39;ll talk about that once we&amp;#39;ve done more Vision
    stuff about vision and dragon flies we&amp;#39;ll get there um so so yeah so the
    um so despite that being a sort of strange and baffling study um um it has it&amp;#39;s
    also venerable like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s been around for a while we&amp;#39;ve
    known about this for a while that there are these Central pattern generators that
    govern movement and they handle like things like the basic trade-offs between
    you know the limbs going from stance to swing and stuff like that um and so there&amp;#39;s
    been active areas of research since then trying to understand the nature of these
    spinal cpgs and trying to understand like you know where they how they operate
    and sort of what the connection is between the brain and the and the like the
    upper level of the brain and the lower level of the spine and sort of into the
    peripheral nerves and stuff like that um and those Studies have evolved uh there
    was some point in time I&amp;#39;m not really sure the exact history here uh where
    you know the animal rights rules kind of evolved uh and at some point they were
    like don&amp;#39;t use cats for that anymore um the rules about animal ethics
    are interesting and complicated I&amp;#39;ll talk about them at some point um
    but there are kind of like rules about like which animal you&amp;#39;re allowed
    to use for which study and there are some kind of like strange designations for
    like higher higher level versus lower level and typically speaking the closer
    you get to a humanlike animal the the the more stringent the standards are so
    like we do still use non human primates for Neuroscience research we don&amp;#39;t
    use apes and chimpanzees um but if you want to do monkey research you have to
    really really justify that you that you&amp;#39;re doing research that needs to
    be done that it needs to be done on a non-human primate um and so at some point
    they you know they decided that you can&amp;#39;t do it on cats anymore so now
    they do similar stuff with rats so this study was done with rats um and this also
    by the way has a really fun Ted talk about it um where Greg Lut is very very like
    smarmy French type of thing which is is a really good presentation um if you can
    get past the kind of like the Ted Talk of it all um but it&amp;#39;s a good job
    of like telling an interesting story um although yeah the way he tells his story
    is actually not the way I tell my story because that&amp;#39;s another sort of
    point to to call out here I am telling you this story as I have internalized it
    like I me as a particular individual human scientist with a particular background
    and sort of like area of the world that I&amp;#39;m trying to make sense of when
    I tell you the story about this paper it&amp;#39;s going to be different than
    if the the authors of the study told you this paper or if somebody with a different
    background and interest set were tell you the story of this paper um there&amp;#39;s
    this sort of context of like narrative that keeps coming up um that feels sort
    of like unexpected in a sort of discussion of like scientific empirical studies
    but remember this is all stuff being done by humans and we only remember stories
    that make sense to us um and so I&amp;#39;m going to tell the story I&amp;#39;m
    going to tell you sort of highlights a particular area of this that I think is
    sort of I found motivating um since I gave myself a little bit more time also
    talk a little bit more structurally about this paper uh so these are all authors
    of the paper they all contributed in some way um the the person at the front is
    the first author typically speaking this is like the owner of this the person
    who like did the work and sort of own the project generally speaking um this is
    going to be like a grad student or a post do or something like that the last author
    is the often times the senior author um so generally speaking not always the case
    um and this does this is somewhat Fu dependent but in most like biology related
    neuroscience types of of of studies the last author is the person who runs the
    lab where the study was done and the first author is the person in the lab that
    generally did that work um again it&amp;#39;s very it&amp;#39;s very that&amp;#39;s
    all very very it varies dramatically by paper and by field and by whatnot um but
    if you&amp;#39;re like in grad school or a postd something like that like you
    they you will be considering your first author Publications differently from your
    non-ir author Publications the people in the middle are people typically people
    that like helped out in some way um but they were not like the owner of the study
    um yeah then once you get to not once you start publishing papers and start looking
    doing things that involve paper publishing um people will ask you questions about
    how many first author Publications do you have versus second author Publications
    typically you&amp;#39;ll have more second author pubs than first author pubs and
    then once you get to the point where you actually are running lab people will
    start asking questions about how many last author Publications you have meaning
    are you training people to do this work appropriately um again that&amp;#39;s
    very field dependent um math people when they publish math papers they publish
    their authors alphabetically which is wild to me um but what I&amp;#39;m describing
    here is like sort of like standard cultural practice in contemporary scientific
    publishing um down here you got all these little citations showing what these
    numbers correspond to so like where they&amp;#39;re working most of the work with
    done in Switzerland U and it&amp;#39;s also going to tag um oh here&amp;#39;s
    a tag that says okay so these two have a star that says these authors contributed
    equally to this work which is something it&amp;#39;s a way that people try to
    get around the the first authoress of it but I guarantee you there was a discussion
    about despite them being starred who actually gets to be first and then this one
    is also important uh this is the corresponding author so this little symbol here
    says that if you want to ask a question about this paper you should contact this
    guy so that&amp;#39;s typically going to be in there um and also I will go to
    the end just because again from a structural perspective um there&amp;#39;s always
    going to be something like an acknowledgement somewhere in the paper and they&amp;#39;re
    going to they&amp;#39;ll do like thanks you know thank you for this person for
    helping with the robotic interface and da da d da um but they will also generally
    not not generally always should um site their funding sources so where did the
    money come from like in in this case they&amp;#39;re listing a bunch of Grants
    from uh European research councils and d d this is an expensive St there a bunch
    of Grants but it&amp;#39;s sort of a you know there&amp;#39;s always going to
    be something saying thanks to the NIH for giving me this grant or whatever um
    and typically uh this is another place where like you say hey thanks for giving
    me this Grant and you tell you say this is this is you know Grant number is this
    so you can for public grants which most of these are you can go on you can go
    look up the grant that was written to fund This research and sort of see what
    they were talking about there so it&amp;#39;s just kind of another way that people
    kind of keep connected to the larger uh Community when they&amp;#39;re publishing
    particular papers um yeah modern papers also tend to talk they have a like a of
    like very like more recent than 2012 you&amp;#39;ll it&amp;#39;s more common to
    see uh sections that say that list out what each author did so like this person
    helped collect the data this person wrote the thing and there&amp;#39;ll be a
    a paragraph or two saying what each author actually did when they were like how
    do they earn their spot on the on the author list okay so this particular study
    um this is your figure one figure one this style of figure is very common in like
    science and nature um journals because science and nature journals are very very
    short and very very dense this is also specifically um a report um which is you
    know generally speaking the journal will have like oh we have articles which are
    full length and like report which is short length and you know brief communication
    which is some other length and it&amp;#39;s just so this is a report which is
    like this the T it&amp;#39;s not the longest format it&amp;#39;s the second it&amp;#39;s
    like a a shorter form and this whole this whole study is five pages including
    uh the this front page so it&amp;#39;s only four written pages of text and then
    probably if you go to those supplemental documents it&amp;#39;s going to be when
    you go to the supplemental stuff it&amp;#39;s typically going to look like a Microsoft
    Word document converted to PDF and it&amp;#39;s going to be dozens to possibly
    more um Pages um but this study yeah so this picture with very dense with like
    letter um sort of sub panels um in particular with this kind of like professional
    looking animation sort of or visualization here very indicative of this type of
    Journal um if you go to sort of more like standard bread and butter types of journals
    like anything that&amp;#39;s like Journal of like biomechanics Journal of blank
    um the the the the figures will generally look more like a real regular human
    made them rather than like a professional Graphics design team which in this case
    is what happens um so yeah and then um when I&amp;#39;m looking at a new paper
    uh I will look at the title I&amp;#39;ll look at roughly speaking who wrote it
    like not the PE see if I recognize any names and kind of just look at where they&amp;#39;re
    working um I&amp;#39;ll read the abstract um and then I&amp;#39;ll kind of skim
    the paper and look you know start out by just looking at the figures I typically
    like and by typically I will pretty much never just like sit down with a new paper
    and just read it from start to finish like it&amp;#39;s a novel like that&amp;#39;s
    just not how we tend to interrogate scientific papers usually it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s
    kind of like jpeg compression like you do a you do skims at different levels and
    you kind of because you want to have the full picture and then you can sort of
    like choose to to sort of to Zone in um to different levels of analysis to different
    sort of parts of the paper um and science is a no clickbait situation so if we&amp;#39;re
    if we&amp;#39;re writing a good paper the title is a summary the abstract is a
    summary and then the paper itself will have sort of repetitive summaries within
    it um so so yeah so we&amp;#39;re going to look at this this so this is figure
    one which will be referenced in the article somewhere yeah here so figure oh that&amp;#39;s
    S1 so S1 is supplemental figure um but yeah so if you this even they&amp;#39;re
    even they&amp;#39;re citing figures which are not in the main article they&amp;#39;re
    in this only you have to go to the supplemental information to get the get the
    results there um but this is the first one I&amp;#39;m seeing Figure 1 C represents
    this figure and the letter corresponds to this section here the figure will always
    have a caption the caption will always have a sort of one sentence summary of
    like what we&amp;#39;re looking at here and then each lettered subsection will
    have some little write up of what&amp;#39;s going on in that section um so yeah
    um yeah so this one is kind of doing uh like I said I think generally figure one
    should always be a methods figure and that you should also always or ideally have
    representative data this is doing both this is both a methods paper methods figure
    and a representation of Representative data okay so what were they actually doing
    here um so looking at stal Central pattern generators in mammals they&amp;#39;re
    looking at it in rats specifically or they&amp;#39;re using a rat as their model
    organism they don&amp;#39;t they don&amp;#39;t actually care about rats that much
    they&amp;#39;re but they&amp;#39;re using rats as a proxy animal that we believe
    has sufficient complexity that if we learn something about how supping Works in
    a rat that will be helpful in getting uh a treatment into humans and I happen
    to know that if you look at what this guy&amp;#39;s been up to recently they have
    been able to apply this stuff in humans and I think they are actually like getting
    to the point of I don&amp;#39;t know about like fully healing but I think they
    are restoring voluntary control of locomotion after a paralyzed spinal cord injury
    so I I haven&amp;#39;t checked in on him in a couple like two or three years I
    guess so um but he&amp;#39;s like he&amp;#39;s like one of these like Mega people
    like they if you go to sfn he has like several rows that&amp;#39;s just like a
    bunch of people that work in his lab because he just you know he&amp;#39;s like
    the it&amp;#39;s like a like a business owner type of thing so it&amp;#39;s a
    very very different vibe if you have like a lab with 150 people in it versus if
    you have a lab like mine which has like three people in it so uh I don&amp;#39;t
    want to run a lab like that that sounds terrible um so the idea was so they they
    they they took the M the rats and they yeah um so they took the the rats and they
    they gave them a surgical spinal cord injury they they went to in there and they
    they they gave them an injury that damaged their spine and severed all the fibers
    going to their brain so this is a picture of the central nervous system of a rat
    these are the two loads of the brain and then this is I&amp;#39;m not going to
    draw it uh but this is the spinal cord itself and the idea here this is kind of
    like the clever part is so this is the spine they didn&amp;#39;t just cut straight
    across um they did two cuts one like 60% of the way through up here and then a
    little bit below it they cut it again going down there so all of the fibers that
    are going through here get severed but they&amp;#39;re not just chopping it out
    so there is still a sort of a path hypothetically to go through so if it was possible
    for these fibers to kind of regrow and reform and reconnect to each other then
    you could theoretically have a signal coming from here and sort of like bypassing
    these injury points and getting back up to the brain um and so the idea was that
    they so this is and this is the process of sort of the decerebration part that&amp;#39;s
    sort of similar to what they did in the Cat video um and literally it just you
    know they went in there and did surgery on these rats and went in with a little
    scalpel and cut them in certain areas and I&amp;#39;m sure if you go yeah adult
    threat received a left lateral over hem section at thoracic T vertebrae t7 and
    a right lateral hem section at T10 one of those things like if you knew what all
    those words meant then you would be able to say oh okay I understand all the details
    there over hem section means a little over half so they they didn&amp;#39;t go
    to the halfway point they went over that um and so then what they do and so see
    if I can uh this on so now we put the mouse the rat mouse rat in this little robotic
    G entry system so this this is a uh there&amp;#39;s other studies on this particular
    system but this is kind of the 2012 version of that little wire wire uh support
    and treadmill thing from the cat um and so basically what they were able to do
    is it&amp;#39;s like I think this is the best picture we&amp;#39;re going to get
    in here and actually yeah I think well the almost certainly the supplemental information
    for the paper has many many things to say about this particular robotic system
    but basically it&amp;#39;s like a kind of like a 3D printer if you ever seen that
    where it&amp;#39;s kind of like a a a motor control that sort of moves over a
    2d plane and then it sort of goes down to this kind of like supportive mechanism
    oh jeez and it supports the mouse of the Rat um partial body weight support so
    it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not floating off the ground but it&amp;#39;s also
    not holding its full body weight and and um and it allows it to turn and stuff
    like that while maintaining that body weight support so you know no matter what
    happens it&amp;#39;s detecting what&amp;#39;s going on and it&amp;#39;s always
    making sure that the rat has you know 10 to 20% of its body weight on the ground
    the say and sure enough as we are sort of not surpris to learn um even after so
    this is the the activity also they they hold it upright so it walks in this kind
    of like bipedal way which is sort of would be cute if it wasn&amp;#39;t so mob
    um and this is what intact means not chopped up um so the intact uh animal looks
    the the behavior looks like this so the trajectories in blue here are the trajectories
    of the feet um and this is all and they go here so we&amp;#39;re not we are not
    shocked to learn that um even after uh yeah that even after this injury they can
    still walk decently okay like if you put them in a little robotic thing and drag
    them along they can walk just fine there&amp;#39;s this complicated sort of like
    electrochemical thing that they put into their spine to make sure that the neurons
    are still sort of active and healthy and sort of firing hard enough to move the
    limbs um what they found with those cats is that even like the video you saw was
    probably right after that surgery was done but typically what happens is the behaviors
    kind of extinguish over time so like after a couple of hours or days or I think
    not more than not more than weeks um the cat would stop doing that behavior and
    if you put it back on the trebal would just kind of wind up dragging its feet
    um and so one of the results that they built on from their own labs building this
    sort of combination of like a pharmaceutical cocktail and a particular electrical
    stimulation pattern that allows them to keep the animals do like the deated animals
    doing this movement for a sort of arbitrary amount of time um and uh and yeah
    so that&amp;#39;s I think that&amp;#39;s the main that&amp;#39;s the setup so
    we&amp;#39;ve got these we&amp;#39;ve got these they&amp;#39;ve been deated and
    they can do this sort of walking task and good for them um and so now here&amp;#39;s
    where so that&amp;#39;s all cool but none of it is shocking this is all stuff
    that we already knew when we showed the Cat video um so they&amp;#39;re specific
    thing that they&amp;#39;re trying to do is restore the animals ability to initiate
    walking um so a lot of this stuff is kind of like they&amp;#39;re dragging it
    along like on a treadmill so it it gets this stimulus that it needs like the feet
    drag and they sort of pick then sensory signals pick up and they start taking
    steps um but that but the the rat cannot just sit there and just decide to start
    walking forward um so they&amp;#39;re trying to restore that ability to do that
    and this is where there&amp;#39;s a lot there&amp;#39;s a lot going on here in
    terms of methodology that I&amp;#39;m not there&amp;#39;s just too much depth
    to get into but I will say that they then they broke the animals up into two groups
    um one of the animals one of the groups of animals was getting the um the control
    condition I guess which was training so they they would they would do this surgery
    to them they would give them this Electro chemical prosthetic that allows them
    to sort of keep walking and then they would put them in this sort of robotic suit
    and they would have them do this like movement training so it take a bunch of
    steps in a bunch you know in a row um then the other group and this is where I
    think the main sort of like interesting nut of the paper comes in the other group
    would do a matched amount of training so a matched amount of steps but before
    they would start the robot thing pulling them forward they would put chocolate
    in front of their face and apparently rats like chocolate and so they put the
    chocolate in front of their face and the r goes oh I really want the chocolate
    and then the robot kind of pulls them forward and then they do the stepping behavior
    and then they get to eat the chocolate that was sort of presented to them so now
    we have two match groups of rats one is being trained and taking a bunch of steps
    with this robotic Gantry system the other is doing the exact same behaviors but
    they are being given a motivating a motivating food thing then they do the exact
    same steps and they receive the food as a reward for doing that and in the last
    2 minutes of class if you sort of dig into all of this stuff what happens is that
    the animals that only do the base training don&amp;#39;t get better and eventually
    they the behavior still becomes extinguished and they sort of they never regain
    that capacity the animals that get the chocolate reward experience this kind of
    regrowth pattern where they over enough time they see these connections getting
    formed that sort of bypass the injury site and over time they can put the chocolate
    in front of the the rat and the rat can actually initiate the stepping behavior
    before the robotic Gantry kind of pulls them forward and that is I think really
    amazing and the idea is that it Taps into the kind of the way that we that we
    move our bodies in the world it wasn&amp;#39;t enough for the for the for the
    control rats to keep doing the stepping Behavior because it wasn&amp;#39;t connected
    to anything in the world around it whereas the ones with the chocolate condition
    um they had the experience of oh there&amp;#39;s a state there&amp;#39;s something
    out there in the world that I want it&amp;#39;s in front of me I need to walk
    to get it they start walking they don&amp;#39;t know that they&amp;#39;re being
    dragged by a robot and then as a result of that behavior they get to eat the chocolate
    and so when that happens it triggers this other concept of the dopamin neric reward
    system where basically basically the the brain gets flooded with this reward chemical
    that called dopamine and a bunch of other stuff that basically has the the the
    effect of reinforcing all the neurons that were just firing just dup energic award
    system is kind of how that works and so it&amp;#39;s that connection between that
    sort of that frontal area that volitional sort of prefrontal lobe cortex thing
    of I wish I was over there so I could eat the chocolate and then a bunch of neural
    fa activity happens then you get to eat the chocolate and then your brain gets
    flooded with neurons that say whatever was just happening reinforce that and then
    that is enough to trigger regrowth of neurons at the spinal level and that is
    as much as I&amp;#39;m going to say about this paper and uh end of class so thanks
    for following along and uh I&amp;#39;ll see you all on Wednesday going to do two
    papers someday I&amp;#39;ll learn I&amp;#39;ll never learn

    text: "Okay, all right, hello everybody. Sorry for the slow start. I was trying\
      \ to get some stuff downloaded that I should have downloaded at home. So, standard\
      \ check-in: we are officially in week number six, which is a fine place to be.\
      \ We\u2019ve covered a lot of material; I would say we\u2019ve covered the majority\
      \ of the hardcore biomechanics stuff. I almost mentioned the motor control topics,\
      \ but I will get back to that. \n\nThis week, we\u2019re going to spend some\
      \ time talking about published papers. Today, we\u2019ll go through some examples\
      \ of articles that I really like and have experience with, and we\u2019ll try\
      \ to make sense of them. On Wednesday, we will have a small group assignment\
      \ to help you prepare for the exam and the poster proposal, which will likely\
      \ be connected and due at the end of this week or next week. \n\nSo, to recap,\
      \ I\u2019ve discussed some topic area information usually in the review. We\u2019\
      ve spent a good amount of time recording data in class, just eyeballing it,\
      \ looking through it, and figuring out what stories could be told. We started\
      \ with some basic hypotheses and ideas. \n\nWhat I want the next two periods\
      \ to focus on\u2014next Monday is a holiday, so we\u2019ll actually have three\
      \ classes\u2014is preparing you to think about your own chosen topics, whatever\
      \ that may be. I want you to use the thought processes and mental frameworks\
      \ that I\u2019ve been discussing in the context of human body and movement research\
      \ based on kinematic motion capture data. \n\nThis will involve figuring out\
      \ what your topic area is. You\u2019ve done some of that already, but I encourage\
      \ you to dig a little deeper. Start to think about the methodologies used in\
      \ your area of interest. I understand that we gathered information through a\
      \ combination of discussions about topics and selecting a paper. That paper\
      \ is technically the most relevant part of the poster proposal, but I want it\
      \ to be framed within the context of your interest in that topic. \n\nFlesh\
      \ out the methodologies involved in your area of research. What tools are used\
      \ to collect the relevant data? How do they relate to the conversations we\u2019\
      ve been having about cameras and motion capture? What core empirical tools are\
      \ involved, what do they measure, and what data types and structures inform\
      \ the scientific insights in your area of focus? \n\nThis will culminate in\
      \ a proposal number two, which will be a more detailed version of your initial\
      \ paper interest description. I\u2019ve been thinking about how to structure\
      \ that assignment. It will exist on Canvas and in the GitHub repo, involving\
      \ you copy-pasting text from your profile and entering it into a chat with a\
      \ bot that will prompt you. \n\nThe idea is that you will take the most relevant\
      \ text about your interests and chosen paper into a chat space. The bot will\
      \ ask you questions based on the topics I\u2019ve discussed. At the end of that,\
      \ you\u2019ll request a summary using a prompt that I\u2019ll provide. You will\
      \ then take that output into another chat, allowing for another layer of conversation.\
      \ The results from these conversations will resemble the poster proposal, fleshing\
      \ out what you are looking at. \n\nI considered creating a single chat for this\
      \ process, but that becomes complicated. These AI systems are not good at following\
      \ multi-part instructions. It's easier to create two separate prompts. This\
      \ way, you will set yourself up for the next conversation and gain experience\
      \ with directed prompting. The prompts will stem from the lectures available\
      \ on our YouTube playlist linked in the server. \n\nI\u2019ll be extracting\
      \ main points from those lectures to drive our conversation. Therefore, I consider\
      \ this chat setup as exam-like, where you will need to complete specific tasks.\
      \ Failure to complete these will affect your grade, and the tasks will build\
      \ on what we\u2019ve done earlier, fulfilling the definition of a test. By the\
      \ end of week seven, you will be set up to start working on the actual poster\
      \ with a fleshed-out approach. \n\nThe lecture pulling is why I\u2019m not ready\
      \ to provide anything today. I have been uploading videos, and it takes a long\
      \ time. I\u2019ll have everything prepared and ready by next Wednesday, so we\
      \ can discuss it in class. You\u2019ll be able to ask questions. \n\nNow, I\
      \ want to talk about the posters themselves and will put some templates into\
      \ the server. Before we move on, are there any questions or concerns? Is there\
      \ anything you\u2019d like to know to feel more comfortable about your status\
      \ here? Someone sent me an email asking about the poster structure, which we\
      \ will cover today. \n\nThese examples I\u2019m showing are from previous courses\
      \ taught. I\u2019ve made it a bit difficult since I don\u2019t have PowerPoint\
      \ on this computer, but that\u2019s okay. Let\u2019s move on to the next part."

    text: "PowerPoint, Google Slides, and Keynote on Mac are all equivalent tools\
      \ for creating presentations. I'm sure many of you have PowerPoint slides, but\
      \ to make a long story short, the nice thing about tools like PowerPoint is\
      \ that they use vector-based graphics. This means that visuals are defined mathematically\
      \ rather than by pixels, as with most images. When you zoom in on a pixel-based\
      \ image, you start to see the individual pixels. In contrast, vector graphics\
      \ are defined by mathematical equations, so the curves in your designs are not\
      \ just sets of dots; they are based on formulas. This allows you to zoom in\
      \ infinitely without seeing any pixels because vector images are not pixel-based.\n\
      \nRaster graphics, on the other hand, involve most images where, if you take\
      \ a screenshot and zoom in, you can only zoom in to the limit of the image\u2019\
      s resolution. Most posters are created using a vector-based visualization method.\
      \ I would say PowerPoint is like the entry-level version for most people. For\
      \ nearly all of you, except for those with a very specific interest in design,\
      \ I recommend using PowerPoint or Google Slides to create a single slide that\
      \ contains information about your poster.\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling fancy and\
      \ want to explore more professional tools, the main vector graphics editor to\
      \ consider is Adobe Illustrator. You all have free access to Adobe Creative\
      \ Suite through your Northeastern email. If you\u2019re unsure how to access\
      \ it, ask someone else how to get access. To use it, you\u2019ll want to download\
      \ Creative Cloud and log in with your Northeastern account. However, first,\
      \ you may need to go to a specific website and submit a request for a license,\
      \ which can take a day or two.\n\nFor those looking for a free alternative to\
      \ Adobe Illustrator, there's Inkscape. I have used it, but when I was in grad\
      \ school, it wasn't very effective and didn't seem like a viable alternative.\
      \ However, I have used it recently, and it has improved significantly. For basic\
      \ usage, it might be helpful, but don\u2019t expect it to match the capabilities\
      \ of Illustrator. Realistically, if you\u2019re new to this space, you won't\
      \ be using the pro tool to its full potential, so you can give Inkscape a try.\n\
      \nRegardless of what you choose, the preparation of the content for your poster\
      \ will be independent of the actual poster format. If you decide to use a more\
      \ sophisticated tool and later change your mind, you can always convert to a\
      \ different method. \n\nNow, what should actually go on the poster? Basically,\
      \ a poster distills the information from a paper. This is not the only way a\
      \ poster can be used, but for our class, this is the standard purpose. Typically,\
      \ it represents a study that you are conducting, which you would take to a conference\
      \ and present alongside your poster, hoping that people will come by and discuss\
      \ it with you.\n\nAt the end of the semester, around the week of April 7th,\
      \ there will be a poster session for all inquiry classes. You\u2019ll be assigned\
      \ a day to present your poster alongside half of the students from each of the\
      \ other classes. If you are not presenting, your assignment will be to review\
      \ a certain number of posters from this class and other classes, providing you\
      \ with the experience of what this process entails.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier,\
      \ there\u2019s a default version of the poster assignment. I will mainly discuss\
      \ this standard version, which involves selecting a paper and presenting its\
      \ content as if you were discussing the paper itself. You don\u2019t need to\
      \ role-play or pretend to be anyone in a lab; simply introduce your paper in\
      \ the third person.\n\nYou have the option, if desired, to include additional\
      \ citations or discuss different aspects related to your research. If you would\
      \ like to use any data that we\u2019ve examined in class for your poster, I\
      \ will set that up so you can pull screenshots and discuss them. This option\
      \ allows you to incorporate real data you\u2019ve worked with into your presentation.\n\
      \nNow, regarding how to construct the poster itself, we\u2019ll go over several\
      \ instructions. When creating your poster from a specific paper or topic area,\
      \ the key idea is to avoid crowding the poster with all the information included\
      \ in the paper. You don\u2019t want what we affectionately refer to as a \u201C\
      wall of text\u201D poster, as it's overwhelming and not engaging for the audience.\n\
      \nIt is essential to emphasize that the scientific process is fundamentally\
      \ about communication. If you are collecting data and running analyses in solitude\
      \ without sharing it, you are conducting an investigation but not truly doing\
      \ science. The process of science involves exchanging ideas, and when you present\
      \ a poster, it serves as a traditional method of communicating your findings.\n\
      \nAlthough presenting a poster at a conference isn't officially a peer-reviewed\
      \ event, it functions similarly, as you're getting feedback from peers with\
      \ expertise in the area of your topic. They'll have the opportunity to provide\
      \ input and point out any mistakes, which is a cornerstone of scientific practice.\n\
      \nSo, as you translate your research project into a poster, think about how\
      \ to distill your findings effectively. You are likely the person who understands\
      \ your project better than anyone else, and those who will approach you will\
      \ only have a few minutes to discuss your work. For instance, during large conferences,\
      \ there will be thousands of posters, and attendees won't spend excessive time\
      \ on each one. They will engage for just a few minutes, so it is crucial to\
      \ communicate your project clearly and concisely."

    text: "As the presenter, your job is to convey the study and its findings in a\
      \ manner that allows listeners to grasp the essential points within three to\
      \ five minutes. If done correctly, the audience should leave with a basic understanding\
      \ of the poster, knowing what the study was about and what results were found.\
      \ A well-prepared presentation ensures that they understand the key takeaways,\
      \ even if they don't know all the details of the study.\n\nThere\u2019s a strategic\
      \ element to how you design a poster. The main takeaways should align with the\
      \ points you want your audience to remember. Given that any research study has\
      \ multiple facets, you can present the same information in different ways, which\
      \ may lead people to have varying interpretations. Thus, packaging your information\
      \ clearly and effectively is crucial so that when someone references your study,\
      \ they correctly convey the main points you intended.\n\nIf the audience remains\
      \ silent, it\u2019s not necessarily a sign of disinterest; often, conference\
      \ attendees are exhausted and want to understand the gist of your work. In academia,\
      \ if someone starts picking apart your work with questions, it\u2019s actually\
      \ a positive sign. It indicates that they care enough about your research to\
      \ engage deeply and inquire further.\n\nHowever, this might be off-putting to\
      \ students accustomed to receiving grades based on binary evaluations. It\u2019\
      s important to realize that questions stem from curiosity and a desire to understand\
      \ the work better. As a scientist, my role includes critically evaluating research,\
      \ which involves looking for errors and seeking clarity\u2014not to attack but\
      \ to ensure the integrity of the work being presented.\n\nWhen presenting a\
      \ poster, avoid merely reading the text to your audience, as this can be tedious.\
      \ Instead, present the information at a high level and be ready to answer questions\
      \ as they arise. Though it may seem overwhelming, after a few presentations,\
      \ you'll find that many questions are predictable. Anticipating these inquiries\
      \ allows you to prepare clear, concise responses based on the data presented.\n\
      \nFor instance, while describing a study involving a mouse maze, focus on the\
      \ study's findings rather than getting bogged down in the specifics of the apparatus.\
      \ If someone asks about the depth of the water or the dimensions of the equipment,\
      \ you should be able to provide that information, and ideally, your visual materials\
      \ should make these details apparent at a glance.\n\nThere should be a methods\
      \ section in your poster with visual representations of what was done in the\
      \ study. This helps your audience quickly understand the experimental setup.\
      \ For example, if your study involved mice in a water maze, a diagram illustrating\
      \ the experimental conditions would be immensely beneficial.\n\nAs a general\
      \ principle, the first figure in your poster or paper should visually summarize\
      \ what was conducted. In addition, results need to be presented in a way that\
      \ encapsulates the recorded data harmoniously. It\u2019s essential to identify\
      \ the most significant findings; among potentially many figures in your paper,\
      \ your job is to determine which results best support your conclusions.\n\n\
      The introduction typically outlines the rationale behind the study and includes\
      \ relevant citations. Describe why this research was necessary and how it builds\
      \ upon previous work. Break it down into research questions and hypotheses,\
      \ if applicable. A methods section should clarify what you did, followed by\
      \ a representation of the main results, leading to a succinct conclusion that\
      \ summarizes what new understanding emerged from your research.\n\nIn essence,\
      \ after guiding your audience through this process, you want them to accept\
      \ your conclusions based on the evidence provided. If they find your arguments\
      \ compelling, it advances towards becoming what is perceived as a scientific\
      \ fact\u2014though one must remain cautious, as scientific understanding evolves\
      \ over time and what is accepted today may be corrected in the future.\n\nIn\
      \ summary, avoid reading your poster verbatim to your audience; instead, ensure\
      \ that the poster serves as a helpful aid to your presentation, facilitating\
      \ discussion and reinforcing the key points of your work. Remember, when presenting\
      \ data, you\u2019ll want to highlight representative data and provide the statistical\
      \ measures that support your findings. This approach enhances credibility and\
      \ ensures a successful communication of your research objectives and findings."

    text: "Appropriately documented, you are allowed to look at the large body of\
      \ data that you have and pick a particular recording that is representative\
      \ of what you are trying to show. In this case, they put mice in a water bucket,\
      \ and then they had to learn where the platform was so they could get out of\
      \ the water. In our case, we were doing tasks like the jumping task or the standing\
      \ task. For the standing task, imagine we recorded 25 different participants,\
      \ and each of them did 10 different repetitions, leading to a total of 250 trials.\
      \ You can go in and pick one trial or even one section of one trial that exemplifies\
      \ the effect you are trying to show. You can then elaborate on that one little\
      \ part, clean it up, and present it, stating that this represents data from\
      \ a subject in the participant study. However, without additional support, that\
      \ is anecdotal; you are just picking one from a set of a thousand options and\
      \ saying, \"This is the one that looks like the story I\u2019m trying to tell.\"\
      \ That\u2019s not really evidence in itself.\n\nYou want to back that up by\
      \ having some kind of statistical measure that looks at all 1,000 trials you've\
      \ performed, appropriately comparing subjects to subjects, and conditions to\
      \ conditions. This is where you actually start having statistical power and\
      \ statistically supported statements. These are the data that ground real knowledge\
      \ generation. It's beneficial to pair both methods because the representative\
      \ subject data helps convey what you're talking about, while the statistical\
      \ data shows that this is a phenomenon that occurs in general, which will vary\
      \ based on the studies you are conducting.\n\nAs for posters, typically, if\
      \ you walk around a department in the school, you\u2019ll see posters on the\
      \ walls. People often display their favorite posters outside their labs, so\
      \ you can walk around and observe what they look like to get a sense of the\
      \ styles and choices available. You\u2019ll see some with a lot of words and\
      \ others with very few words. I recommend doing that at any time during the\
      \ day, as the various departments usually have posters on display.\n\nIn our\
      \ case, the poster sizes can vary significantly. I have attended conferences\
      \ where the posters are 60 inches by 40 inches\u2014very large. I\u2019ve also\
      \ been to some conferences where they are only 30 inches by 30 inches, which\
      \ is quite small. I believe our posters are 24 by 36 inches, but I need to confirm\
      \ that; it\u2019s important to know because it will affect the font size you\
      \ use. However, it primarily depends on ensuring that the font size is appropriate\
      \ and not overwhelming.\n\nAlso, you can Google \"scientific poster\" to find\
      \ many examples and tutorials on how to make effective posters. Most of the\
      \ content will apply here, except that you won\u2019t be writing the paper yourself.\
      \ Much of the material will involve copying and pasting from the paper directly\u2014\
      simply get the figure and place it up on the poster. The sections in the bottom\
      \ right are where you will include your citations, which should be generated\
      \ from your sources.\n\nThe poster needs to be uploaded by Tuesday, March 25th,\
      \ which means you\u2019ll upload a PDF that will then get printed. They charge\
      \ about twenty something dollars, though I need to verify this amount. This\
      \ deadline is on the Monday, two weeks before the actual poster session. Given\
      \ that the printing office receives hundreds of posters for this course, we\
      \ want to provide them enough lead time to print everything, especially in case\
      \ any issues arise.\n\nThere will be instructions on how to do this, and I will\
      \ drop these into the Discord server before putting them on Canvas so that they\
      \ are available. If there are any questions or confusion, please feel free to\
      \ ask. \n\nIs the assignment to just do my poster on one paper? Not really;\
      \ at the base level, the assignment is one citation of the actual paper from\
      \ which you derived your information. While I am looking for that, I can\u2019\
      t see where these citations actually occur in the poster. This may have been\
      \ done incorrectly; you are meant to cite sources. For this assignment, it\u2019\
      s a bit unusual, so the default assumption is that there will only be one citation,\
      \ the original paper you referenced. Still, you should cite it somewhere, either\
      \ in the introduction or the conclusion. For example, you might say, \"This\
      \ study is based on Smith and Jones (2018),\" which should be cited somewhere\
      \ in the text.\n\nIn default assumption, it\u2019s just the one paper. However,\
      \ as you delve into your paper, there might be other relevant studies to cite,\
      \ especially regarding future directions or follow-up studies that were conducted\
      \ after the original work. If a study uses a method you have not encountered\
      \ before, you should find a review article detailing that method, as that would\
      \ be worthy of citation as well.\n\nCitations in this context are often used\
      \ as a rubric; you might think you need a specific number for validity. That\
      \ is not how we engage with citations in the real world. You cite the work that\
      \ supports your understanding of the poster you are presenting. You are building\
      \ your study and this knowledge on the foundation of prior research. If you\
      \ rely on earlier studies, you must acknowledge them with citations. If someone\
      \ doubted your presented data, they could check the underlying studies, leading\
      \ into concepts of citation networks. This approach allows navigating empirical\
      \ work that has been done since, at least, the 1800s."

    text: "Keeping track of this stuff. For the strict assignment, it\u2019s just\
      \ one thing. In general, when it comes to posters, the citation thing is much\
      \ squishier. Posters are generally speaking an informal type of presentation.\
      \ Not always; some conferences are pretty serious about them. For the conferences\
      \ that are serious about their poster sessions, the posters are always paired\
      \ with a paper. You write a six-page paper or whatever to go along with a poster.\
      \ The poster itself, you often print for the conference, and then you just use\
      \ it to discuss at the conference. It\u2019s not going to go into, you know,\
      \ the annals of some scientific society or something like that. They\u2019re\
      \ generally just treated as a much more informal type of thing, and the actual\
      \ proper review process is done at the level of articles and papers. \n\nMake\
      \ sense? Yeah, anything else? Any other questions, thoughts, feelings? Cool.\
      \ All right, I\u2019ll be sure to plan some time somewhere, probably in this\
      \ two-week chunk. Oh yeah, due at the beginning of this week, so I\u2019ll plan\
      \ something in this chunk to practice your poster. I\u2019ll try to do it the\
      \ week before it goes, because often you put the poster together, and then you\
      \ start explaining, and you\u2019re like, \"Oh, this is not at all what I want.\"\
      \ So, we can do some kind of demo run probably in this week, so that you\u2019\
      ll have a chance to go through it with your peers before you\u2019re doing it\
      \ in person. \n\nIt is also absolutely standard experience that when you\u2019\
      re presenting a poster for the first time, the first couple of people that you\
      \ present it to get the worst version of the story. Generally speaking, by the\
      \ end of the session, which for a lot of conferences can be three or four hours,\
      \ by the end of that poster session, you have the story of your research so\
      \ perfectly down that it\u2019s like, if you ever find yourself going to a conference\
      \ and presenting a poster, I beg you to do yourself the favor of taking notes,\
      \ voice notes, text notes, whatever you can about what you\u2019ve been talking\
      \ about in your poster the moment the poster session is done. Because the story\
      \ that you\u2019re trying to tell will never be clearer in your mind than it\
      \ will be after you have presented it however many dozens of times you do.\n\
      \nWithin the context of how science operates and sort of a practical communal\
      \ sense, that is often the purpose of a poster session. It\u2019s not always\
      \ the case, but generally, it is. Posters and also talks\u2014most of the times\
      \ when you\u2019re presenting stuff at a conference, it\u2019s stuff that you\u2019\
      re working on. Typically, I mean, it sort of depends on the cycle, but I think\
      \ if you\u2019re really using the conference to its fullest extent, you should\
      \ be presenting stuff that\u2019s not quite done yet; it\u2019s not ready for\
      \ prime time, it\u2019s not published, it\u2019s not peer-reviewed. It\u2019\
      s the paper that you\u2019re currently writing, not the one that you just published.\
      \ Because the poster session, in particular, is a really great opportunity to\
      \ hone the story that you\u2019re telling. \n\nYou might have a certain way\
      \ of saying it that, like, the first couple of times you do it, people don\u2019\
      t really get it. Then you figure out some turn of phrase that makes everyone\
      \ go, \"Oh, right, now I see what\u2019s going on.\" That\u2019s the way that\
      \ you want to describe it. You\u2019ll often find this is the most classic student\
      \ behavior that ever exists: you will describe it in way too much detail. Eventually,\
      \ you\u2019ll learn all the details that you can leave out that help people\
      \ understand what it is with the minimum amount of time. That\u2019s the way\
      \ you should learn how to talk about the stuff that you\u2019re doing.\n\nThere\u2019\
      s a very classic behavior, especially for grad students. When grad students\
      \ start presenting research, the amount of time they spend discussing a particular\
      \ area is proportional to the amount of time that they spent working on that\
      \ area. That\u2019s almost never what you should do. It\u2019s possible that\
      \ whoever these people are spent a good four to five months trying to figure\
      \ out how to make the water in the stupid thing stop leaking out. They kept\
      \ using something that wasn\u2019t working, and they figured out the glue, and\
      \ then blah blah blah blah blah. When they actually got it working, the data\
      \ just kind of fell out of it. So when they give the presentation, they\u2019\
      re going to spend the first half of the conversation talking about all the glue\
      \ that they had to use and how they sort of got the water up to the right level.\
      \ That stuff shouldn\u2019t even be a part of the conversation. \n\nSometimes\
      \ when I\u2019m giving a presentation, I\u2019ll just say, \"This slide transition\
      \ was six months of my life,\" and then I just show the result where it worked,\
      \ not the fifteen iterations of failed attempts that I had to do before I got\
      \ the version that works. If the things that you were doing to make it work\
      \ are interesting, you might want to record them in another place. But a poster\
      \ is almost never that time. \n\nThen, that might be the case where someone\
      \ comes along and asks, \"How did you get your stupid thing to fill up? Because\
      \ ours keeps leaking.\" That\u2019s when you can say, \"Oh yeah, we used this\
      \ glue and not the other glue.\" That\u2019s the place where, at the end of\
      \ the paper you wind up publishing, you can have a very long methods section\
      \ that explains why you had to use this glue and not the other glue. \n\nIt\u2019\
      s the process of kind of distillation that I think is really the crux of this\
      \ assignment. It is your job as the ambassador of this research study to make\
      \ the judgment call about what\u2019s the most important part and what\u2019\
      s the narrative that we\u2019re going to try to pursue here. All right, we good?\
      \ Cool. We will have plenty more opportunity to talk about this stuff in your\
      \ specific cases. \n\nWith all of that said, let\u2019s go and look at a paper.\
      \ We have approximately 40 minutes left, and I am going to attempt to look at\
      \ two separate papers, which is a terrible idea because I\u2019ve already done\
      \ the thing of saying this is going to have an end in the lecture. I love the\
      \ papers I\u2019m talking about, and I\u2019m going to want to dive deeply into\
      \ them. But I think it\u2019s fun to do the quick run-through. I\u2019ll try\
      \ to keep myself to a particular time.\n\nI will also finish up a thought I\
      \ meant to have half an hour ago. After we do this sort of aside around the\
      \ papers, the assignment, and the exam-like object, we\u2019re going to transition\
      \ into vision stuff, like eyeballs. I\u2019ll bring in an eye tracker, and we\u2019\
      ll talk more about visual neuroscience. I\u2019ll record some eye tracking data\
      \ similar to how we did before. It\u2019s going to be a bit of a different vibe\
      \ there just because of the nature of the equipment and the data, but we\u2019\
      re going to do vision stuff, which is always fun. Vision, and specifically eye\
      \ movements, which are technically part of motor control because they involve\
      \ muscles, but it\u2019s an interesting space there. \n\nOkay, so in 20 minutes\
      \ or less, which will put us at 4:10, I\u2019m going to look up some information."

      m storing it. There we go: 2012. This used to be a new study; now it\u2019s\
      \ old. That\u2019s not that old; it\u2019s just over a decade at this point.\
      \ This is a paper published in Science, which is one of the bigger journals\
      \ out there. There are two journals that are considered the biggest and most\
      \ prestigious: Science and Nature. That sort of cultural reality of there being\
      \ a biggest thing is generally toxic and leads to a lot of bad outcomes, but\
      \ nonetheless, if you see something published in Science or Nature, that\u2019\
      s generally a good and prestigious study. Generally speaking, the more generic\
      \ the name of the journal is, the more prestigious it is. For example, the Portuguese\
      \ study of ankle prosthetics research is generally going to have lower prestige\
      \ than the Journal of Prosthetics, which is going to be lower prestige than\
      \ the Journal of Biology, which means Science and Nature are about as big as\
      \ you can get in that space. Also, Cell is a very good journal for biology.\n\
      \nBecause we are on campus, I could just download this here, but just for fun,\
      \ we\u2019re going to go to Scopus and look it up that way. I\u2019m using this\
      \ Dark Reader thing, so I\u2019ll turn that off so it looks like it would normally\
      \ look. Okay, I have about 15 minutes to go through this. I probably won\u2019\
      t get to a second; we\u2019ll see. So, this is kind of normal. When you download\
      \ the PDF, the front page just has basic information about the study, including\
      \ the title, author list, journal, and links to things like supporting material\
      \ and references that cite this article. With modern papers, there\u2019s typically\
      \ supplemental data, or supplemental methods and stuff like that. Modern contemporary\
      \ journal articles tend to have very constrained lengths, so the core studies\
      \ are typically going to be quite short unless it\u2019s a journal review or\
      \ something older. This varies very much by journal. To get around that, they\
      \ often include supplemental materials, meaning either methods will not be part\
      \ of the word count or you have the opportunity to present additional data.\n\
      \nWhat I\u2019m going to do now with this study, since I know it quite well,\
      \ is try to give you a high-level overview of this paper that is fast enough\
      \ to do in the next 15 minutes and comprehensible enough for you to follow the\
      \ story despite not being particularly trained in this area. Ideally, it will\
      \ also be a fair and honest representation of what was actually done, so if\
      \ you were to read this paper in depth, you would find that everything I said\
      \ about it is an accurate representation. I\u2019m creating a cartoon narrative\
      \ of the study to present it to you in a way that will handle itself. If you\
      \ became an expert in this area and on this paper, ideally, you would be able\
      \ to evaluate my choices of simplification and understand why I chose this form\
      \ of the narrative.\n\nThis study is about the spinal cord, specifically looking\
      \ at spinal cord injury and trying to achieve something akin to the Holy Grail\
      \ of medicine: the ability to heal spinal cord injuries. When you have an injury\
      \ or accident that damages your spinal cord, you may lose control of your limbs\
      \ below that area. You might lose control of your legs or your whole body, depending\
      \ on where the injury occurs. We would really like to correct that in some way,\
      \ similar to how we can address issues when you break your ankle or damage muscle\
      \ or skin. We would love to be able to correct that for a person.\n\nHere is\
      \ the abstract of the paper. Different journals format this in different ways;\
      \ this one isn\u2019t even labeling it as the abstract; they assume you know\
      \ that. Sometimes it might be called a summary or something else. I noticed\
      \ that on the actual website, they provide a high-level summary in addition\
      \ to the abstract, but all the information should really be there. This study\
      \ builds on attempts to heal spinal cord injuries, but it does not look at patient\
      \ populations; they\u2019re not looking at people with spinal cord injuries.\
      \ They are specifically studying rats. If you look at these citations, they\
      \ refer to actual clinical studies and medical studies. However, they are not\
      \ doing research on humans. This is an application with basic science motivation;\
      \ they\u2019re trying to increase theoretical understanding in order to move\
      \ towards this applied goal. They are building on a history of studies of Central\
      \ Pattern Generators in mammals. These Central Pattern Generators exist in many\
      \ animals and generally refer to neural architectures that generate rhythmic\
      \ activation, which is the basis of a lot of motor behavior and general life.\n\
      \nFor example, this is a really fun animation of an ant walking in an alternating\
      \ tripod gait. The red represents one tripod, and the blue represents another\
      \ tripod; that\u2019s how insects operate. That\u2019s a rhythmic behavior.\
      \ Breathing is also a rhythmic behavior, and most forms of locomotion are rhythmic\
      \ activities. This rhythmic behavior is present in invertebrates like insects\
      \ and also in mammals like humans."

    text: "The spinal central pattern generators in cats are the focus of a particular\
      \ study that investigates central pattern generators (CPGs) and their role,\
      \ especially as they exist in the spines of invertebrates. There is a general\
      \ question surrounding the presence of CPGs in lower animals, which can be studied\
      \ in detail because they are simpler. Researchers can observe these functions\
      \ as they open them up, but the question then arises: what is the role of these\
      \ types of neural architectures in more complex animals like mammals, which\
      \ possess many more neurons and exhibit more complex behaviors, yet share the\
      \ same evolutionary history?\n\nThis video, which is quite old and comes from\
      \ a different era regarding animal rights, shows a cat that has been decerebrated.\
      \ It's somewhat difficult to see, but this cat is being supported, and it has\
      \ had its spinal cord severed. To clarify, the brain and cerebellum remain intact,\
      \ but the spinal cord has been severed in such a way that no information is\
      \ transmitted from the legs to the brain, nor from the brain to the legs. The\
      \ legs are still connected to the spinal cord. The interesting result here is\
      \ that if the cat is supported and walks on a treadmill, its hind limbs still\
      \ engage in the rhythmic behavior of locomotion, driven by sensory-motor loops\
      \ from the feet through the spine and back.\n\nThis finding contradicts our\
      \ usual intuitions about how the spine functions; we tend to think of it merely\
      \ as a conduit for signals traveling from the brain to the muscles. However,\
      \ this research shows that there is processing occurring within the spinal cord\
      \ itself. It forms part of the central nervous system and can manage simple\
      \ tasks, such as generating the necessary behavior when sensory information\
      \ is relayed from the feet. For example, if the cat is pushed backward, it will\
      \ instinctively lift its hind legs, move forward, and then land again, with\
      \ the two limbs being activated reciprocally by central pattern generators.\n\
      \nEven without cerebral input, as the treadmill speed increases, the cat\u2019\
      s hind limbs also increase their pace, which may seem surprising\u2014it feels\
      \ wrong. The result is indeed wild and perplexing across several dimensions,\
      \ which is why I find it so intriguing. Often in empirical investigations, unexpected\
      \ results can lead to the most profound insights, as they challenge our preconceived\
      \ notions.\n\nFor the remainder of the class, we will focus on this particular\
      \ study, even though I initially intended to discuss a second study related\
      \ to dragonflies. We\u2019ll explore that after we\u2019ve covered more about\
      \ vision and dragonflies. This significant and baffling study has been known\
      \ for some time, establishing that there are CPGs that govern movement. They\
      \ are responsible for basic transitions between different forms of movement,\
      \ like moving from a stance to a swing.\n\nResearch has continued to develop\
      \ since its discovery. At some point, the rules around animal rights evolved,\
      \ influencing which animals can be used for research. For instance, it is now\
      \ prohibited to use cats for certain studies; instead, similar studies are conducted\
      \ using rats. In fact, a well-presented TED talk exists regarding such research,\
      \ featuring Greg Lut\u2019s captivating presentation.\n\nIt\u2019s important\
      \ to recognize that my retelling of this story is based on how I have internalized\
      \ it. My background and perspective as a scientist shape my narrative, and it\
      \ can differ significantly from how the original study authors might narrate\
      \ their findings or how someone with a completely different background might\
      \ present it. This highlights the element of narrative in discussions about\
      \ empirical studies\u2014these studies are conducted by humans, and we often\
      \ remember stories that make sense to us.\n\nAs I continue, I\u2019ll delve\
      \ into the structural aspects of this paper. All authors credited contributed\
      \ in some way; typically, the first author is the individual who made the most\
      \ significant contributions to the work. Often, this is a graduate student or\
      \ a post-doctoral researcher. The last author is usually the senior author,\
      \ often the head of the lab where the study takes place. This is a prevalent\
      \ practice, though variations exist depending on the specific field and type\
      \ of study.\n\nWhen you\u2019re in graduate school or a post-doctoral position,\
      \ there's a marked difference in how first-author publications are viewed versus\
      \ second-author publications. Generally, you are likely to have more second-author\
      \ publications than first-author ones. Once you begin to run a lab, colleagues\
      \ and peers will begin to inquire how many last-author publications you possess,\
      \ indicating whether you are training others in the field effectively."

    text: "To do this work appropriately, that\u2019s very field-dependent. Math people,\
      \ when they publish math papers, publish their authors alphabetically, which\
      \ is wild to me. What I'm describing here is sort of a standard cultural practice\
      \ in contemporary scientific publishing. Down here, you have all these little\
      \ citations showing what these numbers correspond to, such as where they're\
      \ working. Most of the work was done in Switzerland. It's also going to tag;\
      \ here\u2019s a tag that says these two authors contributed equally to this\
      \ work. This is a way that people try to get around the issue of first authorship.\
      \ I guarantee there was a discussion about, despite them being starred, who\
      \ actually gets to be first. This is also important: this is the corresponding\
      \ author. This little symbol indicates that if you want to ask a question about\
      \ this paper, you should contact this person. That\u2019s typically included.\
      \ I will go to the end just because, again, from a structural perspective, there\u2019\
      s always going to be acknowledgments somewhere in the paper. They will thank,\
      \ for instance, a person who helped with the robotic interface, and they will\
      \ also always cite their funding sources. So, where did the money come from?\
      \ In this case, they list several grants from European research councils. This\
      \ is an expensive study with numerous grants, and there's typically something\
      \ acknowledging the NIH for giving a grant or whatever. Typically, this is another\
      \ place where they say, \"Thank you for funding this grant,\" and they specify\
      \ the grant number so you can look up the public grants, which most of these\
      \ are. You can go look up the grant that funded this research and see what was\
      \ discussed there. It's another way that people keep connected to the larger\
      \ community while publishing particular papers.\n\nYeah, modern papers also\
      \ tend to have sections that list what each author did. For example, one author\
      \ helped collect the data, while another wrote the paper. There will be a paragraph\
      \ or two saying what each author did to earn their spot on the author list.\
      \ This particular study shows Figure 1. This style of figure is very common\
      \ in science and nature journals because these journals are very short and dense.\
      \ This is specifically a report; journals often have articles, which are full-length,\
      \ reports, which are shorter, and brief communications, which vary in length.\
      \ This is a report that is a shorter format, and the whole study consists of\
      \ five pages, including the front page, meaning there are only four written\
      \ pages of text. If you go to the supplemental documents, it typically looks\
      \ like a Microsoft Word document converted to PDF and can span dozens of pages.\n\
      \nThis picture is dense with lettered sub-panels and has a professional-looking\
      \ animation or visualization indicative of this type of journal. If you look\
      \ at more standard bread-and-butter types of journals, like the Journal of Biomechanics,\
      \ the figures will generally appear more like they were made by a regular human\
      \ rather than by a professional graphics design team, which is the case here.\
      \ When I look at a new paper, I will look at the title and the authors, see\
      \ if I recognize any names, and check where they are working. I read the abstract\
      \ and skim the paper, usually starting by looking at the figures. I typically\
      \ never just sit down with a new paper and read it from start to finish like\
      \ a novel; that\u2019s just not how we generally interrogate scientific papers.\
      \ It\u2019s more like JPEG compression, where you skim at different levels to\
      \ get the full picture before choosing to zone in on different parts of the\
      \ analysis. Science is a no-clickbait situation: if we\u2019re writing a good\
      \ paper, the title provides a summary, the abstract summarizes, and the paper\
      \ itself contains repetitive summaries within it.\n\nSo, this is Figure 1, which\
      \ will be referenced in the article somewhere. Figure S1 is a supplemental figure;\
      \ they are even citing figures that are not in the main article; you have to\
      \ go to the supplemental information to access them. This is the first figure\
      \ I\u2019m seeing. Figure 1C represents this figure, and the letter corresponds\
      \ to this section here. The figure will always have a caption, and the caption\
      \ will have a one-sentence summary of what we\u2019re looking at, and each lettered\
      \ subsection will have a short write-up of what\u2019s going on in that section.\
      \ I think generally, Figure 1 should always be a methods figure, ideally with\
      \ representative data. This is doing both; it serves as both a methods figure\
      \ and a representation of representative data.\n\nWhat were they actually doing\
      \ here? They were looking at central pattern generators in mammals, specifically\
      \ using rats as their model organism. They don\u2019t care much about rats,\
      \ but they use them as proxy animals, believing that if they learn something\
      \ about how this works in a rat, it will be helpful for treatments in humans.\
      \ I happen to know that if you look at this researcher\u2019s recent work, they\
      \ have been able to apply this in humans, and I think they are getting closer\
      \ to restoring voluntary control of locomotion after spinal cord injuries. I\
      \ haven\u2019t checked in on him in a couple of years, but he\u2019s one of\
      \ those prominent researchers. If you go to the Society for Neuroscience conference,\
      \ he has several rows of people working in his lab. It\u2019s a very different\
      \ vibe compared to running a small lab like mine, which only has three people;\
      \ I don\u2019t want to run a lab like that; it sounds terrible."

    text: "They severed all the fibers going to their brain. This is a picture of\
      \ the central nervous system of a rat. These are the two lobes of the brain,\
      \ and this is the spinal cord itself. The idea here, and this is kind of the\
      \ clever part, is that they didn't just cut straight across. They did two cuts:\
      \ one about 60% of the way through up here, and then a little bit below it,\
      \ they cut it again going down. So all of the fibers that are going through\
      \ here get severed, but they\u2019re not just chopping it out. There is still\
      \ sort of a path, hypothetically, for these fibers to regrow, reform, and reconnect\
      \ to each other. Then you could theoretically have a signal coming from here,\
      \ bypassing these injury points and getting back up to the brain. This is similar\
      \ to the decerebration process they did in the cat video. They literally went\
      \ in there, did surgery on these rats with a scalpel, and cut them in specific\
      \ areas. If you look at the details, the adult rat received a left lateral hemisection\
      \ at thoracic T7 and a right lateral hemisection at T10. The term 'hemisection'\
      \ means a little over half, so they didn\u2019t go to the halfway point; they\
      \ went beyond that.\n\nNow, we put the rat in this little robotic gantry system.\
      \ This system, similar to previous studies, is a 2012 version of that little\
      \ support and treadmill mechanism used for the cat. Basically, they were able\
      \ to create a situation similar to a 3D printer, where it moves over a 2D plane\
      \ and then descends to this supportive mechanism. It supports the rat's partial\
      \ body weight; it's not floating off the ground, but it's also not holding its\
      \ full body weight. It allows the rat to turn and move while maintaining some\
      \ body weight support. It detects what's going on and always ensures that 10\
      \ to 20% of its body weight is on the ground.\n\nAs we are not surprised to\
      \ learn, even after the injury, the rats can still walk decently. If you put\
      \ them in this robotic setup, they can walk just fine. There\u2019s a complicated\
      \ electrochemical process involved to ensure that the neurons in their spine\
      \ are still active and healthy enough to move their limbs. In the case of the\
      \ cats, we learned that after surgery, typically, their behaviors extinguish\
      \ over time. After a couple of hours or days\u2014not more than weeks\u2014\
      the cats would stop performing that behavior, and if you put them back on the\
      \ treadmill, they would just drag their feet.\n\nOne of the results from their\
      \ labs involved combining a pharmaceutical cocktail with a specific electrical\
      \ stimulation pattern that allowed the deafferented animals to continue moving\
      \ for an arbitrary amount of time. Now, this is the main setup: these animals\
      \ have been deafferented, and they can perform a walking task. That part is\
      \ intriguing, but none of it is shocking because we already knew this from the\
      \ cat video.\n\nThe specific goal is to restore the animals' ability to initiate\
      \ walking. Most of the earlier work involved dragging the animal along, using\
      \ the robotic system, which provided the stimulus needed for the feet to move,\
      \ prompting sensory signals that enable stepping. However, the rat cannot just\
      \ decide to start walking on its own. They are trying to restore that ability.\
      \ There\u2019s a lot of depth to the methodology here, but I will mention that\
      \ they broke the animals into two groups. One group received the control condition,\
      \ which was training. They performed surgery, received an electrochemical prosthetic\
      \ to help them walk, and then they used the robotic suit for movement training.\n\
      \nThe other group participated in a matched amount of training, but before they\
      \ started the robotic system, they were presented with chocolate. Apparently,\
      \ rats really like chocolate. Therefore, they placed chocolate in front of the\
      \ rats, prompting them to want it. When the robot pulled them forward, they\
      \ did the stepping behavior and then got to eat the chocolate reward.\n\nNow\
      \ we have two matched groups of rats: one being trained and taking steps with\
      \ the robotic gantry system, and the other doing the exact same behaviors but\
      \ being given a motivating food reward. In the last two minutes of class, if\
      \ you examine all of this, the animals that only underwent the base training\
      \ do not improve and eventually their behavior extinguishes completely; they\
      \ never regain that capacity. Conversely, the animals that received the chocolate\
      \ reward experienced a regrowth pattern, where they gradually formed connections\
      \ that bypassed the injury site. Over time, they could initiate the stepping\
      \ behavior before the robotic gantry pulled them forward, which is quite remarkable.\
      \ This taps into how we move our bodies in the world; it wasn\u2019t enough\
      \ for the control rats to keep stepping without connection to anything in their\
      \ surroundings. The rats with the chocolate reward had the experience of wanting\
      \ something out in the world in front of them. They needed to walk to get it,\
      \ and while they were unknowingly being dragged by a robot, they ended up eating\
      \ the chocolate as a result of their behavior. This triggered the brain\u2019\
      s dopaminergic reward system, flooding the brain with dopamine and other chemicals."
