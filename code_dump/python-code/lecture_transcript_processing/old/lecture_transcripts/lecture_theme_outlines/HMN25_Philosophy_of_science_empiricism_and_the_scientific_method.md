# HMN25: Philosophy of science, empiricism, and the scientific method

## Abstract
The theme of "Philosophy of science, empiricism, and the scientific method" is a foundational aspect of the HMN25 course, emphasizing the importance of empirical research, measurement, and the scientific method in understanding human perceptual motor neuroscience. This theme explores the philosophical underpinnings of scientific inquiry, the role of skepticism, and the process of generating knowledge through empirical methods. Key highlights include:

- The scientific method as a structured approach to knowledge generation.
- Empiricism as the basis for making predictions and building tools.
- The philosophical origins of belief and skepticism in scientific reality.
- The role of measurement and SI units in empirical research.
- The importance of truth-preserving processes in scientific inquiry.

## Comprehensive Outline

### Introduction to the Scientific Method and Empirical Research
- The course aims to teach students about the nature of science and the process of generating knowledge.
- Understanding the world requires specificity and clarity, especially in empirical research.
- The scientific method and empirical method are essential approaches to knowledge generation, highlighting the challenges involved in knowing and understanding the world.

### Empirical Measurement and Knowledge
- Empirical measurement is foundational for making predictions, building tools, and healing.
- The concept of measurement is often taken for granted, but it is essential to understand its meaning.
- Knowledge generation is relative; new knowledge builds on existing knowledge and experiences.
- The term "truth preserving" is significant in the philosophy of science, indicating that knowledge is interconnected.

### Philosophical Foundations of Science
- Skepticism is emphasized as a basis for scientific reality; beliefs must be examined and justified.
- The philosophical origins of belief are traced back to Descartes, who questioned the basis of knowledge and introduced "Cogito, ergo sum" as a fundamental truth of conscious experience.
- Conscious experiences are the only undeniable truths, while perceptions and memories can be deceptive.
- Solipsism, the belief that only one's own mind is sure to exist, is presented as an uninteresting philosophical position.
- Trusting in memory and statistics allows for the construction of knowledge about the real world.

### Measurement and SI Units
- Direct empirical measurements must be based on something tangible, such as distance.
- The instructor uses a stick as a measurement tool, illustrating how measurements are recorded and represented.
- The lecture explores various ways to measure space and time, starting with space.
- SI units stand for "standard international," a French term meaning "international standard."
- The base SI units include seconds (time), meters (length), kilograms (mass), amperes (electrical current), Kelvin (thermodynamic temperature), moles (amount of substance), and candela (luminous intensity).
- The instructor emphasizes the importance of using SI units in scientific studies, prohibiting the use of imperial units like inches and pounds.

### Dimensions and Cartesian Coordinates
- Measurement begins with understanding dimensions: one-dimensional, two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and high-dimensional objects.
- Cartesian coordinates are named after René Descartes, who conceptualized defining a position using reference points.
- The transition from two dimensions to three dimensions involves moving from squares to cubes.
- Points can also be defined using angular coordinates, involving right-angle definitions onto basis vector axes.

### The Role of Empiricism in Scientific Inquiry
- Empiricism is the basis for making predictions, building tools, and healing.
- The concept of measurement is often taken for granted, but it is essential to understand its meaning.
- Knowledge generation is relative; new knowledge builds on existing knowledge and experiences.
- The term "truth preserving" is significant in the philosophy of science, indicating that knowledge is interconnected.
