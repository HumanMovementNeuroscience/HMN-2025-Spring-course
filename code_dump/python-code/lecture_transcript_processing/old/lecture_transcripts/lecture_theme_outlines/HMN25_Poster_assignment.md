# HMN25: Poster assignment

## Abstract
The "Poster assignment" theme in the HMN25 course focuses on guiding students through the process of creating a scientific poster based on empirical research in human perceptual motor neuroscience. This involves selecting a singular empirical research paper, developing a detailed proposal, and effectively communicating research findings through a poster presentation. Key elements include:

- Emphasis on selecting empirical studies over review articles for deeper understanding.
- Use of AI tools to assist in navigating scientific language and personalizing learning.
- Development of a poster proposal that distills research findings into a concise and engaging format.
- Guidance on poster structure, design, and presentation strategies to effectively communicate research.

## Comprehensive Outline

### Introduction to Poster Assignment
- **Selection of Empirical Research Paper**
  - Importance of choosing a singular empirical research paper for the poster proposal.
  - Avoidance of review articles to ensure a deeper understanding of the research topic.
  - Encouragement for students to provide a topic area and a paper they are considering, along with the abstract, for discussion and guidance.

### Role of AI in Poster Development
- **AI-Mediated Tools**
  - Assistance in navigating complex scientific language found in abstracts and papers.
  - Tracking student interests and providing personalized support throughout the learning journey.
  - Flexible and personalized approach to learning, contrasting with traditional professor-defined structures.

### Encouragement of Student Engagement
- **Engagement with Interests**
  - Encouragement for students to engage with their interests and curiosities in the field.
  - Emphasis on personal exploration and the uniqueness of each student's academic journey.
  - Exposure to new concepts rather than requiring complete understanding of all material presented.

### Proposal Development
- **Detailed Proposal Creation**
  - Development of a more detailed version of the previous paper outline.
  - Use of a chat bot to facilitate discussions about the chosen topic, prompting exploration of different research layers.
  - Summarization of discussions and integration into the poster proposal.

### Poster Creation and Structure
- **Structure and Design**
  - Discussion on the structure of scientific posters, with examples from previous courses.
  - Templates for posters provided for student reference.
  - Emphasis on understanding poster structure and content to aid in preparation.
  - Use of vector-based graphics tools like PowerPoint, Google Slides, and Keynote for creating posters.

### Effective Presentation Strategies
- **Communication of Research**
  - Aim to convey the essence of the study within three to five minutes.
  - Highlight key points to ensure audience retention of important aspects.
  - Avoid reading the poster verbatim; provide a high-level overview.
  - Anticipate predictable questions and prepare relevant answers.

### Data Representation and Statistical Support
- **Selection of Representative Data**
  - Selection of representative recordings from a larger body of data to illustrate findings.
  - Importance of statistical analysis to support claims and enhance validity.
  - Combination of representative subject data with statistical data for comprehensive communication.

### Poster Size and Design Considerations
- **Design and Legibility**
  - Variability in poster sizes, with typical size for the course being approximately 24 by 36 inches.
  - Importance of legible font size and overall readability.
  - Inclusion of citations to establish research credibility and allow verification.

### Practice and Refinement of Presentation Skills
- **Rehearsal and Feedback**
  - Opportunities for students to rehearse presentations with peers.
  - Focus on results rather than excessive detail about the process.
  - Importance of distillation in research narrative.

### Transition to Vision-Related Topics
- **Future Exploration**
  - Transition to examining vision-related topics, particularly eye movements, as part of motor control.
  - Exploration of eye tracking data collection similar to previous demonstrations.

### Conclusion
- **Integration of Learning**
  - Integration of learned concepts into the poster assignment.
  - Emphasis on effective communication and presentation of research findings.
- **Preparation for Poster Presentation**
  - Preparation for presenting research in a concise and engaging manner.
  - Encouragement for students to engage with the scientific community through poster presentations.
