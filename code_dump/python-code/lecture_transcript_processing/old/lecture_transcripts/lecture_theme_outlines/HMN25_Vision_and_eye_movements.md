# HMN25: Vision and eye movements

## Abstract
The theme of "Vision and eye movements" in the HMN25 course explores the intricate processes involved in visual perception and the neural mechanisms that control eye movements. This theme delves into the physiological and neural basis of vision, the role of eye movements in gathering visual information, and the methodologies used to study these processes. Key highlights include:

- The process of visual perception, from light entering the eye to complex visual processing in the brain.
- The role of eye movements in directing gaze and making decisions based on visual information.
- The use of eye tracking as a research tool to study visual attention and information processing.
- The integration of visual perception with motor planning and execution.

## Detailed Outline

### Introduction to Vision and Eye Movements
- Vision is a critical component of human perceptual motor neuroscience, involving the conversion of light into neural signals and complex processing in the brain.
- Eye movements are essential for directing gaze, gathering visual information, and making decisions based on visual stimuli.

### Visual Perception Process
- Light enters the eye, travels to the retina, and reaches the fovea, where opsins, molecules tuned to different wavelengths, are located.
- Opsins change shape upon absorbing photons, altering their electrochemical properties and initiating neural activity.
- This process changes the electrical potential of rods and cones in the retina, transmitting signals down the optic nerve.
- Visual processing occurs in the occipital lobe (visual cortex), where initial information about edges and light patches is computed, progressing to identify complex structures and objects.

### Neural Activity and Vision
- Neurons communicate through electrical pulses, encoding information about the visual environment.
- The visual processing pathway involves multiple stages, with the occipital lobe playing a key role in initial processing.
- The distinction between epistemology (our understanding) and metaphysics (what truly exists) is highlighted, emphasizing the evolving nature of scientific narratives.

### Eye Movements and Oculomotor Control
- Eye movements are compared to breathing, occurring both automatically and under conscious control.
- Oculomotor control is crucial for directing gaze and making decisions based on visual information.
- Eye tracking is a primary research tool, utilizing video-based trackers to gain insights into visual attention and information processing during tasks.

### Methodologies in Vision Research
- Eye tracking provides a clearer picture of human actions during complex tasks, generating ecologically valid results.
- The rapid nature of eye movements (about 150 milliseconds) is emphasized, highlighting their instinctive role in gathering information.
- Combining eye tracking with other methodologies, such as motion capture, enhances the understanding of human perceptual motor processes.

### Integration of Vision and Motor Planning
- Visual perception is integrated with motor planning and execution, involving the motor cortex and cerebellum.
- The concept of peripersonal space is introduced, processed in the parietal lobe, and influenced by visual input.
- Proprioception and the body's awareness of joint forces and positions contribute to movement coordination.

### Challenges and Limitations
- The complexity of visual processing and eye movements presents challenges in fully understanding these processes.
- Methodological limitations, such as the precision of eye tracking and the complexity of neural networks, are acknowledged.
- The evolving nature of scientific understanding in vision and eye movements is emphasized, with future corrections to current beliefs anticipated.

### Conclusion
- Vision and eye movements are integral to human perceptual motor neuroscience, involving complex interactions between sensory input, neural processing, and motor execution.
- Continued research and methodological advancements are essential for deepening the understanding of these processes and their role in human behavior.
