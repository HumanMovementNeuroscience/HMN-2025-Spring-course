full_transcript: 'okay hello hello hi thank you welcome to whatever this is um so
  yeah let''s Okay so let''s do the standard check-in thing so I am recording this
  and we''ll be posting it online um a couple people so people have sort of sporadically
  been contacting me and saying like hey I''m sick I''m not going to make it to class
  hey I''m not going to make the deadline that St of stuff if you''re sick straight
  up don''t come to class like we had a whole ass pandemic so like please let us learn
  that lesson as a culture um you don''t need to check with me it''s totally fine
  I trust you uh also the deadlines are all kind of made up so like you know I put
  them on there in the sense of like I really hope everyone has it done by this point
  because I like I use the data from that for each stage um but they''re all available
  until the end of the semester so with the exception of the poster thing there''s
  a couple like hard deadlines for that that like you know you have to get it to the
  printer on time and stuff like that um everything else just kind of like just get
  it done as soon as you can which I understand is a dangerous thing to say to some
  people but um I I trust you I believe in you just check all the boxes before the
  end of the semester we''ll be good to go um so quick check in on schedules and stuff
  what did we do last Wednesday can you remind me did I talk or did the group thing
  group thing yeah group thing group thing was good group thing uh uh with bot yeah
  great uh and then we had something that was due and today today what fun we''re
  going to be talking about a lecture that I''ve given like a bunch of times and I
  always enjoy giving it and it''s going to be intro to measurement and the concepts
  and what kns there to pertaining um and check this out look what you get to do when
  you''re in charge no assignment great feel like we''ve been doing we''ve been doing
  enough you guys are doing great um okay uh is this the right day this is the right
  day cool um oh so so today''s lecture is going to be about like measurement units
  and things like that sort of like hopefully more it''s got a lot of props and visual
  aids and whatnot um and I want to do it now because on Wednesday I think we can
  do a free moap inclass recording uh which will be our first relationship with like
  sort of more classical data like I I keep referring to like this the text stuff
  that you''re punching into the server as data and it is Data um but it''s kind of
  like you know if you asked me three years ago if that was Data I''d be like yeah
  I guess technically but it''s only since like AI came online that I think of that
  as data um uh freeo cap is a motion capture sort of you know free open source thing
  that I''ve been building for the past half decade or so of My Life um and it''s
  specifically designed to sort of like make good class demos and things like that
  so we''re going to be recording some dat and then talking about it in the Contex
  of the kind of Concepts we''re going to go over today um so hopefully we can get
  some of that in today um let''s see anything else to catch up on um just for completeness
  I will remind everybody although I didn''t nothing special has happened with this
  this round but the server so in in the server in the links and resources find the
  server scrape checkpoint and and there is the same sort of at the bottom 127 so
  that''s the server scraped and analyzed as of this morning um so same thing download
  it unzip it if you don''t know what unzipping is it''s the thing where you double
  click in and it makes a folder next door um that you can open like a regular thing
  um so you can search for your name in there I''m going to be refactoring the way
  that we do the student profile building thing so like your individual profiles are
  going to change probably next week um just because I''m going to change theof the
  code and prompts that make it um I realized that it would probably give you a much
  more precise measurement of who what you''re interested in if I didn''t use everything
  you put in the server for the profile but just use the assignment chats so the ones
  from your intro and the poster presentation thing um and I''m also you know in the
  process I might also set something up that you can sort of in a given chat you can
  like ask the bot to remember you and it will pull that history into the conversation
  and that will sort of you don''t have to start every conversation from scratch type
  of thing um uh yeah also by just by way of reminding um sort of the word helping
  you guys learn the paths and whatnot um here we are on the server same channel up
  here links and resources and course Repository click on that and something pops
  up I don''t know why two things pop up um this is the course repository this is
  the sort of the most up to-date oh actually I forgot to do this last time update
  syllabus syllabus commit in sync yes thank you don''t break and now up here where
  go all right same thing on fireof Fox and you see it says update syllabus that was
  the thing I just pushed up and now the code is not the code the text is uh which
  is you know code that code for primates um and that''s updated this is called a
  this is GitHub that''s kind of what GitHub does it''s a Version Control software
  it''s kind of like track changes but um more sophisticated um pretty much every
  piece of software you''ve ever used in your life has used git at some level um and
  I''m kind of like hijacking it to do text based stuff um so yeah and also just to
  be clear just for fun um so this site is basically as if it was a folder the read
  me here is the thing that''s posted down there uh this is what it looks like formatted
  that''s what it looks like raw this is a honest measurement and record of exactly
  what my primate body did to a keyboard at some point in time so it is a truth preserving
  record of my thoughts in a way that a docx file or a Google Drive Link sort of will
  never be so shout out to markdown in raw text formats okay right so on this page
  go back to the front page hey uh there we go in the lectures folder in 20 25127
  intro to measurement and the top one is called intro to measurement and here we
  go it''s the what''s it called the notes for my notes for the lecture that we''re
  about to give and with that I''m going to switch away from the GitHub and go to
  my local version just because I want to uh local meaning on this machine not on
  the internet some other servers machine GitHub is own by Microsoft so technically
  that state data is hosted on Microsoft um this is on my computer okay cool this
  is a brief summary we''ll see how much we get through I think we''ll get through
  all of it so here we are in this class extensively to teach y''all what science
  is what science looks like how you might ever do such a wacky thing as to attempt
  to know the world and do Empirical research within it um and there''s a lot of things
  that get taken for granted by when you sort of just live as a human person in a
  world um that you start to find yourself needing to get much more specific about
  once you actually start to trying start trying to get into the business of knowledge
  generation so the idea as a scientist is that you are attempting to create new knowledge
  for humankind um which is a very difficult thing to do it''s hard to know stuff
  um and there''s certain rules for how to do that um so a lot of what we talk about
  in The Sciences the empirical Sciences is based on the concept of empirical measurement
  so um there are many ways to know things um the scientific method and empirical
  method is one way to know the world it''s a very powerful way to know the world
  because it allows you to do things like make predictions about the future build
  tools uh heal people when they''re sick things like that um and everything is sort
  of in that sort of conception of knowledge is is based on at some level an empirical
  measurement uh of the world where yeah empirical measurement is we''re going to
  talk a little about what that means but BAS basically it''s the idea that you have
  done yeah you''ve done some kind of a measurement and that''s what that term measurement
  is one of those kind of like one of those terms that gets taken for granted but
  we''ll talk a little bit about what that means um so the most important thing to
  sort of I don''t about the most but one of the most one of the very important things
  to think about when you''re thinking about Empirical research and the concept of
  measurement is that everything that you''re doing everything that you''re building
  on has to be built relative to something else so when you''re trying to if you''re
  trying like if you''re uh trying to generate new knowledge that knowledge that is
  going to be sort of based on other things like I used the term earlier of Truth
  preserving a very important term in sort of philosophy of science um because that
  is the concept of being able to build from one thing that you know another thing
  that you might know and everything that you think you know about the world if you
  sort of dig into it is going to be based off some sort of background of well I think
  this because I think because I learn that because I believe this because of all
  that kind of stuff um so it''s helpful when you''re sort of trying to learn the
  concepts of measurement to try to recreate those epistemological chains where epistemology
  is the study of knowledge um and try to ask yourself sort of where these things
  connect to um if I were to redo this which I will some time I probably would have
  put this one up top so where the most important thing is that skepticism is the
  basis of scientific reality which is the other concept where skepticism is the idea
  long story short of you have to you have to have reasons to believe the things that
  you believe um you''re not allowed to just believe things for no reason um and everything
  that you sort of that you consider has to be kind of you know you have to look directly
  at it and try to boil down sort of what that is connected to um so given that it
  is reasonable to ask about Origins um and the sort of philosophical the the classical
  philosophical Bedrock of belief uh we tend to ascribe to this dude de cart who was
  operating in like the 1500s you''ve heard of his cartisian coordinates and other
  various things which we''ll talk about in various points in time um but he has quot
  is sort of trying to do this philosophical game of trying to understand what his
  knowledge of the world is based off of and came across this wonderful little phrase
  called kogito Eros which means I think therefore I am which is basically a fancy
  way of saying that if you really drill down to it the only thing that you can actually
  truly know and believe without reference to some other sort of piece of knowledge
  is that you are having a conscious experience right now in this very moment you
  are having a qualitative State you are thinking and be and nothing in the concept
  of the universe could ever fake the experience of having a conscious experience
  in this exact moment now your memories of what you did yesterday that could be fake
  you could have done Heist hallucinogenics you could have had some someone could
  be poking at your brain that could all be fake your perception of the world around
  you that could be fake I think I think there''s a cup out there but I could wearing
  some sort of crazy VR helmet it could be like floating in goop in The Matrix and
  so all of these other things that we want to believe um are all in some way shape
  and form um subjects of skepticism you you could deny you could doubt um that the
  the veracity of anything else besides that Central nugget of I am having a conscious
  experience right now in this moment now if you only want to live with that sort
  of nihilistic belief you were left with a rather un uninteresting philosophical
  position called solipsism which is the belief that you are the only person that
  exists and everything else around you was fake and all other people you see are
  just Illusions um that is technically I believe the only truly defensible philosophical
  position it''s also not useful or helpful or particularly interesting um because
  we we ALS because if you''re willing to accept other gradients of belief and gradients
  of Truth into your life you can start to build what feels like knowledge about the
  real world um as long as you''re willing to have things like you''re you''re willing
  to have things like trust in things like memory and if you''re willing to sort of
  smush together all your memory and then believe such thing as statistics you can
  actually do quite a lot with that because yes I can doubt I like I can doubt that
  there''s a cup in front of me right now but if I keep looking and it keeps happening
  and I keep moving and it has the sort of like geometrically reasonable deformations
  and then I reach out and then I have a cup in my hand and then I put it to my mouth
  and I get liquid at a certain point the accumulation of those sensory experiences
  starts to really resemble something like knowledge that I might have about the real
  world like it might it it starts to become increasingly likely that there is in
  fact something resembling a cup in what in somewhere outside of my conscious experience
  um and which is great because that''s what allows us to sort of we we match each
  other in this universe on the basis of our shared memories and statistics and luckily
  that doesn''t really it''s not really that hard to do but it is sort of troubling
  to think too closely about so from the epistemological point of view we''re going
  to base our knowledge on sort of the awareness that we exist which is good and then
  I really hate to say it but the only but on the other the other thing we have is
  memory and statistics not a lot but we can work from there um now with that I''m
  going to shift away from uh that sort of philosophical epistemological kind of like
  floofy exist Central crisis philosophy 101 type of space and shift back into the
  more like rigidly sort of imp Al grounded world of direct empirical measurements
  but we''re going to have a similar game to be played there where when we think about
  something like measurement um we still have to base that measurement on something
  so let''s talk about let''s talk about measuring things and let''s start I think
  simply simply enough with a really basic measurement called distance spatial distance
  um this lecture has a lot of uh props and visual aids all made roughly speaking
  out of garbage that I found outside um this is a stick that is kind enough to be
  roughly a meter long um and also can be screwed apart it was actually this like
  the stem of a lamp that I found and I didn''t wind up liking the lamp but then I
  realized that if I pulled it apart then I could stop having to pull a meter long
  broom stick onto campus once oh once a semester so so yeah you need to find one
  that I can see hiking stick could probably do well here okay so this is this is
  a stick this has let''s say such a thing as measurement as a as a length so if you
  wanted to measure things in the world you could use something like this let''s pretend
  that this is one meter long even though it''s actually slightly longer than that
  let''s pretend like it''s a meter and we wanted to measure something so let''s see
  thisle brought colors today so we''ll see how that goes for us uh RGB R green we
  start with black I guess so if we''re trying to measure the length of things let''s
  say we''re trying to measure the length of the room or how tall you are how tall
  this thing is whatever um we''re going to want to eventually re repres you know
  write these num so we''re going to have some sort of a measurement tool like this
  or a you know what''s it called tape measure something like that and we''re going
  to make some measurements and then we''re going to write them down um but when we
  write them down we''re going to be we''re writing down a number of some kind uh
  so and let''s sort of skip a couple steps to then get to the place where we''ve
  written down a bunch of numbers now we want to represent them sort of to communicate
  we''ve done a scientific study on how long various things are and we want to present
  this research to our conspecifics and colleagues so you have to write them down
  so we have various ways of measuring things like space and time um and we''re going
  to start with space and then we''re going to eventually get to time which won''t
  take which is actually not worry about it um so the first thing you might want to
  in measuring things you have things like Dimensions you have one dimensional two
  dimensional three dimensional High dimensional we''ll talk about these things in
  a second um and in all these cases it''s going to start with something resembling
  An Origin so this is the origin it is the it is a zero dimensional object um it
  contains no real information other than it exists right this is an or this is a
  point that doesn''t exist this is a point that does exists so this point conveys
  the information hello yes I exist and not really that much else not particularly
  useful scientifically but very important when you''re trying to figure out if I
  come to you and I say oh hey that thing is three and a half sticks long that is
  implicitly relative to something which is zero sticks long which is something that
  doesn''t which has no extent so Zero Dimensional gr great good job so now let''s
  think about this Dimension and let''s call it X because that''s traditionally how
  we do it and this is now a one dimensional object so let''s say this is infinitely
  long and we''ve measured this is one stick long so this stick is there so there
  you go so one one one stick long and then I can measure two sticks three sticks
  Etc that''s way better so now if I''m going around measuring things I can keep track
  of the length of the thing but again this is not particularly exciting this is there''s
  there''s not really a point of drawing that you just write down the number you don''t
  gain anything by looking at that number relative to zero other than just the knowledge
  of how numbers work so so that''s we''re going to call that X we''re also going
  to call that length great so now we want to measure such so and that''s good for
  measuring things like string or distances from here to your house or height of a
  person but now we want to go around we want to measure different things we''re still
  doing stuff in we''re still measuring length and distances and now we''re going
  to split and have a second dimension that we''ll call Y we''ll also call that height
  and it uses the same unit so you can still be one stick tall you can be two sticks
  tall things like that and so now you can measure things like boards and desks and
  floors and if you measure something in it''s two units long and then one unit tall
  then that''s a point in that space and that is a two-dimensional Point two-dimensional
  meaning it''s got two numbers you have to use to define it in the robotics world
  someday like we''re going to I know this is basic we will be ramping up from here
  um but another way to think about this is it''s two degrees of freedom meaning that
  if you want to know the area of something uh you need to know two numbers to be
  able to Define that entirely you need length you need width and you could do that
  in various other ways but this is a two dimensional number um so now you want to
  measure thing you want to keep going so you want to keep measuring something in
  a higher dimensional space so you''ve got length you''ve got area area is length
  times width or something like that and so now you want to also measure volume and
  with that I have run out of dimensions on the board I can no longer so this is an
  accurate one: one representation of the two-dimensional Point XY if I want to make
  a three-dimensional space I no longer have enough dimensions on this board because
  this board is a two-dimensional object so we can fake it and do this kind of like
  right angle thing let''s call this guy back here Z and think about how do we do
  this so we go so one two and then one two three so so this is XZ and then we can
  also pain that up that''s a little screwy but it''s fine you get it x y z great
  this is a three dimensional Point we''ve done it that''s great um so this is how
  you can measure if you''re trying to categorize objects according to their volume
  you need three degrees of freedom you need three numbers to Define that volume specifically
  and you can represent that spatially in this nice sort of three-dimensional grid
  here um now I don''t want to belabor this point too much because it will we''ll
  sort of get there but so this is three dimensions traditionally if you ever if you''re
  going to touch engineering this is the international symbol for threedimensional
  space x x y z this is the right hand rule um so doing it backwards here but it would
  be was that yeah it''s like this so XY Z XY z um this is a left-handed coordinate
  system it is illegal don''t do this just because of the rules um actually there''s
  more to be said there but we can SK past it um and so in three dimensions is how
  many we have in this in in space in three dimensional space in humans we are super
  good at a lot of spatial estimates and we really are very good at making things
  making um very quick calculations of things like the cup is is is in front of the
  bottle the cup is near the edge of the table those kind of spatial um what''s the
  word computations are very easy for us now there''s nothing special about three
  dimensions except for that that''s how many you need to define space and time but
  you can keep going with these numbers if you''re trying to define something that
  requires more than three numbers to Define um and again I don''t want to blab this
  point too much but I I will say that it has to do with Pythagorean theorem and like
  how you measure things like distance um because in one dimension the distance from
  a point to the to the origin is trivially sort of two so pyan is the one that''s
  a b c so a 2 + b^2 = C2 so c equal < TK of a + b a s plus bqu whatever so this is
  how you do distance you''ve all seen this I''m sure at various points in your high
  school career um this is the the particular case of doing Pythagorean theorem for
  two Dimensions you replace the A and B with X and Y and then you have a way to measure
  distance in a two- dimensional space in a one-dimensional space it''s very you know
  the square root of 2 to the 2 is just two so that''s easy to do um in two-dimensional
  space it''s just that in three-dimensional space to measure distance you just add
  a z you just do the measure the distance in in 3D space is the square root of x^2
  + y^2 plus z^2 and then you can just keep going you just there''s nothing special
  about two you can add a w you can add a l you can add a I don''t know M and just
  keep going and keep and you you lose the ability to plot it in a way that makes
  sense but you can keep doing all the same math that you were doing with three dimensions
  up to te million dimensions and a lot of the AI stuff the way that that works is
  it is it uses that same kind of like spatial math but it''s doing it in like very
  very high dimensional spaces which is one of those terms that you keep you hear
  people say things like high dimensional mathematics and it''s like oh my God it''s
  so crazy it just means that you keep adding numbers to the Pythagorean theorem to
  measure distance and everything else is pretty much the same um I will say too there''s
  a lot of we''re going to do like General like mathy stuff here um but luckily you
  don''t have to do any of the math you just have to understand it which is so much
  easier like because I know that there''s a part where I''m sort of I say oh look
  you can have two x y things like that and that like makes some intuitive sense um
  and I just need to promise you that that intuitive gut check of like yeah that makes
  rough sense that''s the vast vast vast majority of the things that you actually
  need to know about mathematics like being able to do it on paper helps um the guy
  who touchs the class before this I''m sure would have many things to say about what
  I''m about to say but I firmly believe that being able to do the math on paper is
  just it''s an extra layer of understanding on top of the gut check intuitions that
  will get you most of the way towards where you need to go um okay yeah so right
  now we''re talking about let''s make this simpler and just go back down to two Dimensions
  because it''s easier there we go 2D great um so this is we call these cartisian
  coordinates because ofart because Western science and math likes to name things
  after the people that discover them which is annoying as hell because the same people
  discover so many things that you end up replac using all these words all over again
  it''s really obnoxious um but these are called cartisian coordinates ostensibly
  named for C deart who the story is that he was he was like a sickly guy and he was
  like in his bed and was watching a fly crawling on a window and realized that he
  could Define the the fly''s position by just looking at the intersection point between
  the fly and these two points on the window sill and then thus made some formalisms
  and then get to name a whole you get to name the concepts of a grid after this guy
  which is annoying but so this cartisian space is typically defined by things like
  it''s got straight lines it''s got grids it''s got squares if you go you you know
  go from two Dimension to three dimension you go from a square to a cube things like
  that you could also Define this type of stuff in angular coordinates so I''m if
  I care about this point in space I could Define it using these sort of like straight
  line you know right right angle projections onto these basis Vector axes I could
  also say that it''s you know this far away at that angle off of zero so I start
  by I I start from this sort of you know we''ll call they call it X and then we go
  up by this angle which can be degrees or radians or whatever you want then we go
  out by this number R by some distance and we still get to the same spot in 2D space
  and so in and so instead of defining this in terms of XY I could also Define it
  in terms of theta row which row is just like the distance row like radius like if
  this was a circle it would be whatever that''s not actually what row means but that''s
  fine and so again noticing that this is a two-dimensional point two degrees of freedom
  and I can Define it either in these linear XY coordinates or I can Define it in
  these angular Theta row coordinates um because yeah you need two numbers to Define
  its position and so two numbers you get uh once you start if you were to go from
  so this is a good way to draw circles if you go from 2D to 3D they become spheres
  and the important thing to know is that you can always switch back and forth between
  the linear coordinate systems or the spherical coordinate systems the sort of we
  call these polar coordinates versus cartisian coordinates and in practice when you''re
  doing stuff you wind up just switching back and forth depending on what you''re
  doing in the math like you know if I''m looking at things like joint angles it''s
  really helpful to look at it in terms of polar coordinates because there''s already
  got angles in it in fact it''s even easier than that because we looking at one of
  these guys this distance we can just assume never changes so now if I''m looking
  at something like joint angles if I assume that these are rigid bodies and and the
  and the r doesn''t change then now I only need one number to Define where it is
  and not two so now I have like one less number to deal with which is great because
  we have too many numbers already that doesn''t make sense it might tomorrow um let''s
  see I''m going to skip some of this because it gets too we''re getting pretty mathy
  pretty quick and this is going to I think make more sense um once there''s data
  to look at um but the other thing I guess I''ll say just by way of completeness
  um we''ve we''ve been talking about ways of measuring space um and we also should
  talk about ways of measuring time you''ll hear you hear terms like spatio temporal
  coordinates spatio temporal calibration whatnot remember that''s an O term so spatio
  temporal is just spatial SLT temporal it just means you''re thinking about both
  space and time and when you''re looking at data like this it''s very common to see
  in 2D plots want to keep that I don''t think I need to keep that you see it''s really
  common to see stuff presented like this where this this x axis is time and then
  the y axis is some measurement over time so if we''re thinking that Y is going to
  be let''s say it''s height of my hand off the ground and then at Time Zero we''re
  going to measure it and it''s one so there we go time zero that''s me at one and
  then we''re going to wait let''s say a second and then we''re going to measure it
  let''s say it''s now one and a half units off the ground I have time one doing there
  if I keep moving up it''s going to keep going up and if I wind up doing this with
  my hand then you''re going to see dots doing like that and then if you connect all
  those dots and you''ll start seeing things like squiggles and this is called a Time
  series because it''s a series of measurements over time so this is a one-dimensional
  measurement so I''m just getting height and I''m measuring it once per time unit
  which could be seconds it could be if it''s a video like this then it''s going to
  be 30 frames per second so it''s once every 33 milliseconds you know if it''s a
  microphone that records at 44 ktz then it''s once every one over 44,000 44,000 over
  one or one over 44,000 seconds um but and that''s how you get measurements over
  time and the important thing to see is you''ll often see this presented as connect
  as a straight as a connected line but that''s not actually what you''re measuring
  um you''re only ever going to be measuring something at time intervals you''re going
  to be getting one measurement per time interval and so you and so this is what your
  data actually looks like um so if we we have to assume that the movement between
  the measured interval is kind of like cerent like what we expect it to be and if
  we do that then we can connect the lines and get a nice time series but if this
  is one measurement every second and I''m doing this with my hand then it actually
  doesn''t look like that under the hood if this if these intervals is like one every
  you know millisecond then we can trust that if it''s one every second I could just
  as easily be doing this with my hand and we only get these measurements every second
  so if we interpolate going to be missing a lot of the story um yeah so that''s time
  um and I''ll just say it just because it''s on the thing uh similar to space time
  can also be thought of in in two basic forms linear time sort of like a stopwatch
  and phasic time which is like a clock where it resets to zero every every Circle
  through the available values that will become important in the future um blah blah
  blah if you care about calculus the you know if this is the position the slope is
  the velocity because it''s the change in position over time if you do that again
  you get acceleration so velocity is the derivative of position acceleration is the
  derivative of velocity then you go back with the integrals that''s all the calc
  you ever need to know as far as I care um okay so yeah so that''s measurement right
  and we''ve been we''ve been talking about these measurement in terms of kind of
  these like abstract units so you know singular sticks whatever doesn''t really it
  doesn''t matter like in the same sort of methods of plotting will work no matter
  what it is that you''re no matter what units you''re looking at measuring distance
  we might use meters if we measuring temperature we might use Celsius or kelvin if
  you''re measuring weight you might use kilograms um and the same sort of plotting
  representations will sort of work throughout uh now this is a practical thing that
  you should keep in mind and will come up at some point in your future um but when
  we''re talking about the Sciences there''s rules about the units that we''re allowed
  to use um we''re here in a America where we have things like imperial units for
  like you know feet and inches and stuff like that um which are often kind of people
  talk about them as like these are Bonkers worthless measurements and they kind of
  there''s a good argument for that but uh the reality is that a lot of our Imperial
  the Imperial measurements that we tend to use are based on very factorable numbers
  like 12 and 16 because it is easier to do that kind of math in like a home environment
  um whereas metric is B off of T which is very good for things like decimal points
  and precision but kind of harder to cut into even so 10 you only get to cut into
  two and five whereas 12 you get two and five before you start needing things like
  fractions uh 12 you have one two three four six and 12 um so if you''re imagining
  that you''re like a vendor in some medieval town and you have like a bunch of Weights
  that you have to bring to measure out your stuff it''s easier to have stuff weighed
  in terms of 16s and 12 like things like baking and stuff like that is easy because
  it''s really easy to cut things in half and by Third and stuff like that um but
  in the Sciences we are required by law to use SI units uh by law I mean convention
  um SI units stands for standard international it''s a French term that means International
  standard um and there are a set number of of them so here is the Wikipedia page
  and these are all of the base SI units for time we have seconds for meters we have
  for length we have meters for Mass we have kilograms for electrical currents we
  have ampers for thermodynamic temperature we have Kelvin uh for amount of substance
  we have mole and for luminous intensity we have Candela um for the most part around
  here we''re going to be mostly thinking about these ones so C second met kilog uh
  now this is one of the now we get to the first visual eight uh now one of the cool
  things about the metric system is that a lot of the parts match up so this is if
  this was one meter which it''s not but it let''s pretend that it was if this was
  one meter and this was one liter which it claims to be um this is everything we
  would need to recreate the majority of the metric system so the way that it''s defin
  a a liter is a th000 milliliters a milliliter is a cubic ctim of water and a cubic
  centimeter of water weighs one gram so if you have a centimeter and you got get
  a make a cube of that of that shape and put water in that Cube and measure the the
  weight of it um that is defined as I don''t know if it''s defined as but it''s uh
  that cubic centimeter of water weighs one gram if you were then get a thousand of
  those things together it would weigh one kilogram and a thousand of those centimeters
  cubic centimeters of water ccs would equal one liter and one liter uh weighs 1 kilogram
  so you get it''s kind of this fun sort of Correspondence there where you get a lot
  of the if you know what how long a meter is and you have standardized water um you
  can recreate a lot of the units that we we wind up using here um yeah yeah and then
  the meter stick it turns out traditionally it was measured as this this stick in
  France it used to be there used to be like an actual stick like this um but I guess
  it it''s like rusted away over time so now it just represents some markings on a
  stone we have since moved away from this method of determining a meter and now use
  it as we measure it in terms of the like the distance that light travels so I can''t
  remember exactly how we used to do c seconds um but it was something to do with
  like the period perod of a pendulum of a given length um and we we sense we now
  we now measure seconds in terms of the oscillation of a cesium atom because it''s
  a some sort of quantum thing it''s they oscillate at at a very regular interval
  and then we measure meters by the distance that light travels in so many oscillations
  of a cesium atom and that measurement was basically designed as the the time it
  takes for light to travel this distance um so that we could be more precise with
  our more modern uh measurements and whatnot um yeah and then these yeah so so these
  are the only base units that we have to do proper science so if you''re ever doing
  a scientific study or measurement or you have to report numbers you''re not allowed
  to use inches you have to use meters you can you can choose to use things like centimeters
  or millimeters or kilometers or whatever unit whatever number of zeros Mak sense
  for your measurement but you''re not allowed to use inches or feet or and if you''re
  measuring mass you''re not allowed to use pounds you have to use kilograms uh and
  if you are when I say allowed I mean like the scientific Community has Creed so
  like if you''re publishing a paper in a scientific journal um they should if you
  were if you present stuff with your numbers and things like feet and pounds they
  should send it back to you and say convert these to SI units and send it back and
  if they don''t then I would consider that to be a failure of the peer review process
  which is its own conversation there um now a thing to notice about this rather rather
  tur list of possible units is why is just asking yourself like why is it so constrained
  why are these the numbers that we have um and the answer is it it it if you sort
  of drill down into it like these are what we consider to be like the short list
  of measurable things everything that we can measure with our basic sort of tools
  um can boil down to either these basic quantities or derive more complicated combinations
  of these con of these quantities so you have time you have spatial extent you have
  mass you have we have electrical current Kelvin temperature is just uh Kelvin is
  just celus where zero is at Absolute Zero um mole is some countable amount and then
  Candela is light um so ear when we were talking about like transduction and things
  like that um in terms of environmental energies and things that the nervous system
  wants to take in in order for us to perceive something about the world this is sort
  of a roundabout way of thinking about like if you''re measure if you''re thinking
  about a sensory system and you''re thinking about the energy that it absorbs to
  give you a empirical estimate about what''s in the world you can think about how
  that you know how does sight how does sound how does touch how does taste boil down
  to these basic units you will also quickly discover that if you''re trying to do
  anything of Interest you''re going to these are not really going to cut it for you
  uh for very long because there''s just not much yeah you''re going to have to eventually
  come up with new units to measure more interesting things um for example if you
  want to measure something like velocity you want to measure how fast something is
  moving through the world you can''t do it with these alone but you can do it by
  starting to squish some of them together so with velocity we can measure that in
  terms of meters second by look which is the units are just met per second is the
  same as meters divided by second so every time there is a second every time a second
  passes you move this many meters that''s that''s your velocity and so the the SI
  units for velocity are meters per second unless you''re going very slow in which
  case you might use millimeters per second or if you''re going very fast you might
  want to use kilometers per second but it''s still going to boil down to these SI
  units there um and this is where it''s going to start getting towards Neuroscience
  this is we''re we''re rapidly approaching the topic of this course which I probably
  should have sort of specified beforehand um so one of the main sort of Nod nodules
  in the in that interest space of that of the class is biomechanics sort of you a
  lot of yall asked about biomechanics like what does that mean and you know whatever
  whatever conversations you had with the biomechanics is roughly speaking good oldfashioned
  Newtonian physics except as it applies to a wobbly biological system typically one
  that has something like a mus like a muscular skeletal system um and we will soon
  be sort of getting to the biomechanics and and next week the data that we''re going
  to be collecting in class is going to involve things like the it''s going to involve
  standing balance so things like like look at this wacky thing that I''m doing with
  my body I''m carrying the majority of my mass some 100 kilograms of salty meat like
  a meter and a half above the ground which is a really insane thing to do and I can
  hold I can even go onto one foot and now that''s this is a lot of mass being supported
  on a couple of Wiggly joints some variable stiffness electric strings called muscles
  and a base of support that''s like this big if I ever come in if I came in here
  with like 200 kg of Steel and I put it on something that was that small and raise
  it Up This Tall that would be a very dangerous thing to do but it''s something that
  we do with our bodies a healthy person will do it a million times per year so if
  you uh 10,000 steps a day let say 20,000 steps a day because you''re grads you talk
  you walk a lot uh 20,000 time 365 is approaching a million steps per day and so
  that is a period of time where your the big mass of your body is being supported
  above the ground because your nervous system is electrifying and firing your muscles
  in the right way at the appropriate intervals to keep you from falling over and
  so this is one of those things that we just we don''t really think about it but
  once you start thinking about it there''s a lot going on there and my particular
  approach to studying this stuff involves kind of like boiling it down to those first
  principles measuring the behavior in those basic units of geometry and physics and
  then trying to figure out what we can infer about the UN the unmeasurable parts
  of that system which is like the neural firings based off of the physics and geometry
  of the measurable components which is like where is my body at any given point in
  space so this type of thing yeah and so when we talk about things like biomechanics
  we''re talking about like the physics of of bi physics as applied to organisms in
  biology um the units we''re going to start talking about are in terms of you know
  position where am I in space velocity how am I moving in space and then we start
  getting into sort of fancier terms like force like what forces am I applying to
  the world like if I''m if I''m standing right here and I push with my toes I will
  tilt backwards um if I''m if I push off the table I''ll go that way so I''m applying
  forces into the world and because I''m I am a massive object putting Force into
  the world that will cause me to move um the units for force are Newtons which is
  kilograms time meters times uh seconds squared uh so that''s kilogram m/s squar
  so if you remember we had acceleration so we had position is in meters velocity
  is in meters per second uh how many what did your position change how many meter
  in in one second how many meters did you change velocity uh sorry acceleration is
  meters per second per second so you''re you''re speeding up uh how how much faster
  did you are you going a second from now versus right now that''s acceleration um
  and then if we sort of jump ahead to sort of Newton''s Laws uh Newton''s Laws of
  Motion you you know Force equals masstimes acceleration we''ve all heard that one
  before um I''m I''ll leave this as an exercise to the reader I guess uh if you sit
  down and if you do Force equals mass times acceleration if you do Mass which is
  in kilograms time acceleration which is meters per second squar you will get this
  unit and we call that unit Newtons um and then if we sort of apply a force over
  a given distance we have something we call work um work is just force applied over
  distance that gives you kilograms time meters squared times second squared and that
  gives and that is a we call that a jewel uh which is a unit of energy energy is
  the ability to do work EG the thing that is conserved and we''re talking about the
  conservation of energy uh so if you other famous equation eal MC s if you do that
  units out you will you will find that energy in that equation is You Know M E equals
  m c s so energy equals mass in kilogram time C which is the speed of light in meters
  per second squared you''ll wind up with one of these things um so just a good example
  of how that stuff boils down to SI units and once you''ve gotten to energy we now
  have now we''re touching this sort of this classic physics things of the conservation
  of energy and this winds up being a very good like this is a phys a law of physics
  that if you''re observing a system that''s a closed system energy is neither created
  nor destroyed it just changes form and that''s a really strong belief that that
  I have that we have physics has been very uh physics has been very adamant that
  conservation of energy is generally true and so that winds up being a very strong
  assumption that I can use as a scientist to try to make sense of the wacky data
  that we''re going to be measuring uh when we start actually looking at the weird
  goopy complexity of a person moving through space um that doesn''t make sense it
  might later or it might not we''ll find out as a group uh yeah normalized units
  too we can talk about [Music] um yeah so I won''t say too much about this I''ll
  just say it in passing but uh even though there are things even though like SI units
  you use SI units for things like kill for things like Mass if you''re doing something
  like measuring a person moving through space and you measuring like like this is
  me walking around and this is me like pushing off the ground and um second uh you
  know putting Force into the ground stuff like that um it might stop it might like
  measuring everything in terms of kilogram starts to get annoying because it''s like
  oh I''m 100 kilograms or whatever I''ve said I think I said 200 but it''s not not
  that um uh because we''re thinking about the we''re we''re studying a a person so
  we can make our math and our lives much easier by just dividing all of our our Mass
  measurement by my personal body weight like how much my Mass is in kilograms and
  so then we''re no longer using things like kilograms everywhere we''re now talking
  about things like body masses body weights or whatever um weight is actually a measure
  of uh force not mass but um and so we can do we basically so that we would say we
  would normalize mass by the participants by the subject by the person''s body mass
  so now we have a one when looking at our units we get we get the number one which
  is a very convenient unit because you can kind of it makes the math sort of work
  out easier um okay so now we have okay so we''re going to now we''re we''re we''re
  inching our way towards a human and we this we''re we''re the conception of human
  as as one of these approximations not one of these this is too complicated let''s
  we''re going to stick with this um and by getting we''ve gotten through all that
  spatial stuff all that measurement stuff all that unit stuff and now we can start
  thinking in terms of of physics now physics is just it''s the sort of the math of
  the description of how objects move through the world and there''s all sorts of
  different layers of physics and the layer that I tend to hang out in is what''s
  called classical mechanics where classical mechanics is B basically Newton''s three
  laws as they apply to simple sort of mechanical objects so it''s basically like
  Cannonball physics um now this is also a fun example of like a a philosophy of science
  concept which is that our all everything all of our theories are wrong at any at
  all points at all points in time um so Newton''s Laws came about in I want to say
  like 1700s or something like that uh and he was trying to understand the motion
  of the planets um and so he came up with these simple rules of sort of how mechanics
  tends the works and it was very useful and it explains a lot of the physical world
  it explains a lot of sort of simple objects in the world and you can derive their
  trajectories through space using Newtonian mechanics it and it explains the majority
  of the planetary motions but it doesn''t do a good job of of predicting the movement
  of a planet like Mercury and it was actually so and if and if and even in that day
  they if they applied the Newtonian predictions for Planet trajectories it didn''t
  the uh Mercury''s orbit didn''t line up with the prediction so they actually postulated
  for a long time that there was a another planet between Mercury and Venus that could
  be making sense of the weird anomalies and Mercury''s orbit and that planet was
  called Vulcan which is where that term comes from um eventually time passed and
  such a guy as Einstein came on the picture and sort of started kicking out all these
  wacky ideas around relativity Theory and uh it''s much harder math but if you apply
  th those that theoretical framework to the Motions of the planet and you now account
  for the fact that the that the sun is so massive that it warps SpaceTime and all
  that kind of wacky nonsense now all of a sudden uh Mercury''s orbit starts to make
  sense and you no longer need to posit the existence of some un of some unknown undiscovered
  planet called Vulcan um and so we know from measurements that Newton''s Laws of
  mechanics are not an accurate representation of the physical universe that we inhabit
  we also know that be that in any location that we tend to care about as human beings
  on a planet the accuracy that you get when you use Newton''s Laws is like nine de
  it''s like decimal place like 9 10 decimal places out uh so you start like the difference
  between the prediction of this Ball''s Motion in Newtonian mechanics and the same
  prediction in relativistic mechanics is so far below our ability to measure the
  position it just those numers you only relativity when you start looking at things
  like planets on the scales of you know stars and stuff like that so we still use
  Newtonian Mechanics for almost everything that we do in our daily lives even though
  we know that that is not as accurate as something like relativistic physics and
  there''s a lot to be said there but let''s let''s keep movement um so yeah so Newton''s
  Laws there''s three of them a body the first law is a body in rest or in motion
  tends to stay in rest or in motion so that''s inertia things in motion tend to stay
  in motion unless acted upon by a force the second one arguably my favorite is force
  equals mass times acceleration or if you''re in rotational space it''s torque equals
  moment of inertia times angular acceleration but don''t worry about that um so fals
  ma is a very very useful equation uh basically so if you look at me I am a mass
  uh my Mass is not changing so let''s just Let''s ignore the M of that because it''s
  not doing anything it''s a constant so let''s divide by my body weight and then
  we have Force equals acceleration so I''m not moving I''m not accelerating that
  means that the sum of forces acting on my body has to equals z if it if it if it
  didn''t I would be moving now I''m going to I''m going to so all the pluses and
  the minus have to add up to zero in order for that to to work um and you can see
  if I I like soften my oh let me do this backwards the third the third law is for
  every action there is an equal and opposite reaction you have an action and a reaction
  force so here I am standing look we''re officially doing Neuroscience that''s me
  I''m standing and I''m standing on the ground and I weigh one body mass and I am
  being pulled down by this horrible Planet at a rate of G if you drop me from a c
  from a place up high I would accelerate downward at 9.8 meters per second squared
  let''s call it 10 uh and and that''s that''s always happening at all times um but
  so this Force so so G is 9.8 m/s squared uh so that''s the A and the f equals Ma
  and I''m move and I''m so I''m being pulled down by that amount but I''m not moving
  so the so there must be something else pushing back with exactly the same force
  and that''s that''s our good friend the ground the ground is a very useful object
  it allows us to complete most of our goals and as I am pushing this is the action
  I am pushing into the ground with mass times Gravity Force and the ground is dutifully
  pushing back with exactly negative masstimes Gravity Force great if I ever decide
  to break this equation I can push if I like if I decide to push off the ground with
  more than that than than more than gravity is pulling me then I can do such a wacky
  thing is jump so I put Force into the ground it''s more than I weigh I briefly airborne
  and then gravity pulls me back down um and that winds up being important for a lot
  of stuff okay I need to speed up here um okay okay I think I know how this is going
  to go so great so this is our this is your uh preview of high level human movement
  Neuroscience um but we gotta we got to do a little more work before we can get into
  the the meat there let''s go back to thinking about simple simple spheroids um such
  as brightly colored juggling balls um so yeah so when you''re doing empirical studies
  you''re doing empirical measurements you always have to make assumptions that''s
  always going to be a thing that you''re doing you have to make assumptions that
  your senses aren''t lying to you at all times you make assumptions that when you
  read papers that the people who did that study are not actively lying to you and
  falsifying all their data um you have to make assumptions about yeah and every time
  you make an assumption you get a little bit more predictive power um so if I if
  I''m trying to measure my body moving through space I know that this is like a wobbly
  meaty thing and I know that the distance between my elbow and my wrist changes ever
  so slightly because I am made of squishy meat but if I just assume that I''m that
  that that''s just not happening and that I''m actually composed of rigid bodies
  that don''t change length then I get a lot I get a lot my math gets easier because
  now I don''t have to measure the length between these things I only have to meure
  the angles between them um and so those assumptions that we make and wind the only
  the only measurement you can make without making assumptions is that you are having
  a conscious experience at this exact moment and that''s just not very useful um
  so this is where we come back to what I was talking about earlier where this the
  idea of a conservation of energy winds up being one of those very very powerful
  and very very useful assumptions that can really get us a lot of the way towards
  understanding the things that we care about the desiderata of our research goals
  the things that is desired in our research activity um because again looking at
  this object there''s a lot like if if my desire is to understand something like
  standing posture or God forbid Locomotion uh there''s a lot there there there are
  many many aspects of that question that I cannot measure empirically I just don''t
  have the technological capacity to measure the firing in my cerebellum or the stretch
  forces in my muscles I can''t measure that but I can measure things like the sort
  of the stick figure position of my body 33 times per second using something like
  a motion capture system that I built over time in my house um and so by using that
  thing that I can measure in these certain assumptions about conservation of energy
  I can start to have I can start to try to understand like the the what we''ll just
  call the technical term it''s the fidly bits um and this is going to fuz out I think
  in a bit uh that we''ll we''ll sort of like we''ll pick up I get probably around
  here next week um but I''m going to get through it all so that at least it''s at
  least you will have experienced it at least one time um so when you''re thinking
  about when you''re doing sort of a mechanical analysis of a person um you can you
  want to think about what are the forms of energy that are relevant to this task
  that I''m looking at here um and in this part of the class we''re just measuring
  movement the motor control part we''re not looking at perception we''re not looking
  at Vision so we get to ignore things like light and we get to focus on just the
  simple physics of being a massive object in a world that has such things as ground
  and gravity and so the forms of energy that we can really measure and we can really
  care about are mostly potential energy and kinetic energy and there''s a lot of
  forms of potential energy um the most obvious and easy one is gravitational potential
  energy which is the distance so this is the ground we''ll call that the height is
  zero you got to do that doesn''t matter where we are horizontally but it does matter
  where we are vertically and so po potential energy gravitation potential energy
  equals mass gravity height so which again mass is kilogram meters per second squared
  height is again in meters you can do the math and figure out that this the units
  will be Newtons when you do that and so the potential energy is basically a measurement
  of if I had this object and I dropped it the force that it would that if I put like
  a scale underneath that the force that it would put into that scale is this many
  newtons um yeah other forms of potential energy which we''re not really going to
  talk as much about are things like spring potential energy so if like stretchiness
  of a spring also chemical potential energy which is like food and bombs and gasoline
  and stuff like that a lot of the sort of the deeper level biology you''re going
  to start getting into chemical potential energy and that''s when you start things
  seeing things like the ion charges don''t line up so there''s ex that''s you start
  measuring into the colums or whatever that electrical unit is so that''s the potential
  energy is like a mismatch between the way that the world would really prefer to
  be and the way that the world currently is so the low energy state if I wasn''t
  holding this the low energy state of the world would be this on the ground and so
  if I let go then I know how much energy is going to be hit there da da d da um the
  other one to think about is kinetic energy which is the physics of M M so if you
  were to measure yeah so kinetic energy is half kinetic energy 12 met MV squ 1 12
  MV squ at mass is kilograms velocity is meters per second do the math I promise
  you it will turn out to be Newtons because it''s a measure of force and it is the
  amount of force that would be hit like if I were to drop this the instantaneous
  moment before it hits the ground it would be having the an how it would have a certain
  amount of kinetic energy how much kinetic energy would it have it would have exactly
  the same amount of kinetic energy as it had potential energy before I dropped it
  and if you add these things together oh no not do that and yeah and so using that
  type of analysis potential and kinetic energy is where you get things like the parabolic
  Flight of the object through space because as it leaves my hand it has the instantaneous
  moment that it breaks contact with my hand and it''s in Free Flight it has a certain
  amount of kinetic energy and it has the most energy that it''s going to have for
  this entire trajectory uh has maximum kinetic energy minimum potential energy and
  it goes up through space the kinetic energy it slows down as it goes up and it gets
  higher so the potential energy increases until it reaches a point where it''s at
  the Apex and the potential energy is now at the max because it''s as high as it''s
  going to get the kinetic energy is at the minimum because it''s it''s briefly uh
  it briely has zero velocity when it goes from moving up to moving down um and then
  it''s going to come back the other way and when it hits when it gets right the moment
  right the moment right over hit the ground hits my hand again it will have the same
  amount of kinetic energy as it had when it started so you get this nice sort of
  trade-off there so this is a much so when I talked about things like transduction
  for for vision or for action or for somata sensation or things like that we''re
  talking about a transfer of energy from one form for light let''s say Candelas into
  another form which is a pattern of neural activity measured by voltages and electron
  ion mismatches and stuff like that um there''s there''s so much that''s not measurable
  in that conversion um but physics would have us believe that if you could tally
  up every ion and every sort of quantum of of energy the math of that conversion
  would match would would work out as perfectly as The Cannonball physics of simple
  ballistic motion does um because this transition from kinetic potential energy is
  also transduction that is also a transfer of energy from one form to another um
  yeah uh we''re ignoring if I was a bird I could flap my wings and push against air
  sufficiently to get a reaction force to sort of counteract gravity um if I if this
  was a pogo stick and I sort of compressed it and then threw it then it hit then
  it would have a bunch of spring potential energy that when it hit the ground it
  might bounce additionally but if we assume the simple rigid body uh physics then
  that kinetic and potential energy is going to sort of yeah have this nice conservative
  tradeoff this will become important later um so now we get to my favorite part um
  which I will will only be just a little taster uh and then we will talk at about
  this at length next time and that''s the concept of the center of mass um the center
  of mass is a term in physics you probably heard it in some it comes up a lot in
  like uh you know Sports and especially anything related like gymnastics and balance
  stuff like that you hear people talk about the center of mass as um like the position
  of your body um run out of time here I''ll just do it so the center of mass is um
  the average position of all of the oops excuse me is the average position of all
  of the objects of all the components of the larger object so if I were to take this
  tube and cut it up into 1 cm long sections and then took the position of those sections
  relative to a zero point or any zero point and took the average of all of them it
  would be in the middle of the thing and that is the center of mass and it turns
  out that when you''re supporting something above the ground you do it by supporting
  the center of mass of the thing so if I were to hold it over here then the center
  of mass would fall and it wouldn''t stay on my hand um if I were to put a weight
  so these are like ankle weights they look like they''re from like the ''90s I also
  found them on the street near my house there''s like a place for people in the neighborhood
  just like put sort of like garbage before like before it goes away um and I found
  these and they''re sort of useful for this so by putting this it weighs like a pound
  I think so like half a kilogram um and so now before it was on here this thing was
  of uniform density so the center of mass was in the middle of it now it''s not of
  uniform density so the center of mass shifts to here now this is the center of mass
  of the system so now when I want to support the system I have to take into account
  the shift and density of all the things that are a part of that system um and so
  if we really wanted to we could determine how much this thing weighs in units of
  stick by measuring the distance between this balance point and the center of the
  stick which is where we would balance it on if it it was symmetrically oriented
  like that um I don''t want to but we could uh and that concept of balance as the
  relationship between the center of mass and the base of support is something we''re
  going to talk about a lot uh yeah but um but yeah so similarly so we talked a little
  bit about um the concept of like reductionist approaches to Scientific studies which
  is like trying to trying to nail down like that the problem I said before like I''m
  I want to measure this thing that I care about but I don''t have the ability to
  measure all the parts of it with the precis that I need to do that one approach
  to to dealing with that problem is to narrow your focus and rather than trying to
  explain the entire complexity of the thing that''s moving which is not available
  for empirical measurement you can look at a smaller and smaller and smaller piece
  of it um and so instead of looking at the whole body you might sort of look at just
  the movement of like a single joint or something like that or the single arm or
  something like that um and keep that same sort of full level of fidelity of still
  thinking about this weird shape in you in terms of like a thing that has all of
  these joint angles that can Define it its position at a given point in time um but
  even for something like this which is a a massive simplification of of of a human
  this is still a pretty complex object physically speaking like there''s still a
  lot of joints that can vary and you have as many degrees of freedom as you have
  joints times two or three depending on how you count so Define the position the
  the ident the position of this kinematic object in space requires a lot of different
  numbers and that''s going to be sort of hard to deal with um the other approach
  is to just simplify down the system that you''re looking at into a a massive oversimplification
  um and and try to do that in such a way that still allows you to say things about
  the system as a whole so like and that''s basically what the idea of the center
  of mass is so rather than thinking about this whole complex thing with all the joints
  and all the muscles and all the the blood pumping and all the sort of the the biological
  realities going on there um we can instead uh condense it down [Music] into a simplified
  system so this is something I made some years ago um and this is just showing a
  guy doing a handstands a French parkour Vista named simonster and the X here is
  his full body Center of mass which is measured as the weighted sum of each of these
  body segments so the segment of the forearm the the upper arm the head the chest
  the legs you take the average of all those positions uh weighted by the mass of
  that object so like the forearm weighs a lot less than the legs for example this
  is the position that you get and then if you measure the limits of the base of support
  here um as the the distance between the tips of his fingers to the heel of his hand
  which those are the places where you can put Force into the ground the center of
  mass always stays within that space so you can know that even though there''s a
  lot going on here biologically from a physics perspective that you can Define the
  task of balance using these sort of very hyper simplified models of the body which
  take the entire complexity of a human person and boil it down to a singular Point
  Mass which in this case is in two Dimensions but it could be in three dimensions
  and we have now um simplified the world down to a place that starts to feel more
  tractable uh I can handle this many numbers I can''t I can kind of handle this many
  numbers but not really um but this is a place where uh if you by the way in on the
  list on the the notes if you click on on this where is it uh Co gifts it goes to
  a link to a bunch of those types of animations that I made we''ll talk about them
  more later um oh do that there we go um yeah and so so you can reduce down this
  complex object of a human down to a singular Point Mass and physics has told us
  I I believe it''s like the finite element theorem or something like that but I''m
  not really 100% sure on that it''s basically says that things that you say about
  the center of mass of a system are true to some extent of the other object of all
  the objects in that system so talking about the center of mass of that person um
  is a valid approximation of what the full picture would be if if I was measuring
  every single sort of cube of his body you know at at the same time um you''re obviously
  going to be losing a lot of of of information so if I''m only thinking about the
  suar this one''s another wacky guy so if I''m boiling down this guy''s entire body
  to this singular Mass I can no longer really say things about the joint angles or
  the forces at the elbow stuff like that but I can determine whether or not he''s
  in a stable regime or an unstable regime and I can measure things like what''s happening
  at the physics level when he shifts hand from one position to the other and I can
  use this belief about the physics of his body to start trying to infer what some
  of these Wiggles and movements actually mean so like when it why like without this
  sort of center of mass analysis it might be hard to explain why his arm is out here
  it might they might not have much to say about that but when you''re thinking about
  it like this it becomes very easy like he sticks his arm out so that his Center
  like if I move my arm and leg like this the average of them keeps my body over my
  foot um and I I can do this but I can''t I can''t do that it''s anyway you''ll figure
  it out um I''ll show you visual representations of this once you actually get the
  the numbers next week um right and then yeah uh and you might ask the question of
  how do we do these measurements how do we get these numbers and soort how do I know
  where to draw the segment Center of mass for his torso versus how like what percentage
  of a body weight is a forearm like how do you get those numbers uh well it turns
  out we just we have these lookup tables this is called anthropometry um yeah and
  these are just this this is statistics Oh wrong way ah um right um so these particular
  lookup tables come from a guy named David winter uh this is copied from a textbook
  of his from like 1995 or something like that and it shows these measurements of
  the shoulder is 0.129 H where H is the body height and so he and then these are
  the lookup table for these segments so the forearm is defined as the dist as the
  the space between the elbow axis in theer styloid I guess is here uh it''s 028 of
  an M which is a body mass and the center of mass is4 36% of the wave from the the
  proximal joint which is the one towards the middle towards the distal joint which
  is the one that''s farther away so if you add these two numbers up they add equal
  one um so you kind of you can use these numbers to to calculate these values and
  these numbers were basically statistics of they chopped up a bunch of dead people
  in Meed um it was like Air Force research I believe and there''s a lot of so and
  they were they were all like older men um so there are other newer tables now that
  have people of different ages and people you know different genders and things like
  that in the end it doesn''t super matter for a lot of like the numbers are slightly
  different you know women have a lower Center of mass then you know blah blah blah
  um but for the levels of analysis that we tend to be looking at in terms of like
  this type of physics or like you know where your where your body mass is going when
  you''re moving your your feet around the distances the the differences between those
  estimates for the different sort of categories of human um are just not they''re
  below the level of precision that we have for our measurements for most cases so
  I tend to just keep using these because you know it''s available and I don''t have
  to if you if you look up paper on anthropometry tables you''ll find all sorts of
  new stuff about oh we chopped up a bunch of athletic people and non-athletic people
  and older people and younger people and da da da d da um and and great good job
  for them um yeah okay pendul pendul are my favorite thing we''ll talk about them
  next week uh balance will''ll talk about and then this is color there we go um and
  then someday we''ll also talk about projective geometry which is the same which
  this is this is what cameras and vision and stuff is and they are it''s the same
  math except this one is about light instead of physics but it''s the same kind of
  idea you project stuff and this whole thing um and then eyeballs and stuff like
  that so okay that was a lot uh hope you got something out of it um it will not be
  on the test there is no test uh it''s just it''s much more try to internalize it
  try to conceptualize it try to think more about the concepts than the details um
  and think it''s it''s it''s better to think about like how would you recreate this
  story when you''re telling it to someone else than it is to remember anything specific
  about what I said um because notice a lot of it was just kind of like reconstructed
  from first principles and so it''s useful to be able to do that so try to tell the
  story to someone else that you know later and then when you hit Parts it''s like
  wait why how did you get from there to there think about it ask those questions
  okay um cool uh thank you we''ll talk more about this next week and we''ll talk
  about pendula which is the best pendulums they''re my favorite we''ll talk all about
  it okay hie'

  text: okay hello hello hi thank you welcome to whatever this is um so yeah let's
    Okay so let's do the standard check-in thing so I am recording this and we'll
    be posting it online um a couple people so people have sort of sporadically been
    contacting me and saying like hey I'm sick I'm not going to make it to class hey
    I'm not going to make the deadline that St of stuff if you're sick straight up
    don't come to class like we had a whole ass pandemic so like please let us learn
    that lesson as a culture um you don't need to check with me it's totally fine
    I trust you uh also the deadlines are all kind of made up so like you know I put
    them on there in the sense of like I really hope everyone has it done by this
    point because I like I use the data from that for each stage um but they're all
    available until the end of the semester so with the exception of the poster thing
    there's a couple like hard deadlines for that that like you know you have to get
    it to the printer on time and stuff like that um everything else just kind of
    like just get it done as soon as you can which I understand is a dangerous thing
    to say to some people but um I I trust you I believe in you just check all the
    boxes before the end of the semester we'll be good to go um so quick check in
    on schedules and stuff what did we do last Wednesday can you remind me did I talk
    or did the group thing group thing yeah group thing group thing was good group
    thing uh uh with bot yeah great uh and then we had something that was due and
    today today what fun we're going to be talking about a lecture that I've given
    like a bunch of times and I always enjoy giving it and it's going to be intro
    to measurement and the concepts and what kns there to pertaining um and check
    this out look what you get to do when you're in charge no assignment great feel
    like we've been doing we've been doing enough you guys are doing great um okay
    uh is this the right day this is the right day cool um oh so so today's lecture
    is going to be about like measurement units and things like that sort of like
    hopefully more it's got a lot of props and visual aids and whatnot um and I want
    to do it now because on Wednesday I think we can do a free moap inclass recording
    uh which will be our first relationship with like sort of more classical data
    like I I keep referring to like this the text stuff

  text: that you're punching into the server as data and it is Data um but it's kind
    of like you know if you asked me three years ago if that was Data I'd be like
    yeah I guess technically but it's only since like AI came online that I think
    of that as data um uh freeo cap is a motion capture sort of you know free open
    source thing that I've been building for the past half decade or so of My Life
    um and it's specifically designed to sort of like make good class demos and things
    like that so we're going to be recording some dat and then talking about it in
    the Contex of the kind of Concepts we're going to go over today um so hopefully
    we can get some of that in today um let's see anything else to catch up on um
    just for completeness I will remind everybody although I didn't nothing special
    has happened with this this round but the server so in in the server in the links
    and resources find the server scrape checkpoint and and there is the same sort
    of at the bottom 127 so that's the server scraped and analyzed as of this morning
    um so same thing download it unzip it if you don't know what unzipping is it's
    the thing where you double click in and it makes a folder next door um that you
    can open like a regular thing um so you can search for your name in there I'm
    going to be refactoring the way that we do the student profile building thing
    so like your individual profiles are going to change probably next week um just
    because I'm going to change theof the code and prompts that make it um I realized
    that it would probably give you a much more precise measurement of who what you're
    interested in if I didn't use everything you put in the server for the profile
    but just use the assignment chats so the ones from your intro and the poster presentation
    thing um and I'm also you know in the process I might also set something up that
    you can sort of in a given chat you can like ask the bot to remember you and it
    will pull that history into the conversation and that will sort of you don't have
    to start every conversation from scratch type of thing um uh yeah also by just
    by way of reminding um sort of the word helping you guys learn the paths and whatnot
    um here we are on the server same channel up here links and resources and course
    Repository click on that and something pops up I don't know why two things pop
    up um this is the course repository this is the sort of the most up to-date oh
    actually I forgot to do this last time update syllabus syllabus commit in sync

  text: all right same thing on fireof Fox and you see it says update syllabus that
    was the thing I just pushed up and now the code is not the code the text is uh
    which is you know code that code for primates um and that's updated this is called
    a this is GitHub that's kind of what GitHub does it's a Version Control software
    it's kind of like track changes but um more sophisticated um pretty much every
    piece of software you've ever used in your life has used git at some level um
    and I'm kind of like hijacking it to do text based stuff um so yeah and also just
    to be clear just for fun um so this site is basically as if it was a folder the
    read me here is the thing that's posted down there uh this is what it looks like
    formatted that's what it looks like raw this is a honest measurement and record
    of exactly what my primate body did to a keyboard at some point in time so it
    is a truth preserving record of my thoughts in a way that a docx file or a Google
    Drive Link sort of will never be so shout out to markdown in raw text formats
    okay right so on this page go back to the front page hey uh there we go in the
    lectures folder in 20 25127 intro to measurement and the top one is called intro
    to measurement and here we go it's the what's it called the notes for my notes
    for the lecture that we're about to give and with that I'm going to switch away
    from the GitHub and go to my local version just because I want to uh local meaning
    on this machine not on the internet some other servers machine GitHub is own by
    Microsoft so technically that state data is hosted on Microsoft um this is on
    my computer okay cool this is a brief summary we'll see how much we get through
    I think we'll get through all of it so here we are in this class extensively to
    teach y'all what science is what science looks like how you might ever do

  text: such a wacky thing as to attempt to know the world and do Empirical research
    within it um and there's a lot of things that get taken for granted by when you
    sort of just live as a human person in a world um that you start to find yourself
    needing to get much more specific about once you actually start to trying start
    trying to get into the business of knowledge generation so the idea as a scientist
    is that you are attempting to create new knowledge for humankind um which is a
    very difficult thing to do it's hard to know stuff um and there's certain rules
    for how to do that um so a lot of what we talk about in The Sciences the empirical
    Sciences is based on the concept of empirical measurement so um there are many
    ways to know things um the scientific method and empirical method is one way to
    know the world it's a very powerful way to know the world because it allows you
    to do things like make predictions about the future build tools uh heal people
    when they're sick things like that um and everything is sort of in that sort of
    conception of knowledge is is based on at some level an empirical measurement
    uh of the world where yeah empirical measurement is we're going to talk a little
    about what that means but BAS basically it's the idea that you have done yeah
    you've done some kind of a measurement and that's what that term measurement is
    one of those kind of like one of those terms that gets taken for granted but we'll
    talk a little bit about what that means um so the most important thing to sort
    of I don't about the most but one of the most one of the very important things
    to think about when you're thinking about Empirical research and the concept of
    measurement is that everything that you're doing everything that you're building
    on has to be built relative to something else so when you're trying to if you're
    trying like if you're uh trying to generate new knowledge that knowledge that
    is going to be sort of based on other things like I used the term earlier of Truth
    preserving a very important term in sort of philosophy of science um because that
    is the concept of being able to build from one thing that you know another thing
    that you might know and everything that you think you know about the world if
    you sort of dig into it is going to be based off some sort of background of well
    I think this because I think because I learn that because I believe this because
    of all that kind of stuff um so it's helpful when you're sort of trying to learn
    the concepts of measurement to try to recreate those epistemological chains where
    epistemology is the study of knowledge um and try to ask yourself sort of where
    these things connect to um if I were to redo this which I will some time I probably
    would have put this one

  text: up top so where the most important thing is that skepticism is the basis of
    scientific reality which is the other concept where skepticism is the idea long
    story short of you have to you have to have reasons to believe the things that
    you believe um you're not allowed to just believe things for no reason um and
    everything that you sort of that you consider has to be kind of you know you have
    to look directly at it and try to boil down sort of what that is connected to
    um so given that it is reasonable to ask about Origins um and the sort of philosophical
    the the classical philosophical Bedrock of belief uh we tend to ascribe to this
    dude de cart who was operating in like the 1500s you've heard of his cartisian
    coordinates and other various things which we'll talk about in various points
    in time um but he has quot is sort of trying to do this philosophical game of
    trying to understand what his knowledge of the world is based off of and came
    across this wonderful little phrase called kogito Eros which means I think therefore
    I am which is basically a fancy way of saying that if you really drill down to
    it the only thing that you can actually truly know and believe without reference
    to some other sort of piece of knowledge is that you are having a conscious experience
    right now in this very moment you are having a qualitative State you are thinking
    and be and nothing in the concept of the universe could ever fake the experience
    of having a conscious experience in this exact moment now your memories of what
    you did yesterday that could be fake you could have done Heist hallucinogenics
    you could have had some someone could be poking at your brain that could all be
    fake your perception of the world around you that could be fake I think I think
    there's a cup out there but I could wearing some sort of crazy VR helmet it could
    be like floating in goop in The Matrix and so all of these other things that we
    want to believe um are all in some way shape and form um subjects of skepticism
    you you could deny you could doubt um that the the veracity of anything else besides
    that Central nugget of I am having a conscious experience right now in this moment
    now if you only want to live with that sort of nihilistic belief you were left
    with a rather un uninteresting philosophical position called solipsism which is
    the belief that you are the only person that exists and everything else around
    you was fake and all other people you see are just Illusions um that is technically
    I believe the only truly defensible philosophical position it's also not useful
    or helpful or particularly interesting um because we we ALS because if you're
    willing to accept other gradients of belief and gradients of Truth into your life

  text: build what feels like knowledge about the real world um as long as you're
    willing to have things like you're you're willing to have things like trust in
    things like memory and if you're willing to sort of smush together all your memory
    and then believe such thing as statistics you can actually do quite a lot with
    that because yes I can doubt I like I can doubt that there's a cup in front of
    me right now but if I keep looking and it keeps happening and I keep moving and
    it has the sort of like geometrically reasonable deformations and then I reach
    out and then I have a cup in my hand and then I put it to my mouth and I get liquid
    at a certain point the accumulation of those sensory experiences starts to really
    resemble something like knowledge that I might have about the real world like
    it might it it starts to become increasingly likely that there is in fact something
    resembling a cup in what in somewhere outside of my conscious experience um and
    which is great because that's what allows us to sort of we we match each other
    in this universe on the basis of our shared memories and statistics and luckily
    that doesn't really it's not really that hard to do but it is sort of troubling
    to think too closely about so from the epistemological point of view we're going
    to base our knowledge on sort of the awareness that we exist which is good and
    then I really hate to say it but the only but on the other the other thing we
    have is memory and statistics not a lot but we can work from there um now with
    that I'm going to shift away from uh that sort of philosophical epistemological
    kind of like floofy exist Central crisis philosophy 101 type of space and shift
    back into the more like rigidly sort of imp Al grounded world of direct empirical
    measurements but we're going to have a similar game to be played there where when
    we think about something like measurement um we still have to base that measurement
    on something so let's talk about let's talk about measuring things and let's start
    I think simply simply enough with a really basic measurement called distance spatial
    distance um this lecture has a lot of uh props and visual aids all made roughly
    speaking out of garbage that I found outside um this is a stick that is kind enough
    to be roughly a meter long um and also can be screwed apart it was actually this
    like the stem of a lamp that I found and I didn't wind up liking the lamp but
    then I realized that if I

  text: pulled it apart then I could stop having to pull a meter long broom stick
    onto campus once oh once a semester so so yeah you need to find one that I can
    see hiking stick could probably do well here okay so this is this is a stick this
    has let's say such a thing as measurement as a as a length so if you wanted to
    measure things in the world you could use something like this let's pretend that
    this is one meter long even though it's actually slightly longer than that let's
    pretend like it's a meter and we wanted to measure something so let's see thisle
    brought colors today so we'll see how that goes for us uh RGB R green we start
    with black I guess so if we're trying to measure the length of things let's say
    we're trying to measure the length of the room or how tall you are how tall this
    thing is whatever um we're going to want to eventually re repres you know write
    these num so we're going to have some sort of a measurement tool like this or
    a you know what's it called tape measure something like that and we're going to
    make some measurements and then we're going to write them down um but when we
    write them down we're going to be we're writing down a number of some kind uh
    so and let's sort of skip a couple steps to then get to the place where we've
    written down a bunch of numbers now we want to represent them sort of to communicate
    we've done a scientific study on how long various things are and we want to present
    this research to our conspecifics and colleagues so you have to write them down
    so we have various ways of measuring things like space and time um and we're going
    to start with space and then we're going to eventually get to time which won't
    take which is actually not worry about it um so the first thing you might want
    to in measuring things you have things like Dimensions you have one dimensional
    two dimensional three dimensional High dimensional we'll talk about these things
    in a second um and in all these cases it's going to start with something resembling
    An Origin so this is the origin it is the it is a zero dimensional object um it
    contains no real information other than it exists right this is an or this is
    a point that doesn't exist this is a point that does exists so this point conveys
    the information hello yes I exist and not really that much else not particularly
    useful scientifically but very important when you're trying to figure out if I
    come to you and I say oh hey that thing is three and a half sticks long that is
    implicitly relative to something which is zero sticks long which is something
    that doesn't which has no extent

  text: so Zero Dimensional gr great good job so now let's think about this Dimension
    and let's call it X because that's traditionally how we do it and this is now
    a one dimensional object so let's say this is infinitely long and we've measured
    this is one stick long so this stick is there so there you go so one one one stick
    long and then I can measure two sticks three sticks Etc that's way better so now
    if I'm going around measuring things I can keep track of the length of the thing
    but again this is not particularly exciting this is there's there's not really
    a point of drawing that you just write down the number you don't gain anything
    by looking at that number relative to zero other than just the knowledge of how
    numbers work so so that's we're going to call that X we're also going to call
    that length great so now we want to measure such so and that's good for measuring
    things like string or distances from here to your house or height of a person
    but now we want to go around we want to measure different things we're still doing
    stuff in we're still measuring length and distances and now we're going to split
    and have a second dimension that we'll call Y we'll also call that height and
    it uses the same unit so you can still be one stick tall you can be two sticks
    tall things like that and so now you can measure things like boards and desks
    and floors and if you measure something in it's two units long and then one unit
    tall then that's a point in that space and that is a two-dimensional Point two-dimensional
    meaning it's got two numbers you have to use to define it in the robotics world
    someday like we're going to I know this is basic we will be ramping up from here
    um but another way to think about this is it's two degrees of freedom meaning
    that if you want to know the area of something uh you need to know two numbers
    to be able to Define that entirely you need length you need width and you could
    do that in various other ways but this is a two dimensional number um so now you
    want to measure thing you want to keep going so you want to keep measuring something
    in a higher dimensional space so you've got length you've got area area is length
    times width or something like that and so now you want to also measure volume
    and with that I have run out of dimensions on the board I can no longer so this

  text: 'accurate one: one representation of the two-dimensional Point XY if I want
    to make a three-dimensional space I no longer have enough dimensions on this board
    because this board is a two-dimensional object so we can fake it and do this kind
    of like right angle thing let''s call this guy back here Z and think about how
    do we do this so we go so one two and then one two three so so this is XZ and
    then we can also pain that up that''s a little screwy but it''s fine you get it
    x y z great this is a three dimensional Point we''ve done it that''s great um
    so this is how you can measure if you''re trying to categorize objects according
    to their volume you need three degrees of freedom you need three numbers to Define
    that volume specifically and you can represent that spatially in this nice sort
    of three-dimensional grid here um now I don''t want to belabor this point too
    much because it will we''ll sort of get there but so this is three dimensions
    traditionally if you ever if you''re going to touch engineering this is the international
    symbol for threedimensional space x x y z this is the right hand rule um so doing
    it backwards here but it would be was that yeah it''s like this so XY Z XY z um
    this is a left-handed coordinate system it is illegal don''t do this just because
    of the rules um actually there''s more to be said there but we can SK past it
    um and so in three dimensions is how many we have in this in in space in three
    dimensional space in humans we are super good at a lot of spatial estimates and
    we really are very good at making things making um very quick calculations of
    things like the cup is is is in front of the bottle the cup is near the edge of
    the table those kind of spatial um what''s the word computations are very easy
    for us now there''s nothing special about three dimensions except for that that''s
    how many you need to define space and time but you can keep going with these numbers
    if you''re trying to define something that requires more than three numbers to
    Define um and again I don''t want to blab this point too much but I I will say
    that it has to do with Pythagorean theorem and like how you measure things like
    distance um because in one dimension the distance from a point to the to the origin
    is trivially'

    TK of a + b a s plus bqu whatever so this is how you do distance you've all seen
    this I'm sure at various points in your high school career um this is the the
    particular case of doing Pythagorean theorem for two Dimensions you replace the
    A and B with X and Y and then you have a way to measure distance in a two- dimensional
    space in a one-dimensional space it's very you know the square root of 2 to the
    2 is just two so that's easy to do um in two-dimensional space it's just that
    in three-dimensional space to measure distance you just add a z you just do the
    measure the distance in in 3D space is the square root of x^2 + y^2 plus z^2 and
    then you can just keep going you just there's nothing special about two you can
    add a w you can add a l you can add a I don't know M and just keep going and keep
    and you you lose the ability to plot it in a way that makes sense but you can
    keep doing all the same math that you were doing with three dimensions up to te
    million dimensions and a lot of the AI stuff the way that that works is it is
    it uses that same kind of like spatial math but it's doing it in like very very
    high dimensional spaces which is one of those terms that you keep you hear people
    say things like high dimensional mathematics and it's like oh my God it's so crazy
    it just means that you keep adding numbers to the Pythagorean theorem to measure
    distance and everything else is pretty much the same um I will say too there's
    a lot of we're going to do like General like mathy stuff here um but luckily you
    don't have to do any of the math you just have to understand it which is so much
    easier like because I know that there's a part where I'm sort of I say oh look
    you can have two x y things like that and that like makes some intuitive sense
    um and I just need to promise you that that intuitive gut check of like yeah that
    makes rough sense that's the vast vast vast majority of the things that you actually
    need to know about mathematics like being able to do it on paper helps um the
    guy who touchs the class before this I'm sure would have many things to say about
    what I'm about to say but I firmly believe that being able to do the math on paper
    is just it's an extra layer of understanding on top of the gut check intuitions
    that will get you most of the way towards where you need to go um okay yeah so

  text: cartisian coordinates because ofart because Western science and math likes
    to name things after the people that discover them which is annoying as hell because
    the same people discover so many things that you end up replac using all these
    words all over again it's really obnoxious um but these are called cartisian coordinates
    ostensibly named for C deart who the story is that he was he was like a sickly
    guy and he was like in his bed and was watching a fly crawling on a window and
    realized that he could Define the the fly's position by just looking at the intersection
    point between the fly and these two points on the window sill and then thus made
    some formalisms and then get to name a whole you get to name the concepts of a
    grid after this guy which is annoying but so this cartisian space is typically
    defined by things like it's got straight lines it's got grids it's got squares
    if you go you you know go from two Dimension to three dimension you go from a
    square to a cube things like that you could also Define this type of stuff in
    angular coordinates so I'm if I care about this point in space I could Define
    it using these sort of like straight line you know right right angle projections
    onto these basis Vector axes I could also say that it's you know this far away
    at that angle off of zero so I start by I I start from this sort of you know we'll
    call they call it X and then we go up by this angle which can be degrees or radians
    or whatever you want then we go out by this number R by some distance and we still
    get to the same spot in 2D space and so in and so instead of defining this in
    terms of XY I could also Define it in terms of theta row which row is just like
    the distance row like radius like if this was a circle it would be whatever that's
    not actually what row means but that's fine and so again noticing that this is
    a two-dimensional point two degrees of freedom and I can Define it either in these
    linear XY coordinates or I can Define it in these angular Theta row coordinates
    um because yeah you need two numbers to Define its position and so two numbers
    you get uh once you start if you were to go from so this is a good way to draw
    circles if you go from 2D to 3D they become spheres and the important thing to
    know is that you can always switch back and forth between the linear coordinate
    systems or the spherical coordinate systems the sort of we call these polar coordinates
    versus cartisian coordinates and in practice when you're doing stuff you wind
    up just switching back and forth depending on what you're doing in the math like
    you know if I'm looking at things like joint angles it's really helpful to look
    at it in terms of polar coordinates because there's already got angles in it in
    fact it's even easier than that because we looking at one of these

  text: guys this distance we can just assume never changes so now if I'm looking
    at something like joint angles if I assume that these are rigid bodies and and
    the and the r doesn't change then now I only need one number to Define where it
    is and not two so now I have like one less number to deal with which is great
    because we have too many numbers already that doesn't make sense it might tomorrow
    um let's see I'm going to skip some of this because it gets too we're getting
    pretty mathy pretty quick and this is going to I think make more sense um once
    there's data to look at um but the other thing I guess I'll say just by way of
    completeness um we've we've been talking about ways of measuring space um and
    we also should talk about ways of measuring time you'll hear you hear terms like
    spatio temporal coordinates spatio temporal calibration whatnot remember that's
    an O term so spatio temporal is just spatial SLT temporal it just means you're
    thinking about both space and time and when you're looking at data like this it's
    very common to see in 2D plots want to keep that I don't think I need to keep
    that you see it's really common to see stuff presented like this where this this
    x axis is time and then the y axis is some measurement over time so if we're thinking
    that Y is going to be let's say it's height of my hand off the ground and then
    at Time Zero we're going to measure it and it's one so there we go time zero that's
    me at one and then we're going to wait let's say a second and then we're going
    to measure it let's say it's now one and a half units off the ground I have time
    one doing there if I keep moving up it's going to keep going up and if I wind
    up doing this with my hand then you're going to see dots doing like that and then
    if you connect all those dots and you'll start seeing things like squiggles and
    this is called a Time series because it's a series of measurements over time so
    this is a one-dimensional measurement so I'm just getting height and I'm measuring
    it once per time unit which could be seconds it could be if it's a video like
    this then it's going to be 30 frames per second so it's once every 33 milliseconds
    you know if it's a microphone that records at 44 ktz then it's once every one
    over 44,000 44,000 over one or one over 44,000 seconds um but and that's how you
    get measurements over time and the

  end: 2340.0
  start: 2160.0
  text: important thing to see is you'll often see this presented as connect as a
    straight as a connected line but that's not actually what you're measuring um
    you're only ever going to be measuring something at time intervals you're going
    to be getting one measurement per time interval and so you and so this is what
    your data actually looks like um so if we we have to assume that the movement
    between the measured interval is kind of like cerent like what we expect it to
    be and if we do that then we can connect the lines and get a nice time series
    but if this is one measurement every second and I'm doing this with my hand then
    it actually doesn't look like that under the hood if this if these intervals is
    like one every you know millisecond then we can trust that if it's one every second
    I could just as easily be doing this with my hand and we only get these measurements
    every second so if we interpolate going to be missing a lot of the story um yeah
    so that's time um and I'll just say it just because it's on the thing uh similar
    to space time can also be thought of in in two basic forms linear time sort of
    like a stopwatch and phasic time which is like a clock where it resets to zero
    every every Circle through the available values that will become important in
    the future um blah blah blah if you care about calculus the you know if this is
    the position the slope is the velocity because it's the change in position over
    time if you do that again you get acceleration so velocity is the derivative of
    position acceleration is the derivative of velocity then you go back with the
    integrals that's all the calc you ever need to know as far as I care um okay so
    yeah so that's measurement right and we've been we've been talking about these
    measurement in terms of kind of these like abstract units so you know singular
    sticks whatever doesn't really it doesn't matter like in the same sort of methods
    of plotting will work no matter what it is that you're no matter what units you're
    looking at measuring distance we might use meters if we measuring temperature
    we might use Celsius or kelvin if you're measuring weight you might use kilograms
    um and the same sort of plotting representations will sort of work throughout
    uh now this is a practical thing that you should keep in mind and will come up
    at some point in your future um but when we're talking about the Sciences there's
    rules about the units that we're allowed to use um we're here in a America where
    we have things like imperial units for

  text: like you know feet and inches and stuff like that um which are often kind
    of people talk about them as like these are Bonkers worthless measurements and
    they kind of there's a good argument for that but uh the reality is that a lot
    of our Imperial the Imperial measurements that we tend to use are based on very
    factorable numbers like 12 and 16 because it is easier to do that kind of math
    in like a home environment um whereas metric is B off of T which is very good
    for things like decimal points and precision but kind of harder to cut into even
    so 10 you only get to cut into two and five whereas 12 you get two and five before
    you start needing things like fractions uh 12 you have one two three four six
    and 12 um so if you're imagining that you're like a vendor in some medieval town
    and you have like a bunch of Weights that you have to bring to measure out your
    stuff it's easier to have stuff weighed in terms of 16s and 12 like things like
    baking and stuff like that is easy because it's really easy to cut things in half
    and by Third and stuff like that um but in the Sciences we are required by law
    to use SI units uh by law I mean convention um SI units stands for standard international
    it's a French term that means International standard um and there are a set number
    of of them so here is the Wikipedia page and these are all of the base SI units
    for time we have seconds for meters we have for length we have meters for Mass
    we have kilograms for electrical currents we have ampers for thermodynamic temperature
    we have Kelvin uh for amount of substance we have mole and for luminous intensity
    we have Candela um for the most part around here we're going to be mostly thinking
    about these ones so C second met kilog uh now this is one of the now we get to
    the first visual eight uh now one of the cool things about the metric system is
    that a lot of the parts match up so this is if this was one meter which it's not
    but it let's pretend that it was if this was one meter and this was one liter
    which it claims to be um this is everything we would need to recreate the majority
    of the metric system so the way that it's defin a a liter is a th000 milliliters
    a milliliter is a cubic ctim of water and a cubic centimeter of water weighs one
    gram so if you have a centimeter and you got get a make a cube of that of that
    shape and put water in that Cube and measure the the weight of it um that is defined
    as I don't know if

  text: it's defined as but it's uh that cubic centimeter of water weighs one gram
    if you were then get a thousand of those things together it would weigh one kilogram
    and a thousand of those centimeters cubic centimeters of water ccs would equal
    one liter and one liter uh weighs 1 kilogram so you get it's kind of this fun
    sort of Correspondence there where you get a lot of the if you know what how long
    a meter is and you have standardized water um you can recreate a lot of the units
    that we we wind up using here um yeah yeah and then the meter stick it turns out
    traditionally it was measured as this this stick in France it used to be there
    used to be like an actual stick like this um but I guess it it's like rusted away
    over time so now it just represents some markings on a stone we have since moved
    away from this method of determining a meter and now use it as we measure it in
    terms of the like the distance that light travels so I can't remember exactly
    how we used to do c seconds um but it was something to do with like the period
    perod of a pendulum of a given length um and we we sense we now we now measure
    seconds in terms of the oscillation of a cesium atom because it's a some sort
    of quantum thing it's they oscillate at at a very regular interval and then we
    measure meters by the distance that light travels in so many oscillations of a
    cesium atom and that measurement was basically designed as the the time it takes
    for light to travel this distance um so that we could be more precise with our
    more modern uh measurements and whatnot um yeah and then these yeah so so these
    are the only base units that we have to do proper science so if you're ever doing
    a scientific study or measurement or you have to report numbers you're not allowed
    to use inches you have to use meters you can you can choose to use things like
    centimeters or millimeters or kilometers or whatever unit whatever number of zeros
    Mak sense for your measurement but you're not allowed to use inches or feet or
    and if you're measuring mass you're not allowed to use pounds you have to use
    kilograms uh and if you are when I say allowed I mean like the scientific Community

    feet and pounds they should send it back to you and say convert these to SI units
    and send it back and if they don't then I would consider that to be a failure
    of the peer review process which is its own conversation there um now a thing
    to notice about this rather rather tur list of possible units is why is just asking
    yourself like why is it so constrained why are these the numbers that we have
    um and the answer is it it it if you sort of drill down into it like these are
    what we consider to be like the short list of measurable things everything that
    we can measure with our basic sort of tools um can boil down to either these basic
    quantities or derive more complicated combinations of these con of these quantities
    so you have time you have spatial extent you have mass you have we have electrical
    current Kelvin temperature is just uh Kelvin is just celus where zero is at Absolute
    Zero um mole is some countable amount and then Candela is light um so ear when
    we were talking about like transduction and things like that um in terms of environmental
    energies and things that the nervous system wants to take in in order for us to
    perceive something about the world this is sort of a roundabout way of thinking
    about like if you're measure if you're thinking about a sensory system and you're
    thinking about the energy that it absorbs to give you a empirical estimate about
    what's in the world you can think about how that you know how does sight how does
    sound how does touch how does taste boil down to these basic units you will also
    quickly discover that if you're trying to do anything of Interest you're going
    to these are not really going to cut it for you uh for very long because there's
    just not much yeah you're going to have to eventually come up with new units to
    measure more interesting things um for example if you want to measure something
    like velocity you want to measure how fast something is moving through the world
    you can't do it with these alone but you can do it by starting to squish some
    of them together so with velocity we can measure that in terms of meters second
    by look which is the units are just met per second is the same as meters divided
    by second so every time there is a second every time a second passes you move
    this many meters that's that's your velocity and so the the SI units for velocity
    are meters per second unless you're going very slow in which case you might use
    millimeters per second or if you're going very fast you might want to use kilometers
    per second but it's still going to boil down to these SI units there um and this
    is where it's going to start

    of this course which I probably should have sort of specified beforehand um so
    one of the main sort of Nod nodules in the in that interest space of that of the
    class is biomechanics sort of you a lot of yall asked about biomechanics like
    what does that mean and you know whatever whatever conversations you had with
    the biomechanics is roughly speaking good oldfashioned Newtonian physics except
    as it applies to a wobbly biological system typically one that has something like
    a mus like a muscular skeletal system um and we will soon be sort of getting to
    the biomechanics and and next week the data that we're going to be collecting
    in class is going to involve things like the it's going to involve standing balance
    so things like like look at this wacky thing that I'm doing with my body I'm carrying
    the majority of my mass some 100 kilograms of salty meat like a meter and a half
    above the ground which is a really insane thing to do and I can hold I can even
    go onto one foot and now that's this is a lot of mass being supported on a couple
    of Wiggly joints some variable stiffness electric strings called muscles and a
    base of support that's like this big if I ever come in if I came in here with
    like 200 kg of Steel and I put it on something that was that small and raise it
    Up This Tall that would be a very dangerous thing to do but it's something that
    we do with our bodies a healthy person will do it a million times per year so
    if you uh 10,000 steps a day let say 20,000 steps a day because you're grads you
    talk you walk a lot uh 20,000 time 365 is approaching a million steps per day
    and so that is a period of time where your the big mass of your body is being
    supported above the ground because your nervous system is electrifying and firing
    your muscles in the right way at the appropriate intervals to keep you from falling
    over and so this is one of those things that we just we don't really think about
    it but once you start thinking about it there's a lot going on there and my particular
    approach to studying this stuff involves kind of like boiling it down to those
    first principles measuring the behavior in those basic units of geometry and physics
    and then trying to figure out what we can infer about the UN the unmeasurable
    parts of that system which is like the neural firings based off of the physics
    and geometry of the measurable components which is like where is my body at any
    given point in space so this type of thing yeah and so when we talk about things

    units we're going to start talking about are in terms of you know position where
    am I in space velocity how am I moving in space and then we start getting into
    sort of fancier terms like force like what forces am I applying to the world like
    if I'm if I'm standing right here and I push with my toes I will tilt backwards
    um if I'm if I push off the table I'll go that way so I'm applying forces into
    the world and because I'm I am a massive object putting Force into the world that
    will cause me to move um the units for force are Newtons which is kilograms time
    meters times uh seconds squared uh so that's kilogram m/s squar so if you remember
    we had acceleration so we had position is in meters velocity is in meters per
    second uh how many what did your position change how many meter in in one second
    how many meters did you change velocity uh sorry acceleration is meters per second
    per second so you're you're speeding up uh how how much faster did you are you
    going a second from now versus right now that's acceleration um and then if we
    sort of jump ahead to sort of Newton's Laws uh Newton's Laws of Motion you you
    know Force equals masstimes acceleration we've all heard that one before um I'm
    I'll leave this as an exercise to the reader I guess uh if you sit down and if
    you do Force equals mass times acceleration if you do Mass which is in kilograms
    time acceleration which is meters per second squar you will get this unit and
    we call that unit Newtons um and then if we sort of apply a force over a given
    distance we have something we call work um work is just force applied over distance
    that gives you kilograms time meters squared times second squared and that gives
    and that is a we call that a jewel uh which is a unit of energy energy is the
    ability to do work EG the thing that is conserved and we're talking about the
    conservation of energy uh so if you other famous equation eal MC s if you do that
    units out you will you will find that energy in that equation is You Know M E
    equals m c s so energy equals mass in kilogram time C which is the speed of light

    we start actually looking at the weird goopy complexity of a person moving through
    space um that doesn't make sense it might later or it might not we'll find out
    as a group uh yeah normalized units too we can talk about [Music] um yeah so I
    won't say too much about this I'll just say it in passing but uh even though there
    are things even though like SI units you use SI units for things like kill for
    things like Mass if you're doing something like measuring a person moving through
    space and you measuring like like this is me walking around and this is me like
    pushing off the ground and um second uh you know putting Force into the ground
    stuff like that um it might stop it might like measuring everything in terms of
    kilogram starts to get annoying because it's like oh I'm 100 kilograms or whatever
    I've said I think I said 200 but it's not not that um uh because we're thinking
    about the we're we're studying a a person so we can make our math and our lives
    much easier by just dividing all of our our Mass measurement by my personal body
    weight like how much my Mass is in kilograms and so then we're no longer using
    things like kilograms everywhere we're now talking about things like body masses
    body weights or whatever um weight is actually a measure of uh force not mass
    but um and so we can do we basically so that we would say we would normalize mass
    by the participants by the subject by the person's body mass so now we have a
    one when looking at our units we get we get the number one which is a very convenient
    unit because you can kind of it makes the math sort of work out easier um okay
    so now we have okay so we're going to now we're we're we're inching our way towards
    a human and we this we're we're the conception of human as as one of these approximations
    not one of these this is too complicated let's we're going to stick with this

    all that unit stuff and now we can start thinking in terms of of physics now physics
    is just it's the sort of the math of the description of how objects move through
    the world and there's all sorts of different layers of physics and the layer that
    I tend to hang out in is what's called classical mechanics where classical mechanics
    is B basically Newton's three laws as they apply to simple sort of mechanical
    objects so it's basically like Cannonball physics um now this is also a fun example
    of like a a philosophy of science concept which is that our all everything all
    of our theories are wrong at any at all points at all points in time um so Newton's
    Laws came about in I want to say like 1700s or something like that uh and he was
    trying to understand the motion of the planets um and so he came up with these
    simple rules of sort of how mechanics tends the works and it was very useful and
    it explains a lot of the physical world it explains a lot of sort of simple objects
    in the world and you can derive their trajectories through space using Newtonian
    mechanics it and it explains the majority of the planetary motions but it doesn't
    do a good job of of predicting the movement of a planet like Mercury and it was
    actually so and if and if and even in that day they if they applied the Newtonian
    predictions for Planet trajectories it didn't the uh Mercury's orbit didn't line
    up with the prediction so they actually postulated for a long time that there
    was a another planet between Mercury and Venus that could be making sense of the
    weird anomalies and Mercury's orbit and that planet was called Vulcan which is
    where that term comes from um eventually time passed and such a guy as Einstein
    came on the picture and sort of started kicking out all these wacky ideas around
    relativity Theory and uh it's much harder math but if you apply th those that
    theoretical framework to the Motions of the planet and you now account for the
    fact that the that the sun is so massive that it warps SpaceTime and all that
    kind of wacky nonsense now all of a sudden uh Mercury's orbit starts to make sense
    and you no longer need to posit the existence of some un of some unknown undiscovered
    planet called Vulcan um and so we know from measurements that Newton's Laws of
    mechanics are not an accurate representation of the physical universe that we
    inhabit we also know that be that in any location that we

    you use Newton's Laws is like nine de it's like decimal place like 9 10 decimal
    places out uh so you start like the difference between the prediction of this
    Ball's Motion in Newtonian mechanics and the same prediction in relativistic mechanics
    is so far below our ability to measure the position it just those numers you only
    relativity when you start looking at things like planets on the scales of you
    know stars and stuff like that so we still use Newtonian Mechanics for almost
    everything that we do in our daily lives even though we know that that is not
    as accurate as something like relativistic physics and there's a lot to be said
    there but let's let's keep movement um so yeah so Newton's Laws there's three
    of them a body the first law is a body in rest or in motion tends to stay in rest
    or in motion so that's inertia things in motion tend to stay in motion unless
    acted upon by a force the second one arguably my favorite is force equals mass
    times acceleration or if you're in rotational space it's torque equals moment
    of inertia times angular acceleration but don't worry about that um so fals ma
    is a very very useful equation uh basically so if you look at me I am a mass uh
    my Mass is not changing so let's just Let's ignore the M of that because it's
    not doing anything it's a constant so let's divide by my body weight and then
    we have Force equals acceleration so I'm not moving I'm not accelerating that
    means that the sum of forces acting on my body has to equals z if it if it if
    it didn't I would be moving now I'm going to I'm going to so all the pluses and
    the minus have to add up to zero in order for that to to work um and you can see
    if I I like soften my oh let me do this backwards the third the third law is for
    every action there is an equal and opposite reaction you have an action and a
    reaction force so here I am standing look we're officially doing Neuroscience
    that's me I'm standing and I'm standing on the ground and I weigh one body mass
    and I am being pulled down by this horrible Planet at a rate of G if you drop
    me from a c from a place up high I would accelerate downward at 9.8 meters per
    second squared let's call it 10 uh and and that's that's always happening

    the A and the f equals Ma and I'm move and I'm so I'm being pulled down by that
    amount but I'm not moving so the so there must be something else pushing back
    with exactly the same force and that's that's our good friend the ground the ground
    is a very useful object it allows us to complete most of our goals and as I am
    pushing this is the action I am pushing into the ground with mass times Gravity
    Force and the ground is dutifully pushing back with exactly negative masstimes
    Gravity Force great if I ever decide to break this equation I can push if I like
    if I decide to push off the ground with more than that than than more than gravity
    is pulling me then I can do such a wacky thing is jump so I put Force into the
    ground it's more than I weigh I briefly airborne and then gravity pulls me back
    down um and that winds up being important for a lot of stuff okay I need to speed
    up here um okay okay I think I know how this is going to go so great so this is
    our this is your uh preview of high level human movement Neuroscience um but we
    gotta we got to do a little more work before we can get into the the meat there
    let's go back to thinking about simple simple spheroids um such as brightly colored
    juggling balls um so yeah so when you're doing empirical studies you're doing
    empirical measurements you always have to make assumptions that's always going
    to be a thing that you're doing you have to make assumptions that your senses
    aren't lying to you at all times you make assumptions that when you read papers
    that the people who did that study are not actively lying to you and falsifying
    all their data um you have to make assumptions about yeah and every time you make
    an assumption you get a little bit more predictive power um so if I if I'm trying
    to measure my body moving through space I know that this is

    my wrist changes ever so slightly because I am made of squishy meat but if I just
    assume that I'm that that that's just not happening and that I'm actually composed
    of rigid bodies that don't change length then I get a lot I get a lot my math
    gets easier because now I don't have to measure the length between these things
    I only have to meure the angles between them um and so those assumptions that
    we make and wind the only the only measurement you can make without making assumptions
    is that you are having a conscious experience at this exact moment and that's
    just not very useful um so this is where we come back to what I was talking about
    earlier where this the idea of a conservation of energy winds up being one of
    those very very powerful and very very useful assumptions that can really get
    us a lot of the way towards understanding the things that we care about the desiderata
    of our research goals the things that is desired in our research activity um because
    again looking at this object there's a lot like if if my desire is to understand
    something like standing posture or God forbid Locomotion uh there's a lot there
    there there are many many aspects of that question that I cannot measure empirically
    I just don't have the technological capacity to measure the firing in my cerebellum
    or the stretch forces in my muscles I can't measure that but I can measure things
    like the sort of the stick figure position of my body 33 times per second using
    something like a motion capture system that I built over time in my house um and
    so by using that thing that I can measure in these certain assumptions about conservation
    of energy I can start to have I can start to try to understand like the the what
    we'll just call the technical term it's the fidly bits um and this is going to
    fuz out I think in a bit uh that we'll we'll sort of like we'll pick up I get
    probably around here next week um but I'm going to get through it all so that
    at least it's at least you will have experienced it at least one time um so when
    you're thinking about when you're doing sort of a mechanical analysis of a person
    um you can you want to think about what are the forms of energy that are relevant
    to this task that I'm looking at here um and in this part of the class we're just
    measuring movement the motor control part we're not looking at perception we're
    not looking at Vision so we get to ignore things like light and we get to focus
    on just the simple physics of being a massive object in a world that has such
    things as ground and gravity and so the forms of energy that we can really measure
    and we can really care about are mostly
- dur: 180.0
  end: 4320.0
  start: 4140.0
  text: potential energy and kinetic energy and there's a lot of forms of potential
    energy um the most obvious and easy one is gravitational potential energy which
    is the distance so this is the ground we'll call that the height is zero you got
    to do that doesn't matter where we are horizontally but it does matter where we
    are vertically and so po potential energy gravitation potential energy equals
    mass gravity height so which again mass is kilogram meters per second squared
    height is again in meters you can do the math and figure out that this the units
    will be Newtons when you do that and so the potential energy is basically a measurement
    of if I had this object and I dropped it the force that it would that if I put
    like a scale underneath that the force that it would put into that scale is this
    many newtons um yeah other forms of potential energy which we're not really going
    to talk as much about are things like spring potential energy so if like stretchiness
    of a spring also chemical potential energy which is like food and bombs and gasoline
    and stuff like that a lot of the sort of the deeper level biology you're going
    to start getting into chemical potential energy and that's when you start things
    seeing things like the ion charges don't line up so there's ex that's you start
    measuring into the colums or whatever that electrical unit is so that's the potential
    energy is like a mismatch between the way that the world would really prefer to
    be and the way that the world currently is so the low energy state if I wasn't
    holding this the low energy state of the world would be this on the ground and
    so if I let go then I know how much energy is going to be hit there da da d da
    um the other one to think about is kinetic energy which is the physics of M M
    so if you were to measure yeah so kinetic energy is half kinetic energy 12 met
    MV squ 1 12 MV squ at mass is kilograms velocity is meters per second do the math
    I promise you it will turn out to be Newtons because it's a measure of force and
    it is the amount of force that would be hit like if I were to drop this the instantaneous
    moment before it hits the ground it would be having the an how it would have a
    certain amount of kinetic energy how much kinetic energy would it have it would
    have exactly the same amount of kinetic energy as it had potential energy before
    I dropped it and if you add these things together oh no not do that and yeah and
    so

  end: 4500.0
  start: 4320.0
  text: using that type of analysis potential and kinetic energy is where you get
    things like the parabolic Flight of the object through space because as it leaves
    my hand it has the instantaneous moment that it breaks contact with my hand and
    it's in Free Flight it has a certain amount of kinetic energy and it has the most
    energy that it's going to have for this entire trajectory uh has maximum kinetic
    energy minimum potential energy and it goes up through space the kinetic energy
    it slows down as it goes up and it gets higher so the potential energy increases
    until it reaches a point where it's at the Apex and the potential energy is now
    at the max because it's as high as it's going to get the kinetic energy is at
    the minimum because it's it's briefly uh it briely has zero velocity when it goes
    from moving up to moving down um and then it's going to come back the other way
    and when it hits when it gets right the moment right the moment right over hit
    the ground hits my hand again it will have the same amount of kinetic energy as
    it had when it started so you get this nice sort of trade-off there so this is
    a much so when I talked about things like transduction for for vision or for action
    or for somata sensation or things like that we're talking about a transfer of
    energy from one form for light let's say Candelas into another form which is a
    pattern of neural activity measured by voltages and electron ion mismatches and
    stuff like that um there's there's so much that's not measurable in that conversion
    um but physics would have us believe that if you could tally up every ion and
    every sort of quantum of of energy the math of that conversion would match would
    would work out as perfectly as The Cannonball physics of simple ballistic motion
    does um because this transition from kinetic potential energy is also transduction
    that is also a transfer of energy from one form to another um yeah uh we're ignoring
    if I was a bird I could flap my wings and push against air sufficiently to get
    a reaction force to sort of counteract gravity um if I if this was a pogo stick
    and I sort of compressed it and then threw it then it hit then it would have a
    bunch of spring potential energy that when it hit the ground it might bounce additionally
    but if we assume the simple rigid body uh physics then that kinetic and potential
    energy is going to sort of yeah have this nice conservative tradeoff this will
    become important later

  text: um so now we get to my favorite part um which I will will only be just a little
    taster uh and then we will talk at about this at length next time and that's the
    concept of the center of mass um the center of mass is a term in physics you probably
    heard it in some it comes up a lot in like uh you know Sports and especially anything
    related like gymnastics and balance stuff like that you hear people talk about
    the center of mass as um like the position of your body um run out of time here
    I'll just do it so the center of mass is um the average position of all of the
    oops excuse me is the average position of all of the objects of all the components
    of the larger object so if I were to take this tube and cut it up into 1 cm long
    sections and then took the position of those sections relative to a zero point
    or any zero point and took the average of all of them it would be in the middle
    of the thing and that is the center of mass and it turns out that when you're
    supporting something above the ground you do it by supporting the center of mass
    of the thing so if I were to hold it over here then the center of mass would fall
    and it wouldn't stay on my hand um if I were to put a weight so these are like
    ankle weights they look like they're from like the '90s I also found them on the
    street near my house there's like a place for people in the neighborhood just
    like put sort of like garbage before like before it goes away um and I found these
    and they're sort of useful for this so by putting this it weighs like a pound
    I think so like half a kilogram um and so now before it was on here this thing
    was of uniform density so the center of mass was in the middle of it now it's
    not of uniform density so the center of mass shifts to here now this is the center
    of mass of the system so now when I want to support the system I have to take
    into account the shift and density of all the things that are a part of that system
    um and so if we really wanted to we could determine how much this thing weighs
    in units of stick by measuring the distance between this balance point and the
    center of the stick which is where we would balance it on if it it was symmetrically
    oriented like that um I don't want to but we

  text: could uh and that concept of balance as the relationship between the center
    of mass and the base of support is something we're going to talk about a lot uh
    yeah but um but yeah so similarly so we talked a little bit about um the concept
    of like reductionist approaches to Scientific studies which is like trying to
    trying to nail down like that the problem I said before like I'm I want to measure
    this thing that I care about but I don't have the ability to measure all the parts
    of it with the precis that I need to do that one approach to to dealing with that
    problem is to narrow your focus and rather than trying to explain the entire complexity
    of the thing that's moving which is not available for empirical measurement you
    can look at a smaller and smaller and smaller piece of it um and so instead of
    looking at the whole body you might sort of look at just the movement of like
    a single joint or something like that or the single arm or something like that
    um and keep that same sort of full level of fidelity of still thinking about this
    weird shape in you in terms of like a thing that has all of these joint angles
    that can Define it its position at a given point in time um but even for something
    like this which is a a massive simplification of of of a human this is still a
    pretty complex object physically speaking like there's still a lot of joints that
    can vary and you have as many degrees of freedom as you have joints times two
    or three depending on how you count so Define the position the the ident the position
    of this kinematic object in space requires a lot of different numbers and that's
    going to be sort of hard to deal with um the other approach is to just simplify
    down the system that you're looking at into a a massive oversimplification um
    and and try to do that in such a way that still allows you to say things about
    the system as a whole so like and that's basically what the idea of the center
    of mass is so rather than thinking about this whole complex thing with all the
    joints and all the muscles and all the the blood pumping and all the sort of the
    the biological realities going on there um we can instead uh condense it down
    [Music] into a simplified system so this is something I made some years ago um

    of these body segments so the segment of the forearm the the upper arm the head
    the chest the legs you take the average of all those positions uh weighted by
    the mass of that object so like the forearm weighs a lot less than the legs for
    example this is the position that you get and then if you measure the limits of
    the base of support here um as the the distance between the tips of his fingers
    to the heel of his hand which those are the places where you can put Force into
    the ground the center of mass always stays within that space so you can know that
    even though there's a lot going on here biologically from a physics perspective
    that you can Define the task of balance using these sort of very hyper simplified
    models of the body which take the entire complexity of a human person and boil
    it down to a singular Point Mass which in this case is in two Dimensions but it
    could be in three dimensions and we have now um simplified the world down to a
    place that starts to feel more tractable uh I can handle this many numbers I can't
    I can kind of handle this many numbers but not really um but this is a place where
    uh if you by the way in on the list on the the notes if you click on on this where
    is it uh Co gifts it goes to a link to a bunch of those types of animations that
    I made we'll talk about them more later um oh do that there we go um yeah and
    so so you can reduce down this complex object of a human down to a singular Point
    Mass and physics has told us I I believe it's like the finite element theorem
    or something like that but I'm not really 100% sure on that it's basically says
    that things that you say about the center of mass of a system are true to some
    extent of the other object of all the objects in that system so talking about
    the center of mass of that person um is a valid approximation of what the full
    picture would be if if I was measuring every single sort of cube of his body you
    know at at the same time um you're obviously going to be losing a lot of of of
    information so if I'm only thinking about the suar this one's another wacky guy
    so if I'm boiling down this guy's entire body to this singular Mass I can no longer
    really say things about the joint angles or the forces at the elbow stuff like
    that but I can determine whether or not he's in a stable regime or an unstable

    movements actually mean so like when it why like without this sort of center of
    mass analysis it might be hard to explain why his arm is out here it might they
    might not have much to say about that but when you're thinking about it like this
    it becomes very easy like he sticks his arm out so that his Center like if I move
    my arm and leg like this the average of them keeps my body over my foot um and
    I I can do this but I can't I can't do that it's anyway you'll figure it out um
    I'll show you visual representations of this once you actually get the the numbers
    next week um right and then yeah uh and you might ask the question of how do we
    do these measurements how do we get these numbers and soort how do I know where
    to draw the segment Center of mass for his torso versus how like what percentage
    of a body weight is a forearm like how do you get those numbers uh well it turns
    out we just we have these lookup tables this is called anthropometry um yeah and
    these are just this this is statistics Oh wrong way ah um right um so these particular
    lookup tables come from a guy named David winter uh this is copied from a textbook
    of his from like 1995 or something like that and it shows these measurements of
    the shoulder is 0.129 H where H is the body height and so he and then these are
    the lookup table for these segments so the forearm is defined as the dist as the
    the space between the elbow axis in theer styloid I guess is here uh it's 028
    of an M which is a body mass and the center of mass is4 36% of the wave from the

    which is the one that's farther away so

    moving your your feet around the distances the the differences between those estimates
    for the different sort of categories of human um are just not they're below the

    like that so okay that was a lot uh hope you got something out of it um it will
    not be on the test there is no test uh it's just it's much more try to internalize
    it try to conceptualize it try to think more about the concepts than the details
