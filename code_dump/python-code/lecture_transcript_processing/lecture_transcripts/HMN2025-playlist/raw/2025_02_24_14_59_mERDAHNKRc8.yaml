full_transcript: okay hello hello hello hi all right Let's do let's do today so um
  I guess spring break is next week so that's nice uh I once again standing here before
  you as a liar and a generally untrustworthy person because I said I was going to
  have the stuff for this done by today um I don't I you know hit some it's like I
  I I once again did the thing of making an assignment that requires technical capacity
  that did not exist at the time that I made the assignment um so I'll give you a
  quick update on that um but I should have something I I'll I'll try to have something
  done by Wednesday and then just push all the deadlines out um so that kind of like
  things will kind of be spread out over the end of the you know the rest next of
  the couple weeks and um yeah you should all be set up for it so uh the content of
  the lecture today is going to be about vision and eyeballs and sort of how that
  stuff generally Works we've covered it a little bit in the kind of like the overview
  stuff at the beginning of the semester but now we're going to go a little more in
  depth of that stuff so some things that I sort of probably hit pretty fast in passing
  I'm going to hit still pretty fast in passing but at a slightly slower rate um but
  yeah and then so next Wednesday so to tomorrow class uh Wednesday class um I will
  bring in an eye tracker and we'll do kind of an eye tracking demo um similar to
  the one I did with the motion capture but less involved because it's you know all
  the cameras in that process are attached to my head so it's a little bit easier
  to set up um and then yeah then we'll have spring break and we'll kind of go over
  that and blah BL the rest of the class uh in quick let's see how much time I want
  to do this I'll go I think I'll I'll I'll do it uh I'll just give a quick update
  on kind of the you know my assignment for the course of making sense of all your
  guys' wacky nonsense uh so the so very quickly the the the technical side of the
  thing I need to do um there you go yeah so the the main technical challenge here
  is that I I I want to do these exam chats which I talked about last week but a lot
  of youall weren't here so I'll say it again um is basically to sort of create some
  chat spaces in the server uh where the bot has been kind of uh The Prompt of the
  bot has been doped with the content of the lecture that I've been giving and recording
  and putting online um and then have kind of like two forms of that chat set up one
  of which is sort of designed to work with you kind of grinding through whatever
  your chosen topic was and trying to attach the concepts that we've been talking
  about in terms of like the sort of philosophy of science aspects of like empirical
  measurement and sort of like what's the you know what's actually being recorded
  from the environment and stuff like that um and sort of connecting those thoughts
  to the topic that you have chosen um and then the other version of that will be
  specifically tuned to helping you come up with your poster proposal number two um
  which is basically just kind of an outline sort of schematized form of your paper
  that says this is my paper this is the methods you know this is the intro methods
  results discussion sort of in you know two sentences or less about the paper that
  I've chosen um and then that will be kind of the content of the poster that you're
  actually sort of submitting um which so yeah uh and then the the poster draft wants
  to be due um the week after spring break and I'll I'll do trying to figure out where
  probably in here right now it doesn't make sense I don't know um I'll have some
  time in class to kind of like you know go over what you have and sort of answer
  questions and things like that um the draft is not the final of the not the final
  form of it it's sort of the intention is that this is it's it is a completed poster
  which if you were forced to you could print and sort of talk about um but we're
  intentionally going to give some space to that so that you can have time to kind
  of go over it with people around you and sort of like you know have a couple couple
  couple opportunities to kind of like try to work through it with your classmates
  it's kind of be like oh wait I actually wish this was this way that way and the
  other so that by the time we actually submit the thing to be uploaded and printed
  on March 25th uh you're about ready for it because yeah once it's printed it just
  exists and so you can't it's good to have some opportunities to edit there um so
  yeah so the technical side of that is the part of uh you know condensing down the
  lectures into a form that can fit into the prompt of an AI bot um which just by
  way of sort of like passive education I'll just point out where that's happening
  in the the course repository so because it's kind of like so at this point I think
  there's sixish recorded lectures Each of which is like somewhere between an hour
  to an hour and a half long um so that's a lot of just words it's a lot of you know
  human saying words and it's relatively easy at this point in history and my own
  personal development to pull the content like the pull the the words that were spoken
  in a in a video on YouTube into a text based format um but there's a couple challenges
  there because uh for the one thing it's just so many work like the the number of
  words that you say when speaking for an hour and a half is much much higher than
  the actual meaningful content that you're expressing um and also when you speak
  out loud you are not generally speaking grammatically like if you wrote down the
  words that I'm speaking which I know because I've been looking at that it sounds
  like a person having a stroke like it's not like we feel like we're speaking in
  grammatical form sentences but we're not like and so uh I've been writing some sort
  of AI code sort of sloppy by my own personal standards but don't does the job um
  that goes through and firsts does this kind of thing so takes takes the content
  chunks it out into 10-minute sections and then just sends it to an AI that says
  clean this up and remove all the um and a and make it into grammatical sentences
  and stuff like that this code is effectively the same thing as copy pasting things
  into the Discord bot um it's just happens in an automated way so if I give an hourlong
  lecture that's chunked into 10 minute chunks that's six total chunks and so that's
  this just runs in a loop and does that um so it takes the lectures cleans them up
  and then this is the part that's not quite actually not the first part is it pulls
  it from YouTube um then it this is the part where I'm going to take those chunks
  and then sort of boil them down into kind of like outline formats at which point
  will have been condensed down to the point that they can be kind of included in
  a bot chat and sort of sort of the idea is that having a conversation with the bot
  that has been prompted by all this stuff will be kind of like you know a a crappy
  simulation of what it would be like if I was sitting down and working through this
  sort of you know one-on-one um which I would love to do but uh the realities of
  numbers sort of make that difficult um so if you're curious about that you can look
  in here in the court repo uh this lecture transcripts has got kind of the I guess
  was it cleaned is the probably yeah what is that right I don't know anyways but
  it's it's a lot of words these are all the words I've said to you um yeah so so
  that's ongoing uh and then the other ECT of that of kind of the exam chats is that
  um I'll be asking you to sort of pull in the uh the profiles that have been kind
  of getting extracted about you so I've we talked about this before but like uh the
  lecture they think the the chats that you've been having with the bot have been
  you know part of this process is that I periodically scraped through the server
  pull those out and then try to again pull out all the chats that you've had smush
  them together and shove them into the bot and say what is this person interested
  in what is their sort of focus what should they be what are some things they might
  want to look at and think about and da da da so that has also been ongoing um the
  latest of that which I think I'm I'm not this one I'm not going to go into um but
  I I again put a zip file of the latest um sort of server wide analyses come on Discord
  um in the Discord Channel um except this one now has two forms there's it's uh like
  the zip file has two two folders in it one of which the student profiles for each
  of you are based off of only your chats from the assignments category um so like
  the like the ones you've been specifically prompted to do um and the other one uses
  all all of the chats that you've had total so every chat that you participated in
  is is part of it um where is it yeah links and resources uh This Server scrape checkpoints
  and this last one here as yeah these two things in it and again these are exactly
  the same from the exact same period time which is everything that happened before
  about like 8:00 a.m. this morning um and that's one that says profiles from all
  channels your profile in there is based off your every chat that has every every
  chat that has your ID in it and any place um is included there so all the class
  assignments and stuff like that uh profiles from assignments Channel only is all
  the chats that you've had that are in the assignments wait is it assignments Channel
  or category how did I do that yeah in the assment category I although I just realized
  now I may have done that wrong so it might they might both have all of you might
  have everything in it because I did a filter but I think I might have been filtering
  by Channel instead of category so it may not have worked so um that's an easy fix
  but uh yeah I'm not going to dig into that but if you want to go in there and kind
  of like compare what's going on there if they're exactly the same then I know that
  I screwed that up um and but if they're different um part of the the the exam is
  chat looking things are like part of that assignment is going to be sort of pulling
  in that profile and sort of copy pasting it into the chat so that you know you not
  starting from scratch so that's going to be one of those things where like I'll
  show you where the high water mark is for that and you can kind of choose how you
  want to take that file and edit it and sort of delete things you don't think are
  appropriate add things you think are appropriate um and so I'll probably make both
  of these format available to you and you kind of mix and match for yourself and
  kind of like you can decide how you want to prompt the bot to know who you are um
  or if you just don't think it's useful just just don't do it all and then you have
  to explain it explain yourself again um okay any questions about that make sense
  roughly cool okay great well let's talk about eyeballs eh um so eyeballs they live
  on your face the average human has slightly less than two and they're generally
  very useful things great um this is one of those lectur that like I've given this
  lecture in various formats many many times and I've never really come up with like
  my personal favorite way of doing it it's so this is just kind of like a list of
  things I want to make sure to hit um and I think let's start is this going to want
  to be a combination of like drawing and stuff on the screen so yeah okay let's do
  this okay so we spent so we talked a little bit about Vision in the start of the
  class but we we spent the majority of the time since then talking about motor control
  uh motor control is sort of moving in the world so roughly speaking um anything
  that involves like muscles and sort of the generation of force that moves Mass connected
  to your body uh is under the category of motor control um motor like motion and
  uh the and you know good thing to be able to do um I think my particular area of
  expertise in studying neuroscience and neural control of movement is in what is
  generally called perceptual motor control um where the O in the middle means it's
  sort of perceptual SL motor so it's kind of like the the connection between the
  perceptual systems of the body and the motor systems of the body um and those are
  two things that are often uh studied to Great you know effect in isolation of each
  other um but there's in sort of natural behavior especially um they're not really
  separable in the same kind of way Like to Move Your Body effectively in a complex
  and dynamic World requires you to have good perceptual information about that world
  so knowing where things are is a very important component of planning your motions
  and your Mo your movements out effectively um and vision is a very uh sort of a
  classic uh sense not every animal uses Vision um entirely but sort of as as not
  every not every animal has Vision as core to their nervous system as we do but it
  is a very classic um environmental energy to be tapped into um we're going to talk
  about kind of The evolutionary elements of that at some at the later point in the
  semester I don't know what I'm trying to do here um but it's basically been around
  for as long as there have been microbes or of the ability to absorb photons from
  the world and determine sort of dark areas from Bright areas is a thing that even
  single- celled organisms do sort of like the rise up to the top of the pool of water
  in the daytime and drop down at night and that type of thing so let's take a quick
  trip through the main sort of Pathways of the perceptual system and the yeah so
  let's start with light itself um so light is covered by like the study of light
  is generally covered under the field of Optics um where Optics is kind of the the
  part of physics that involves with photons and sort of refractions and lenses and
  stuff like that historically the first sort of the origins of the study of Optics
  as a specific um field um it's generally attributed to iel hyam uh who was 7th Century
  Century uh modern Iraq um wasn't called Iraq back then but it was a um he was a
  scholar in the seventh seventh to n9th Century I can't remember exactly when um
  but he was uh the first person to kind of like start thinking about light specifically
  and start thinking specifically about light in the context of like light is the
  thing that sort of travels in straight lines and um can be measured in that way
  so uh pinhole camera so The Story Goes that he pinhole camera andhole camera I Alam
  yeah so The Story Goes that he was in his tent in the bright bright sun and notice
  that with if there was a pinhole prick in the in the walls of one of these otherwise
  opaque uh walls of the tent um you could see an image of the world projected onto
  the other side of the of the tent this was and this is known as a holiday obscura
  or a pinhole camera this was not the first time in history that this sort of optical
  effect was discovered I think the original reference of it was in like some sort
  of ancient Chinese um text uh but it wasn't at that time it was sort of presented
  at that point time is like um like hey here's this weird thing that happens in less
  of a sort of like a looking into like there was less of an understanding of like
  why that happened and sort of what's going on it sort of like a documentation of
  a strange Optical effect more than a um the beginning of a deep dive into the mathematics
  behind Optics soam wrote the book of Optics which we're going to come back to um
  wherein he wrote like a very long Treatise on the study of light and specifically
  the study of how it interacts with our visual system and including some very precient
  um well not preent just accurate uh anatomical models of the of the early visual
  system and these thoughts were sort of roughly lost for about you know not Lo but
  they they did not make it into Europe for about 5 to 600 years um when dayart came
  along and translated a bunch of stuff um and yeah so like the main so the main idea
  here was kind of this discovery of light as a thing that exists sort of independently
  in nature obviously people had known that light exists um but it wasn't the kind
  of thing that had been specifically studied as like an independent natural entity
  and the first thing that he was doing in addition to kind of this nice anatomical
  work was just sort of mapping out the basic geometries of how what happens if you
  have this sort of stuff that travels in straight lines and figuring out things like
  you know why the if you in this pinhole camera situation why you have the uh the
  images show up inverted on the project image and it's because of all this nice sort
  of you know if the light that's coming from the Sun bouncing off the top of the
  Minette sort of travels down to that point TR point to the bottom travels up to
  that point that's how you get the kind of inverted image there um and you'll see
  this image a lot sort of like projection in the eye yeah this is sort of of classic
  textbook stuff where you're presenting the imagees sort of like backward like upside
  down on the retina which is true but it's sort of I think it kind of misses some
  of the point but that's fine um so one of the interesting things one of like the
  one of I think one of the reasons why this guy is sort of considered to be like
  one of the sort of Scholars of History was he did a lot of that early work on Optics
  and like he kind of hit most of the major points like pretty pretty straight off
  the bat um and particularly in kind of the idea you know just sort of project in
  the projective geometry oh it's this one I already have up oh yeah well B2 projected
  yeah so like this is the kind of um epipolar geometry that that is used behind that
  motion capture thing and dra through the 3D projection all that kind of stuff um
  and these are sort of represent these are um like tutorial images from like modern
  software packages on how to do computer vision and most of the math for this was
  kind of worked out way back then um the main thing that he didn't have the main
  thing that he couldn't quite figure out um was refraction and the way that light
  can so he understood that light travels in straight lines but he didn't really understand
  how lenses worked and so when you look if you look at some of these uh images of
  the eye come on man anyways um a lot of the labels and stuff that happen in here
  are accurate to this day um except the one thing that he kind of had wacky going
  on was in the the lens of the eye he believed that there was a little demon that
  lived and sort of bent the light to make it make sense not to say that he believed
  that there were demons living in your eyes but it was sort of like a I think I've
  already said this in this class but like it was kind of like a placeholder of like
  I'm not sure what's happening in here so I understand that the straight line math
  doesn't work out because your eyes are too small to do that kind of projection um
  so it probably has to do with this little thing right here but I don't really understand
  how that part Works um and that kind of projective geometry that kind of um refraction
  stuff uh I don't quite know the the specific history there but um you know that
  was worked out much later I suppose I should also mention just in the history of
  things that um originally we believed that light before we really understood light
  as kind of this environmental thing Vision was sort of conceived of as something
  that was emitted from your face like when you look at stuff it's called emission
  Theory um that they thought that there was like sort of these like beams of not
  light but beams of something that sort of shot out out of your face when you looked
  at stuff and that was how you received the sensory information from the world so
  in the same sense way that you sort of reach out with your limbs to touch things
  they thought that there was some kind of like invisible substance that was being
  projected from your eyes and that stuff touching things was how you uh perceived
  the world and that was the domly for a long time and sort of in like Black Death
  times they would do things like cover people's eyes when they were sick because
  they didn't they knew that like you don't want to touch sick people because that
  will you know transmit disease so they thought it would cover the eyes to sort of
  make sure that you don't get hit with the eye lasers um anyways uh yeah and then
  yeah anys whatever so so that's kind of yeah the old school Optics and these days
  like if you if you go to a if you take an Optics course and I think that'll be mechanical
  no I don't know what kind of engineering that would be it would be in the engineering
  department but I'm not sure who probably physics maybe Proby physics teaches Optics
  um you'll learn about what's called Snell's law which Snell's law tells us uh all
  the things that can happen when light hits a surface or basically as light is coming
  in has wavelengths and stuff like that and when it hits a surface it will either
  transmit go straight through it be absorbed into the material itself or reflect
  so transmission absorption reflection those are the three things that light can
  do when it hits a surface and every surface in the world uh will have properties
  uh related to this and if it is transmitted transmission also has a refraction angle
  so for sometime sometimes when light pass it through a surface it goes straight
  through and for other surfaces it will refract by a certain amount and the the refraction
  angle is is dependent on the angle that it that the hits the surface as well as
  like the index of refraction which is just sort of a a property that things have
  so so prop so substances like glass have a very low index of refraction so when
  you look straight through it not much happens um other Sur so you know if you have
  something like a lens then you have refractive aspects that sort of bend the light
  to the point where it focuses so if you hit if it's coming straight on it goes straight
  through if it's coming in from an angle it's refracted in like that and so that's
  basically how a lens can focus light and on things and that's how cameras work that's
  how glasses work all that kind of stuff so this is sort of the snail's law Optics
  of what's happening when the light from the world first hits your eye um so let's
  do this sure yeah nice so this is an eyeball or it's a picture of an eyeball and
  we can use this to kind stuff out um so this is very much not to scale um but does
  the job so this is a side view of your eyeball and this thick part here which this
  looks very thick to me I don't know if there's I don't know how accurate that is
  but um it could be um so this thick part out here is called the cornea the cornea
  is a clear surface on the the outside of your eye when you're looking at somebody's
  eyes you are looking at their corneas because that's the outermost surface um and
  it is you know again I don't know if it's proportionally this thick um but it is
  it is thick and it does have refractive properties and when light is coming in from
  the world uh the first thing that it hits is the cornea and so the majority of the
  refraction that happens on your eye that sort of focuses the image on the back of
  your retina is happening passively by the the refractive properties of the cornea
  um that yeah and we'll we'll come back to that and look for a better picture of
  this next part um actually yeah this is the better picture open there you go so
  this is the cornea this this proportionality looks closer to me there is kind of
  a an empty space that is there's there's a lot of fluid filled cap cavities in your
  eye um filled with something called the aquous humor which is basically like a a
  clear gelatinous like fluid liquid type of thing um and then this part so the the
  light hits your cornea is refracted in numbers wise the number I remember is about
  80% of the refraction happens at the cornea level um and then Bas in that that refraction
  happens the sell's lothing happens every time light hits a surface that is a different
  density from the one that it's currently traveling through so light is not refracting
  when it's traveling through air other than when it's sort of bouncing off of uh
  sort of water molecules that are suspended in the air which is why the sky is blue
  as a whole other conversation um but for our purposes we can assume that like the
  refraction process will happen every time there's a boundary between sort of transmissive
  fluid of one density over here to a different density over here so that first refraction
  Point happens at end of the cornea and then it sort of goes through this empty sort
  of gets into this opening here this opening is called your pupil perhaps you've
  heard of it um so your pupil is one of these nice things that like it's not it doesn't
  have an independent existence it's basically the name that we give to a void of
  space uh your pupil is basically the opening in the center of your iris and the
  iris is a sphincter muscle uh one of your body's finest sphincters um whose job
  is basically to open and close to let through different amounts of light relative
  to the environment that you're in and it's basically it there's a lot of interesting
  reflexes that happen there um the main one that you probably think about is that
  when you're in a bright when you're a very bright room your pupil constricts which
  lets through less light when you're in a darker setting your people expands which
  let do more light which has a lot of sort of optical properties there um I think
  that's related to like the aperture like if you're a photography person it's related
  to the aperture um I'm not going to say too much about that there are other there's
  other things that happen your I your your pupil um dilation is affected by other
  aspects of your physiology um sort of like things like fear and relaxation and stuff
  like that um like if you get startled they surprised like an adrenaline Burse will
  constrict your pupils um and there's a lot of literature studying pupilometry I
  think too much literature studying pupilometry I think it's one of those things
  and we'll talk about this in the context of the eye tracker uh on Wednesday um it's
  one of these things where I think that because the p because it's fair easy to measure
  the pupil size from an eye tracker and because you can measure that you can look
  at that signal independently of the actual context that it's happening in I think
  there's just sort of like a soci sociological effect for there's people wind up
  studying like the pupilometry and the effects of like different emotional states
  and different stimuli on your pupil side I think that is studied way way too much
  and there's way way too much literature on that mostly because it is relatively
  easy to study so the field kind of gets flooded with studies that use that kind
  of that type of an outcome so it's one of those cases where it's like I'm not saying
  no we shouldn't study it but I am saying that if you were to go out and start looking
  at it tracking looking at papers on ey tracking you would find a lot of papers about
  pupilometry and you'll be forgiven for thinking wow this is the most important thing
  to think about here um but resist that feeling um it is not I think it's yeah it's
  it's fine um let's switch pictures again yeah works so yeah and so the light is
  coming through it's coming in from you know all all directions you're always being
  hit by all the light that's sort of bouncing and scattering off of everything in
  the world and as that light sort of bounces it is it it becomes coupled with the
  things that it's bouncing off of um if you really want to dig into the quantum aspects
  of it they they do show up here like when light bounces off of an object of a given
  color that that color is absorbed so the light that comes off of it so like that
  that wall back there is green then when the light bounces off of it all of the red
  wavelengths are absorbed and the stuff that comes off of it is green assuming that
  the light in the environment is generally white which usually is um broad spectrum
  um then the light that's sort of bouncing into my retina from that part of the room
  has had all the red wavelength sucked out of it and so the light that comes in is
  only within the wavelength band that corresponds to like that kind of bluish greenish
  color of that back wall and so that's that's jumping ahead a bit but so the light
  comes through it refracts some of it makes it through this people opening um yeah
  oous humor there uh humor is another one of those like medieval science terms like
  talk about your humors and balance stuff like that so this is from that sort of
  era um and then once the light makes it to your your pupil it hits the second main
  refractory sort of substance in your eye uh which is the lens um and the lens is
  a little it's a it's a lens it looks like a little lens made out of sort of a clear
  structural sort of biological it's not a goop because the the aquous humor is a
  goop the lens is like an object like a more of a it has its own sort of but it's
  like it's um it's elastic and clear and sort of oblong in that way and it is also
  actively controlled like your your your brain at some level um is controlling how
  much it should compress uh this this lens it has these this is saying that these
  are ligaments um which I I believe it there are also muscles attached um and the
  muscles pull the lens to different shapes and the different shapes have different
  refractive indexes so if it's like this it refracts more and then you pull it more
  elongo elongated and it refracts less and all of these things have the effect of
  sort of changing the the focal point of the light that's traveling through your
  eyes relative to the to the point in space that you're fixating at so when you're
  looking at something and it's in focus on the back of your eyes where in Focus means
  that you can tell the difference between you know thin lines and stuff like that
  um that Focus implies that that focal point of the light is on your retina and so
  your brain using some kind of using a variety of complex mechanisms is going to
  try to uh stretch and bend this lens structure in order to put that focal point
  on the back of your your retina how does it know when things are in Focus how does
  it control it what are the feedback loops these are all great questions that I can
  guess at but I don't really know sort of like we're sort of at my depth with some
  of this ey physiology stuff um it's also the case that uh so and it's also this
  is something that you can control yourself so if you're um I think this might one
  of those things like wiggling your ears where not everybody can actually do it on
  their own but you can at least try and so if you just like look at something and
  kind of like fuzz it out like if you if you look at an object and there's kind of
  like you know a flex whatever muscle you have to flex to make that thing go in and
  out of focus you are controlling your lens when that's happening that's that's the
  thing that you're flexing is is your lens um um so you know um it also many of you
  including me are probably wearing some sort of corrective lenses so glasses contacts
  something like that um because you might say and you might even be able to like
  find some some shyy medical stuff online suggesting that you need to that you can
  you can exercise the lens muscle and then you don't you won't need glasses anymore
  um that is not actually true um because of that sort of 80/20 division of labor
  there um because remember like 80% of the refraction is happening at the cornea
  level um and only sort of the the the length is only doing just a little bit more
  of that so you're not going to be able to actively correct for the whole thing being
  out of whack um or it's like amblyopia sort of like your ey is like too oblong so
  if you're far sided too oblong if you're near sided it to whatever that sh is um
  that shape is um and so the corrective lenses that you have is basically augmenting
  the corneus so if you're in contacts you're basically putting another layer on top
  of it uh or if you're in glasses you're putting another lens out here to to bend
  the light a little bit before it even hits the retina so that the the resting state
  of this will have the light generally um in focus on the back of your eye was that
  yeah yeah so that's that's like that's for like a stigmatism um which I don't really
  understand I know what you're talking about and it's like because like a stigmatism
  is like I don't really know what that is that's a layer of Optometry below me um
  and but yeah it's like the the the context sit on top of it it's got some kind of
  a suction thing and so it like it pulls the cornea into like a slightly different
  shape to to help some it's it's changing the passive refractive properties of the
  cornea um and it lasts like about a day so you wear them overnight and then like
  you wake up it's wacky I don't know yeah yeah yeah it's like hard hard contact lenses
  was we we've got past that as a technology but that was for a while like contact
  lenses were hard glass things you have a question slightly bigger yes larger like
  more stronger okay okay yeah so I think a stigmatism is kind so because like near
  sided and farsighted it has to do with like the overall eyeball shape um and so
  I think a stigmatism has to do with like the cornea itself yeah it's the corne shap
  yeah yeah and so the thing of like like the shaping that happens at the eyes or
  yeah okay musle uh so you definitely need to take your contacts out because of like
  sanitation and all that stuff but the the other thing that you're saying I think
  that's just not true I think that's like I I I I'm not sure who's saying that if
  it's like an eye doctor then maybe but if it's not an eye doctor I think I don't
  believe that I I I am going to pull I am also technically a doctor rank can say
  that I don't think that's how that works I think that we we very rapidly adapt to
  so first of all your eyes just change over time and like and they stabilize for
  me for me my eyes were I was getting different prescriptions like every time I went
  to the doctor until I hit like 25 or something like that and then I've been at the
  same prescription for you know since then um we also have very different perspectives
  on how much focus and precision we expect from our vision so we all know people
  at least I know people you may be one of these people who like has glasses but doesn't
  wear them and they're like I can yeah I can tell immediately yeah and so what will
  happen is if you it's like it's like I remember I I had a friend who who was who
  was who had that sort of Personality capacity which is fine not uh and like it was
  kind of thing it's like I would look I was looking I was like oh yeah it's like
  out there by that sign that says you know speed limit is 25 and he was just like
  you can see that like because you know we we all have a distance that we don't expect
  to be able to see things like if someone was holding up a you know 8 and 1 half
  by 11 paper out there on that sidewalk I wouldn't be able I would be able to see
  them and holding up they're holding up something but I won't be able to read the
  paper that wouldn't freak me out um and you know because I tend to get my contacts
  updated pretty frequently like I tend to have pretty I you know I can read that
  street sign out there whereas someone else who doesn't would be like oh that's I
  can't read that and that doesn't freak me out at all um so it is definitely the
  case that like if you stop wearing your if you stop wearing contact stop wearing
  glasses you'll just become more comfortable with like not being able to see things
  and you'll be able to live full and happy life but uh yeah yes so it's so there's
  multiple types of lasx surgery um and they basically it's so in some version of
  it they like they they shave some of it off and other versions of it they like pull
  up a flap and put something underneath it um like I think they pull they put something
  in this Gap that's clear um I don't really know how it works I think to some extent
  it's kind of a measured thing I know that there's also um like sometimes like I
  don't know if this happens in a standard eye doctor session but I know there's some
  measurements that involve basically shining a laser through the eye and then Imaging
  it on the back of the retina and it's kind of what things like if you're shooting
  a laser point then you know that it should result in a point um but if so if you
  look through it and it's diffused and it's like oh this is being refracted by this
  amount and you kind of handle it that way U there's actually a really interesting
  history there where that technology that I'm just just describing was originally
  created for spy satellites in like the cold war to like be able to focus and try
  to read you know stuff from up and low earth orbit um and it was later like after
  so like they they tapped a bunch of like astronomers to be able to like look down
  but then they classified all the technology and they and then eventually the the
  ason like hey we made this stuff can we use it for our space telescopes um and eventually
  they did and then so it's like how we do Adaptive Optics through the atmosphere
  where we shine like a sodium laser at the atmosphere and then we look at it and
  we we we distort the the lens until the thing that the the the point laser it becomes
  a point and then you say okay that's the opposite of the Distortion that's happening
  from the atmosphere and that's how we can try to image stuff through a roing atmosphere
  and get clear images and then that that technology was then flipped around and used
  to kind of do this like through the retina kind of Imaging thing yeah so that is
  less so peripheral blindness so I guess I should say that you know there's I guess
  there's a variety of sources that where that could come from from um but I believe
  that once you start talking about something like peripheral blindness you're probably
  no longer talking about something that's happening at the cornea level um there's
  all sorts of ways and disorders of the eye um that happen everything everything
  in here can go wrong um and so like glaucoma is what is a is a hardening of the
  lens and that happens often with age and that's one of those so there's surgeries
  you can if you're not squeamish you can look them up on line there's like a little
  there's videos of like eye surgeries where they go in and they break up like after
  the the lens has has hardened calcified in age um they can go in there and kind
  of like break it up and pull it out and then replace it with an artificial lens
  which is made of some kind of like you know high quality silicone stuff um and apparently
  it works out pretty well like it they it's that's one of those things that were
  like one of those the few areas of biology or we can replace something and it's
  just like oh yeah that actually works pretty pretty well like things like lasic
  is a similar thing it's like the the the physical properties that matter for this
  are relatively straightforward so we can actually control them pretty well yeah
  I promise you if you look that up someone's someone's working on it um I think I
  so like can stem cells help with insert biological issues here the answer is probably
  yes um the challenge with things like stem cells is getting them to do what you
  want them to do um so like and I'm not I'm not so and where I know that things like
  stem cells are used a lot is for places in the body that don't generally heal on
  their own um which is typically nonvascular tissue so like uh cartilage and meniscus
  and sort of like the knees and stuff like that um because there's no blood flow
  through those areas they don't tend to heal in the way that areas that have blood
  flow do because like when you if you cut your arm the healing process that happens
  is not like we send the ambulances to that area and it starts to knit up the the
  the tissue the healing happens because like stem cells and stuff just in your blood
  attached to the damag tissue and then it sort of heals itself that way so things
  like um cartilage which doesn't have blood flowing through it doesn't have that
  sort of healing property your eye does have vasculature so it does have blood running
  through it but obviously not like not that much in the clear parts so I wouldn't
  be shocked if you could find something about like repairing eye damage over time
  from things like stem cells but as far as I know there's nothing in like clinical
  practice but I'll bet they're doing all sorts of stuff to rats um cuz yeah it your
  eye is also one of those spaces that kind of like it just kind of like acrs damage
  over time and it's generally that's like why I pretty much always like wear sunglasses
  when I'm outside in the daytime CU it's like the the the blue light the ultraviolet
  light is just kind of like always damaging the biological tissues and it's very
  sensitive biological tissue and it does heal itself a little bit but especially
  once you getting into like the Nur the neural parts of it on the back um it kind
  of breaks down it sort of you know it doesn't it doesn't heal itself forever um
  or the the rate that it heals itself May can't can't keep up with the environment
  yeah yeah it it you can CH it up to being a myth uh it's like you know if you stare
  at a bright light for too long it's not great but I think that you know the TV isn't
  doing that to you this is one of those areas I think I mentioned this when we were
  doing like the mppy thing where like we have a tremendously we're very very very
  good at adapting to different light levels and so it's like you know if you look
  like if you look at your phone in the middle of the night it's like a you know it's
  like a spotlight but if you look at it when you're outside even on like a not particularly
  sunny day you can barely see the screen the screen is the same bright well see you
  have the settings there um but the screen is the same brightness either time it's
  just your light the adaptation of your lens the adaptation of your visual system
  which is a complicated thing that's not just your cornea but like all the way through
  adapts very very well so I think something like look sitting too close to a TV it's
  like we feel like TVs are very very bright but they're nothing compared to like
  being outside on a sunny day um so so yeah I don't know um yeah and I don't know
  about I don't your you know respect to your eye doctor but I don't think that that's
  a thing I don't know wear your glasses if you want to see well it's not something
  that you have to like like oh no like I'm like wearing my glasses too much like
  that's just that's that sounds insane to me um okay um okay spending a lot of time
  on the eye but I'm actually don't mind that um so that is roughly speaking most
  of like the optical stuff that's happening um in your eyeball uh like that's where
  all the refraction and stuff happens uh like the the bending of the light and the
  focusing of the image is sort of happening through those kind of like passive means
  um well passive in the level of the cornea um active and sort of mostly reflective
  in the um actual lens part um and sort of once you get past that we're kind of in
  you know the light has kind of like done what it's going to do and you know you're
  going to be yeah you're going to handle whatever the one I trying to say there um
  and the rest of it's kind of like up to the like that's the signal like the signal
  from the environmental energy from the world around you once it has passed through
  these sort of optically like sort of like non neural surfaces I guess like they
  like this none of this light is being converted into um neural activity with the
  caveat being that we're always discovering new weird ways that your body responds
  to specifically to light like we're off like recently there was something discovered
  of like oh yeah there's actually some parts of the eye that respond to Blue Light
  uh differently from the rest that is not a part of the rest of the visual system
  and it's thought to be related to like circadian rhythms and stuff like that um
  uh but yeah so yeah so once we get through here then we start getting into what
  I would say is kind of like the good stuff from a neuroscience perspective which
  is basically the retina so the Rea is this thing on the back of your eye and that
  is kind of the that is the the neural surface um that is the place where the light
  from the world is actually first absorbed and converted into neural activity and
  patterns of neural activity which are correlated with the light that comes through
  the the eye and the retina is a wacky wacky thing um let's see there a nice picture
  so the first thing we'll talk about the first thing we'll talk about is the photo
  receptors photo receptors means receptors for photons it's the part of your of the
  nervous system these are the these are the kinds of neurons whose job it is to absor
  absorb light and convert it into electrical differentials um in your yeah in your
  light in your eyes um you have two main types you have rods and cones um and generally
  speaking the rods are these they are Rod shaped um rods and cones yeah yeah um oil
  droplet I don't know what that is um so yeah rods cones um your rods are generally
  speaking they're they respond to they can absorb lower quantities of light um but
  they tend to Max they saturate very quickly um uh cones require much more light
  to operate but they can operate in a much wider range so generally speaking they
  we refer to your cones sorry your rods as the um that's like generally speaking
  your night vision stuff U and then the cones are sort of more your Precision your
  Precision information um this is also getting sort of to the depth of my anatomy
  uh knowledge like I don't this oil drop that's freaking me out like is that a I
  don't know what that's this is this is news to me um but these discs here I believe
  that's where the opsin live Ops which we've talked about before these are the ones
  actually I think they start kinked and then as the photons come in they get absorbed
  and that changes the shape of this weird chemical and the absorption of the photon
  like bumps the electron into a higher orbital or some nonsense and then that changes
  the ionic properties of the thing and then so that you know the the general status
  of how many of the opsin in the rod or cone in question have absorbed their favorite
  wavelength of photon changes the electrochemical properties of this whole system
  and so the the the the the things that are connected to notice that okay this you
  know this particular Rod is ramped up it's it's absorbed a lot of its favorite kind
  of light and so that's kind of the part of the Cascade of neural activity that that
  sort of represents your um what's it called perceptual experience um yeah in your
  I I think this varies by animal but for us our rods are tend tend to be focused
  on green um green is a good color to be sensitive to on the planet Earth we have
  a lot of it sort of floating around um and the cones or color vision tends to be
  associated with it shows here as our red green and blue but it's generally um short
  medium and long wavelength of light where blue is short wavelength red is long wavelength
  and green is somewhere in the middle um and yeah they all kind of live there and
  they have a certain distribution and da da um the other thing to notice here is
  so this is the back of the eye the light is coming this way and so you might expect
  that the part of the rods in the cone that is the most sensitive to light would
  be facing the light but that is not the way to set up it is in fact the opposite
  um and so the the cones are facing away from the light and so light has to pass
  through all of these middle layers of cells so there's you know after the photo
  receptors you have what are called the middle layers then you have what are called
  the ganglion cells and they are doing all sorts of crazy stuff they're extremely
  complex I know there's some see all these textbook pictures make it look cleaner
  than it actually is um where we um but yeah so our our vision this looks a little
  better um so our visual system is backwards it's it's the opposite of how you would
  expect it to be in and how and there are Optical consequences of the fact that everything
  that we see is being imaged through like a couple layers of dense culure um and
  that's thought to be related to when we we first crawled out of the oceans and the
  the way that the light refracts because our eyes are very close very close in density
  to seawater um so whereas they're very different from Air so if you have a a visual
  system that first evolved in an environment that is roughly the same density as
  your eye um you're going to have to have different sort of refractive strategies
  where if you have an eye that is sort of basically hold a little bubble of SE water
  in itself and then it's refracting light that's traveling through a a you know an
  air medium um so things like seapods uh octopus squids cuttlefish their eyes are
  sort of the correct way around like they have very good vision and their photo receptors
  actually face outwards um which is sort of one of those things where it's like I
  don't have too much more to say about that other than like is that weird and interesting
  um okay how we it's also kind of funny because it's like because I have given this
  lecture many times before this is always this is also always roughly the time of
  the lecture where I realized that you need an entire lecture to talk just about
  the eye and then I'm really not going to get to say much about the neural parts
  of the visual cortex um but that's okay I have then I and this is also the part
  of the lecture where I make withl that and move on um the let's see so I'll focus
  on what's important for the um for the uh ey tring stuff so this consequence of
  strange history of having sort of these like flipped around um retina uh and I'm
  not going to say too much about about what's going on out here um even it is very
  interesting and and worthy of its own discussion um but if you want to know more
  uh you know just Google or asabot about like the the middle layers of the retina
  and then the gangan cells of the retina um I'll leave it at that I guess um but
  the most important part I would say of the entire eye my favorite part of the eye
  I suppose I my favorite part rather than the most important part I guess because
  probably the most important part is the cornea but that's not very exciting but
  my favorite part of the eye is this guy right here this little divot in the back
  of the retina that is called your fobia fobia is Latin for pit um and it is an area
  that when you are pointing your eyes at something the point the thing that you're
  actually pointing at the at the object of Interest so if you look at at nice cat
  there we go uh out here that is pointing at your retina so the act of pointing my
  eyes at something is basically lining up all this refractive Machinery with this
  little pit on the back of my eye and that pit is caused phobia yeah yeah there's
  an actual one yeah there we go yeah like this guy right here so basically this is
  a part of the eye where all the the extra stuff has been kind of pushed out of the
  way to leave an unobstructed Viewpoint onto this portion of your eyeball where this
  is the by by very very wide margin the highest density of photo receptors on your
  eye so if you look at your eye so there's many many ways that your eyes are not
  cameras um but one of the most important ways is that with a camera you have an
  equal yeah look at all there's all always fun pictures here yeah this is a good
  representation of how the focusing works it's like that's you're trying to make
  make constrain the world it's not showing the refraction at the cornea um see this
  person was too inspired by the lens shape of the lens to understand how that works
  um so the the bending should be happening here and then this should be kind of like
  extra um um but the uh let's see the uh distribution so with a with a camera your
  um like the sensor on the back of the camera is roughly equal density of photosensitive
  you know silicone pits um your eye has a much much different orientation um so if
  we're specifically looking at your cones there we go like this yeah so your cones
  of the red ones this is the one that we generally think of as like when we think
  of your when when you think of your vision in terms of like how good is my vision
  you're generally considering that in terms of the the behavior and performance of
  of your cones and the distributions of cones on the back of your retina looks like
  this sort of red Spike um so this is eccentricity so zero is on the phobia and then
  plus or minus however many degrees um and you can see that like the roughly 50%
  of your photo receptors are in that ventral one Dee of your eye um and see photo
  receptor density trying to find like the the right visualization there um whatever
  uh oh yeah that's that's that's what I'm looking for yeah sure um so if you were
  to look into the back of your retina and sort of count up all of the photo receptors
  you you would find the vast vast vast majority of them like very densely packed
  in that fial central region of your eye so that when you are sort of pointing your
  eyes around um you're trying to optimize your eye movements to point this super
  high super densely packed region of photo receptors um at the object in question
  and that is also the area where they sort of that that core um that core sort of
  design fo of of the retina is sort of been sort of mitigated by sort of being by
  pushing all the the stuff out of the way um something else you might notice about
  this is the uh is the cones also so the the sorry the rods which are now these purple
  um that's your sort of that's your peripheral vision um and uh they are highly they
  like their distribution is sort of spread out to the periphery um which is thought
  to be for a lot of reasons like because the these things respond to smaller amounts
  of light they tend to respond faster so for things like peripheral cues mostly when
  when when we're thinking about a peripheral vision it's its job is not to give us
  precise sort of like I can read text levels of vision is to give us very fast information
  about stuff that's sort of coming in from the outside so that's kind of like the
  startle response and stuff like that where like things are sort of like looming
  objects from the outside trigger a behavioral response and that's often driven by
  the the rods this is also why if you're ever out in like the dead of night looking
  at the stars if you want to see something in the very like when your eyes are very
  very dark adapted the best way to see something is not to look directly at it because
  in the in sort of the middle of the night your your rods aren't really working very
  well so if you look directly at something you're going to be getting less light
  than you want so astronomers learn that if you're interested in a particular star
  the best way to see it is to look a little bit off to the side of it and then let
  your your rods do the work of giving you the information of what's coming in um
  so next time you're out in a nice starry night you will you can try that out um
  yeah you know Seven Sisters of ple or plees are sort of like one of like that's
  something I've noticed this effect a lot on because it's like a very small um sort
  of cluster of stars where if I look if I'm looking directly at it I can't make out
  the individual stars but if I look a little bit off the side I start to be able
  to count that there's seven of them and for there a lot of the challenges looking
  not directly at the thing that you care the most about which is its own kind of
  like mental game that we can sort of probably not talking too much about um so so
  um and this is also where now that I've sort of talked about some of these like
  structural aspects of the eye and the retina um can't try to be like strategic about
  what I cover with the rest of this they got do a lot of this stuff um guess I'll
  also say this now focus on the thing Okay so we've been talking a lot about the
  eyes is kind of like in terms of its passive Optical properties um you know like
  the light bends here and is absorbed by this and the kind of like these photo receptors
  there that kind of thing um but you know a lot of what we wind up doing with our
  eyes is is shaped by that um and specifically in the context of like eye movements
  because we do move our eyes we move our eyes quite a lot um this is again one of
  those things that is it's not unique to humans but I mean every animal I'd say most
  animals actually not every animal but but most animal animal do move their eyes
  um and um but humans and other primates of our general nature um Haine primates
  I believe is the name of the family that we're in not H not family whatever group
  um we have our our our nervous system is very heavily geared around our vision and
  our vision is very heavily geared towards our ability to move our eyes very rapidly
  and very precisely in order to extract in order to point those super high Acuity
  regions of our phobia at the things that we care about with very high speed and
  very high um sort of spatial accuracy um your eye each of your eyes has six muscles
  on it uh so you have two muscle this is my eye and this is the front of my eye I
  have two muscles on the top and bottom whose job it is to move the eye up and down
  and two muscles on the side that move the eye left and right and then two weirdo
  muscles at the top and bottom whose job is to rotate your eye uh sort of like around
  its Optical axis that's called torsional eye movements and it's the kind of thing
  I'll be able to show this to you when I'm wearing an eye tracker but it happens
  all the time like your eyes if you do this your eyes are rotating in their Optical
  axis not a ton um these these muscles here pass through like like the one on the
  bottom comes in from from the bottom and the one on the top passes through this
  ligamentous sling so there's like a little like ligament that like loops around
  this Superior oblique muscle that attaches to the top of your eye and allows it
  to kind of rotate that way and so a lot of what we're going to like when I put the
  eye tracker on you see the kind of the eyeball bouncing around on the screen um
  the majority those eye movements are just stabilizing my head like stabilizing against
  like the motion of my head because if I'm like moving my head around which we we
  move our heads a lot um that the opson thing like the part where the opsin absorbs
  the light is a relative slow process like it's not slow to absorb it but it's slow
  to reset like there's a process there's a biochemical process in your eye after
  that opsin has absorbed in that Photon that basically has to go through and reset
  the opsin until it can absorb light again and that's mediated by like like vitamin
  A or something like that um and it takes time so you've seen this before like if
  you look at a light then you look away you can see an after image of that light
  in your vision and that's because those opsins have absorbed photons and then it's
  going to take time for them to reset and until they do you can no longer absorb
  light from that portion of your visual field because it's sort of been maxed out
  um and so because of that there's kind of like there's like you have to be able
  to stabilize your eyeball in sort of relative to the world in order for it to have
  time to form an image from the light that's sort of making it through this complicated
  sort of process uh to make ITA to your retina and so a lot of the the purpose of
  eye movements is just to act as like stabilization of your eye in the world and
  that happens sort of simultaneously to another process of information gathering
  eye movements where I can actually move my eyes to specific places because I care
  about the information that's from that portion of my visual field um and yeah and
  we'll we'll have much more to much more to say about that when we actually are looking
  at eyeballs in in closely um yeah it's very complicated uh and very very fast very
  fast very precise your eyeballs are the fastest and most precise motor structures
  on your body um when you're doing sort of like Fast interesting Behavior where that
  could be like walking across a rocky field or something like that or like playing
  sports or you know playing video gam something that requires like very fast and
  precise visual information you're making eye movements at the rate of about you
  know one every 150 milliseconds or so at the sort of fast that's the fastest they
  can go um and that is roughly like the minimum time that it takes for the the the
  image like the the the neural architecture to sort of extract information from that
  pipeline um and so most of the times they're not making eye movements nearly that
  fast but they can go up to that speed and this can happen while your body is sort
  of like you know you're jumping and running around through the through the world
  and like as you run your head is sort of bobbing around so this there's a very complex
  Machinery of stabiliz of gay stabilization um such that sort of information gathering
  sads where a sad is the name of a fast eye movement happen sort of on top of those
  stabilization mechanisms that are sort of allowing your eye to to be still long
  enough to absorb the information necessary to to form an image uh also so there's
  a lot of a lot of the field of vision Vision like visual neuroscience and stuff
  like that involves looking at Illusions um and learning about what the Illusions
  say about our visual system um and so like for example when you were asking about
  like peripheral vision it's like oh that's happening at this other part of the um
  of the eye not the cornia uh there are similarly uh illusions that we can distribute
  to different parts of the visual system so one of them which you may have seen yeah
  this one always messes me up severely oops not that one no no no so this is called
  a Herman grid um which if you look at it you'll probably be seeing little ghosty
  black dots so when you look at a DOT it's white the dots are all white but the ones
  that you're not looking at are going to be a different color um realize similarly
  this is another one of those Classics where all the intersections are white I promise
  you they're all white but if you look at them you'll probably see little shadowy
  ghosty shapes in the corners of the other ones for a while some of the some one
  one generation of MacBook had this effect on the keyboard um but I think they probably
  fixed that um and yeah and this is basically caused by uh there we go this one messes
  me up come on okay so it's not why don't we have these things yeah so 1 2 3 4 5
  6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 um this one has the effect that you cannot come
  on I don't know if it works with the artifact there but like uh if you just Google
  Herman grid 12 dots like this is one of the things like it's hard to display these
  things on a screen because they don't always work out but um you can't see all of
  them at once because of basically interactions with your gangan cells which have
  gangan Retina cells um this is a layer that I'm not I just don't have the there's
  a lot this is a layer that I just can't quite get to the the gangan cells have to
  do with like the pooling that happens um where it's kind of like it's this this
  layer where the the the the photo receptors from the different are kind of they
  get pulled together and sort of respond like you know they wind up becoming one
  um uh what's it called a nerve coming off the the back of your retina so like that's
  an area where in the central of your visual field like at that fobia region it's
  almost a onetoone mapping where almost every photo receptor has a an axon coming
  down and going back through your optic nerve um but around the periphery the the
  the signals from multiple receptors are they get pulled together and so a lot of
  these effects happen because of like the interactions from in that because if you're
  looking at the the the dot in question you see it correctly but then the periphery
  is doing pooling over that region of the retinal field so the whiteness of this
  dot gets sort of like mixed in with the darkness of the surrounding regions and
  so your your brain sort of interprets it as being a different color than it is and
  then when you move your eye towards it now it looks white but the thing you were
  looking at has this other effect and and let's see if this side is still running
  so fobia Shader toy and this is one of my favorite versions of that FIA detector
  so if it's working for me so every one of these crosses is rotating the entire time
  but if you're looking at it tell me if this is working from your perspective like
  only the part that you're looking at should have rotation and the rest of them look
  still is that working yeah that's because that's because of your phobia and because
  your phobia is so much more sensitive than the other if you just Google um phobia
  detector Shader toy you'll find this and it looks better on your screen um but it's
  one of these areas where like your your your ability to to identify the the motion
  is this is like this is designed to be kind of like at your your your threshold
  of your ability to do it and so the only portion of the screen where you can actually
  see um the motion is at that fobal place so the effect is a very strange like as
  you look around it will look like there's only like a little patch of it that's
  rotating and that that patch will follow wherever you choose to point your eyes
  um it's very yeah someday whoever is hting this site we'll stop hosting it and it
  be sad um oh but also that's funny the first time I found this is like I couldn't
  interpret the code but now I'm better at that so I'm like oh I can actually I know
  how to I can pull this into my own life and have more control over it um yeah else
  I wanted to show here yeah so the point is that your vision is complicated and it's
  complicated before it even hits your brain um there is a sort of interesting when
  I talked at some point about like periperal versus central nervous system I mentioned
  the retina or I I intended to mention the retina as kind of like a gray area there
  um because there is very easy to discuss like when you're talking about often times
  you talk about Central versus peripheral nervous system you're talking about in
  the context of like where which part of your eye which part is doing processing
  which part is just sort of like funneling the information either to or from the
  central nervous system and the retina is one of those cases where like it would
  really be hard to argue that what's happening in this sort of like middle layers
  of the retina wouldn't count as processing and a lot CU those the effects I just
  showed you those those Illusions I just showed you those are all at that sort of
  like those Illusions happen before the light and the neural activity driven by the
  Light ever leaves your eye um oh another visual effect oh just look up your blind
  spot too just just do me a favor and just pretend like I did that in class just
  look up just Google Blind Spot demo and then do the thing where like you learn how
  to like find the blind spot where your thumb disappears and then you know just have
  it have feelings about that um but yeah so the eye is a very complicated thing and
  the eyeball itself is there's a lot going on there um and we're going to talk a
  little I'll find I'll find time to talk more about the kind of the the primary visual
  cortex um layer of things which is typically where when we think about like visual
  processing we're thinking about something that's happening in the brain and sort
  of like and there is you know a good chunk of our brain is devoted to Vision um
  and in this sort of visual cortex area um roughly 50% of the visual cortex is devoted
  towards that Central one degree of your PO of your phobia your phobia by the way
  is about the size of your thumbnail at arms length so about 50% of your visual cor
  50% of your photo receptors and 50% of your visual cortex are devoted to processing
  this much of your visual field so about 1% of your visual field is about 50% about
  50% of your architecture of your visual system is devoted to that 1% of your visual
  field and that kind of is to make the point that it's the ability to move the eyes
  as precisely as we do that gives them the ability to operate and to guide our motor
  Behavior as effectively as as it can and that is the end of the class uh next Wednesday
  I will come in with

  text: okay hello hello hello hi all right Let's do let's do today so um I guess
    spring break is next week so that's nice uh I once again standing here before
    you as a liar and a generally untrustworthy person because I said I was going
    to have the stuff for this done by today um I don't I you know hit some it's like
    I I I once again did the thing of making an assignment that requires technical
    capacity that did not exist at the time that I made the assignment um so I'll
    give you a quick update on that um but I should have something I I'll I'll try
    to have something done by Wednesday and then just push all the deadlines out um
    so that kind of like things will kind of be spread out over the end of the you
    know the rest next of the couple weeks and um yeah you should all be set up for
    it so uh the content of the lecture today is going to be about vision and eyeballs
    and sort of how that stuff generally Works we've covered it a little bit in the
    kind of like the overview stuff at the beginning of the semester but now we're
    going to go a little more in depth of that stuff so some things that I sort of
    probably hit pretty fast in passing I'm going to hit still pretty fast in passing
    but at a slightly slower rate um but yeah and then so next Wednesday so to tomorrow
    class uh Wednesday class um I will bring in an eye tracker and we'll do kind of
    an eye tracking demo um similar to the one I did with the motion capture but less
    involved because it's you know all the cameras in that process are attached to
    my head so it's a little bit easier to set up um and then yeah then we'll have
    spring break and we'll kind of go over that and blah BL the rest of the class
    uh in quick let's see how much time I want to do this I'll go I think I'll I'll
    I'll do it uh I'll just give a quick update on kind of the you know my assignment
    for the course of making sense of all your guys' wacky nonsense uh so the so very
    quickly the the the technical side of the thing I need to do um there you go yeah
    so the the main technical challenge here is that I I I want to do these exam chats
    which I talked about last week but a lot of youall weren't here so I'll say it
    again

  text: um is basically to sort of create some chat spaces in the server uh where
    the bot has been kind of uh The Prompt of the bot has been doped with the content
    of the lecture that I've been giving and recording and putting online um and then
    have kind of like two forms of that chat set up one of which is sort of designed
    to work with you kind of grinding through whatever your chosen topic was and trying
    to attach the concepts that we've been talking about in terms of like the sort
    of philosophy of science aspects of like empirical measurement and sort of like
    what's the you know what's actually being recorded from the environment and stuff
    like that um and sort of connecting those thoughts to the topic that you have
    chosen um and then the other version of that will be specifically tuned to helping
    you come up with your poster proposal number two um which is basically just kind
    of an outline sort of schematized form of your paper that says this is my paper
    this is the methods you know this is the intro methods results discussion sort
    of in you know two sentences or less about the paper that I've chosen um and then
    that will be kind of the content of the poster that you're actually sort of submitting
    um which so yeah uh and then the the poster draft wants to be due um the week
    after spring break and I'll I'll do trying to figure out where probably in here
    right now it doesn't make sense I don't know um I'll have some time in class to
    kind of like you know go over what you have and sort of answer questions and things
    like that um the draft is not the final of the not the final form of it it's sort
    of the intention is that this is it's it is a completed poster which if you were
    forced to you could print and sort of talk about um but we're intentionally going
    to give some space to that so that you can have time to kind of go over it with
    people around you and sort of like you know have a couple couple couple opportunities
    to kind of like try to work through it with your classmates it's kind of be like
    oh wait I actually wish this was this way that way and the other so that by the
    time we actually submit the thing to be uploaded and printed on March 25th uh
    you're about ready for it because yeah once it's printed it just exists and so
    you can't it's good to have some opportunities to edit there um so yeah so the
    technical side of that is the part of uh you know condensing down the lectures
    into a form that can fit into the prompt of an AI bot um which just by way of
    sort of like passive education I'll just point out where that's happening in the
    the course repository so because it's kind of like so at this point I think there's
    sixish recorded

  text: lectures Each of which is like somewhere between an hour to an hour and a
    half long um so that's a lot of just words it's a lot of you know human saying
    words and it's relatively easy at this point in history and my own personal development
    to pull the content like the pull the the words that were spoken in a in a video
    on YouTube into a text based format um but there's a couple challenges there because
    uh for the one thing it's just so many work like the the number of words that
    you say when speaking for an hour and a half is much much higher than the actual
    meaningful content that you're expressing um and also when you speak out loud
    you are not generally speaking grammatically like if you wrote down the words
    that I'm speaking which I know because I've been looking at that it sounds like
    a person having a stroke like it's not like we feel like we're speaking in grammatical
    form sentences but we're not like and so uh I've been writing some sort of AI
    code sort of sloppy by my own personal standards but don't does the job um that
    goes through and firsts does this kind of thing so takes takes the content chunks
    it out into 10-minute sections and then just sends it to an AI that says clean
    this up and remove all the um and a and make it into grammatical sentences and
    stuff like that this code is effectively the same thing as copy pasting things
    into the Discord bot um it's just happens in an automated way so if I give an
    hourlong lecture that's chunked into 10 minute chunks that's six total chunks
    and so that's this just runs in a loop and does that um so it takes the lectures
    cleans them up and then this is the part that's not quite actually not the first
    part is it pulls it from YouTube um then it this is the part where I'm going to
    take those chunks and then sort of boil them down into kind of like outline formats
    at which point will have been condensed down to the point that they can be kind
    of included in a bot chat and sort of sort of the idea is that having a conversation
    with the bot that has been prompted by all this stuff will be kind of like you
    know a a crappy simulation of what it would be like if I was sitting down and
    working through this sort of you know one-on-one um which I would love to do but
    uh the realities of numbers sort of make that difficult um so if you're curious
    about that you can look in here in the court repo uh this lecture transcripts
    has got kind of the I guess was it cleaned is the probably yeah what is that right
    I don't know anyways but it's it's a lot of words these are all the words I've
    said to you um yeah so so that's ongoing uh and then the other ECT of that of

  text: exam chats is that um I'll be asking you to sort of pull in the uh the profiles
    that have been kind of getting extracted about you so I've we talked about this
    before but like uh the lecture they think the the chats that you've been having
    with the bot have been you know part of this process is that I periodically scraped
    through the server pull those out and then try to again pull out all the chats
    that you've had smush them together and shove them into the bot and say what is
    this person interested in what is their sort of focus what should they be what
    are some things they might want to look at and think about and da da da so that
    has also been ongoing um the latest of that which I think I'm I'm not this one
    I'm not going to go into um but I I again put a zip file of the latest um sort
    of server wide analyses come on Discord um in the Discord Channel um except this
    one now has two forms there's it's uh like the zip file has two two folders in
    it one of which the student profiles for each of you are based off of only your
    chats from the assignments category um so like the like the ones you've been specifically
    prompted to do um and the other one uses all all of the chats that you've had
    total so every chat that you participated in is is part of it um where is it yeah
    links and resources uh This Server scrape checkpoints and this last one here as
    yeah these two things in it and again these are exactly the same from the exact
    same period time which is everything that happened before about like 8:00 a.m.
    this morning um and that's one that says profiles from all channels your profile
    in there is based off your every chat that has every every chat that has your
    ID in it and any place um is included there so all the class assignments and stuff
    like that uh profiles from assignments Channel only is all the chats that you've
    had that are in the assignments wait is it assignments Channel or category how
    did I do that yeah in the assment category I although I just realized now I may
    have done that wrong so it might they might both have all of you might have everything
    in it because I did a filter but I think I might have been filtering by Channel
    instead of category so it may not have worked so um that's an easy fix but uh
    yeah I'm not going to dig into that but if you want to go in there and kind of
    like compare what's going on there if they're exactly the same then I know that
    I screwed that up um and but if they're different um part of the the

    to be sort of pulling in that profile and sort of copy pasting it into the chat
    so that you know you not starting from scratch so that's going to be one of those
    things where like I'll show you where the high water mark is for that and you
    can kind of choose how you want to take that file and edit it and sort of delete
    things you don't think are appropriate add things you think are appropriate um
    and so I'll probably make both of these format available to you and you kind of
    mix and match for yourself and kind of like you can decide how you want to prompt
    the bot to know who you are um or if you just don't think it's useful just just
    don't do it all and then you have to explain it explain yourself again um okay
    any questions about that make sense roughly cool okay great well let's talk about
    eyeballs eh um so eyeballs they live on your face the average human has slightly
    less than two and they're generally very useful things great um this is one of
    those lectur that like I've given this lecture in various formats many many times
    and I've never really come up with like my personal favorite way of doing it it's
    so this is just kind of like a list of things I want to make sure to hit um and
    I think let's start is this going to want to be a combination of like drawing
    and stuff on the screen so yeah okay let's do this okay so we spent so we talked
    a little bit about Vision in the start of the class but we we spent the majority
    of the time since then talking about motor control uh motor control is sort of
    moving in the world so roughly speaking um anything that involves like muscles
    and sort of the generation of force that moves Mass connected to your body uh
    is under the category of motor control um motor like motion and uh the and you
    know good thing to be able to do um I think my particular area of expertise in
    studying neuroscience and neural control of movement is in

  text: what is generally called perceptual motor control um where the O in the middle
    means it's sort of perceptual SL motor so it's kind of like the the connection
    between the perceptual systems of the body and the motor systems of the body um
    and those are two things that are often uh studied to Great you know effect in
    isolation of each other um but there's in sort of natural behavior especially
    um they're not really separable in the same kind of way Like to Move Your Body
    effectively in a complex and dynamic World requires you to have good perceptual
    information about that world so knowing where things are is a very important component
    of planning your motions and your Mo your movements out effectively um and vision
    is a very uh sort of a classic uh sense not every animal uses Vision um entirely
    but sort of as as not every not every animal has Vision as core to their nervous
    system as we do but it is a very classic um environmental energy to be tapped
    into um we're going to talk about kind of The evolutionary elements of that at
    some at the later point in the semester I don't know what I'm trying to do here
    um but it's basically been around for as long as there have been microbes or of
    the ability to absorb photons from the world and determine sort of dark areas
    from Bright areas is a thing that even single- celled organisms do sort of like
    the rise up to the top of the pool of water in the daytime and drop down at night
    and that type of thing so let's take a quick trip through the main sort of Pathways
    of the perceptual system and the yeah so let's start with light itself um so light
    is covered by like the study of light is generally covered under the field of
    Optics um where Optics is kind of the the part of physics that involves with photons
    and sort of refractions and lenses and stuff like that historically the first
    sort of the origins of the study of Optics as a specific um field um it's generally
    attributed to iel hyam uh who was 7th Century Century uh modern Iraq um wasn't
    called Iraq back then but it was a um he was a scholar in the seventh seventh
    to n9th Century I can't remember exactly when um but he was uh the first person
    to kind of like start thinking about light specifically and start thinking specifically
    about light in the context of like light is the thing that

    pinhole camera so The Story Goes that he pinhole camera andhole camera I Alam
    yeah so The Story Goes that he was in his tent in the bright bright sun and notice
    that with if there was a pinhole prick in the in the walls of one of these otherwise
    opaque uh walls of the tent um you could see an image of the world projected onto
    the other side of the of the tent this was and this is known as a holiday obscura
    or a pinhole camera this was not the first time in history that this sort of optical
    effect was discovered I think the original reference of it was in like some sort
    of ancient Chinese um text uh but it wasn't at that time it was sort of presented
    at that point time is like um like hey here's this weird thing that happens in
    less of a sort of like a looking into like there was less of an understanding
    of like why that happened and sort of what's going on it sort of like a documentation
    of a strange Optical effect more than a um the beginning of a deep dive into the
    mathematics behind Optics soam wrote the book of Optics which we're going to come
    back to um wherein he wrote like a very long Treatise on the study of light and
    specifically the study of how it interacts with our visual system and including
    some very precient um well not preent just accurate uh anatomical models of the
    of the early visual system and these thoughts were sort of roughly lost for about
    you know not Lo but they they did not make it into Europe for about 5 to 600 years
    um when dayart came along and translated a bunch of stuff um and yeah so like
    the main so the main idea here was kind of this discovery of light as a thing
    that exists sort of independently in nature obviously people had known that light
    exists um but it wasn't the kind of thing that had been specifically studied as
    like an independent natural entity and the first thing that he was doing in addition
    to kind of this nice anatomical work was just sort of mapping out the basic geometries
    of how what happens if you have this sort of stuff that travels in straight lines
    and figuring out things like you know why the if you in this pinhole camera situation
    why you have the uh the images show up inverted on the project image and it's

  text: all this nice sort of you know if the light that's coming from the Sun bouncing
    off the top of the Minette sort of travels down to that point TR point to the
    bottom travels up to that point that's how you get the kind of inverted image
    there um and you'll see this image a lot sort of like projection in the eye yeah
    this is sort of of classic textbook stuff where you're presenting the imagees
    sort of like backward like upside down on the retina which is true but it's sort
    of I think it kind of misses some of the point but that's fine um so one of the
    interesting things one of like the one of I think one of the reasons why this
    guy is sort of considered to be like one of the sort of Scholars of History was
    he did a lot of that early work on Optics and like he kind of hit most of the
    major points like pretty pretty straight off the bat um and particularly in kind
    of the idea you know just sort of project in the projective geometry oh it's this
    one I already have up oh yeah well B2 projected yeah so like this is the kind
    of um epipolar geometry that that is used behind that motion capture thing and
    dra through the 3D projection all that kind of stuff um and these are sort of
    represent these are um like tutorial images from like modern software packages
    on how to do computer vision and most of the math for this was kind of worked
    out way back then um the main thing that he didn't have the main thing that he
    couldn't quite figure out um was refraction and the way that light can so he understood
    that light travels in straight lines but he didn't really understand how lenses
    worked and so when you look if you look at some of these uh images of the eye
    come on man anyways um a lot of the labels and stuff that happen in here are accurate
    to this day um except the one thing that he kind of had wacky going on was in
    the the lens of the eye he believed that there was a little demon that lived and
    sort of bent the light to make it make sense not to say that he believed that
    there were demons living in your eyes but it was sort of like a I think I've already
    said this in this class but like it was kind of like a placeholder of like I'm
    not sure what's happening in

  text: here so I understand that the straight line math doesn't work out because
    your eyes are too small to do that kind of projection um so it probably has to
    do with this little thing right here but I don't really understand how that part
    Works um and that kind of projective geometry that kind of um refraction stuff
    uh I don't quite know the the specific history there but um you know that was
    worked out much later I suppose I should also mention just in the history of things
    that um originally we believed that light before we really understood light as
    kind of this environmental thing Vision was sort of conceived of as something
    that was emitted from your face like when you look at stuff it's called emission
    Theory um that they thought that there was like sort of these like beams of not
    light but beams of something that sort of shot out out of your face when you looked
    at stuff and that was how you received the sensory information from the world
    so in the same sense way that you sort of reach out with your limbs to touch things
    they thought that there was some kind of like invisible substance that was being
    projected from your eyes and that stuff touching things was how you uh perceived
    the world and that was the domly for a long time and sort of in like Black Death
    times they would do things like cover people's eyes when they were sick because
    they didn't they knew that like you don't want to touch sick people because that
    will you know transmit disease so they thought it would cover the eyes to sort
    of make sure that you don't get hit with the eye lasers um anyways uh yeah and
    then yeah anys whatever so so that's kind of yeah the old school Optics and these
    days like if you if you go to a if you take an Optics course and I think that'll
    be mechanical no I don't know what kind of engineering that would be it would
    be in the engineering department but I'm not sure who probably physics maybe Proby
    physics teaches Optics um you'll learn about what's called Snell's law which Snell's
    law tells us uh all the things that can happen when light hits a surface or basically
    as light is coming in has wavelengths and stuff like that and when it hits a surface
    it will either transmit go straight through it be absorbed into the material itself
    or reflect so transmission absorption reflection those are the three things that
    light can do when it hits a surface and every surface in the world uh will

  text: have properties uh related to this and if it is transmitted transmission also
    has a refraction angle so for sometime sometimes when light pass it through a
    surface it goes straight through and for other surfaces it will refract by a certain
    amount and the the refraction angle is is dependent on the angle that it that
    the hits the surface as well as like the index of refraction which is just sort
    of a a property that things have so so prop so substances like glass have a very
    low index of refraction so when you look straight through it not much happens
    um other Sur so you know if you have something like a lens then you have refractive
    aspects that sort of bend the light to the point where it focuses so if you hit
    if it's coming straight on it goes straight through if it's coming in from an
    angle it's refracted in like that and so that's basically how a lens can focus
    light and on things and that's how cameras work that's how glasses work all that
    kind of stuff so this is sort of the snail's law Optics of what's happening when
    the light from the world first hits your eye um so let's do this sure yeah nice
    so this is an eyeball or it's a picture of an eyeball and we can use this to kind
    stuff out um so this is very much not to scale um but does the job so this is
    a side view of your eyeball and this thick part here which this looks very thick
    to me I don't know if there's I don't know how accurate that is but um it could
    be um so this thick part out here is called the cornea the cornea is a clear surface
    on the the outside of your eye when you're looking at somebody's eyes you
- dur: 180.0
  end: 1980.0
  start: 1800.0
  text: are looking at their corneas because that's the outermost surface um and it
    is you know again I don't know if it's proportionally this thick um but it is
    it is thick and it does have refractive properties and when light is coming in
    from the world uh the first thing that it hits is the cornea and so the majority
    of the refraction that happens on your eye that sort of focuses the image on the
    back of your retina is happening passively by the the refractive properties of
    the cornea um that yeah and we'll we'll come back to that and look for a better
    picture of this next part um actually yeah this is the better picture open there
    you go so this is the cornea this this proportionality looks closer to me there
    is kind of a an empty space that is there's there's a lot of fluid filled cap
    cavities in your eye um filled with something called the aquous humor which is
    basically like a a clear gelatinous like fluid liquid type of thing um and then
    this part so the the light hits your cornea is refracted in numbers wise the number
    I remember is about 80% of the refraction happens at the cornea level um and then
    Bas in that that refraction happens the sell's lothing happens every time light
    hits a surface that is a different density from the one that it's currently traveling
    through so light is not refracting when it's traveling through air other than
    when it's sort of bouncing off of uh sort of water molecules that are suspended
    in the air which is why the sky is blue as a whole other conversation um but for
    our purposes we can assume that like the refraction process will happen every
    time there's a boundary between sort of transmissive fluid of one density over
    here to a different density over here so that first refraction Point happens at
    end of the cornea and then it sort of goes through this empty sort of gets into
    this opening here this opening is called your pupil perhaps you've heard of it
    um so your pupil is one of these nice things that like it's not it doesn't have
    an independent existence it's basically the name that we give to a void of space
    uh your pupil is basically the opening

    body's finest sphincters um whose job is basically to open and close to let through
    different amounts of light relative to the environment that you're in and it's
    basically it there's a lot of interesting reflexes that happen there um the main
    one that you probably think about is that when you're in a bright when you're
    a very bright room your pupil constricts which lets through less light when you're
    in a darker setting your people expands which let do more light which has a lot
    of sort of optical properties there um I think that's related to like the aperture
    like if you're a photography person it's related to the aperture um I'm not going
    to say too much about that there are other there's other things that happen your
    I your your pupil um dilation is affected by other aspects of your physiology
    um sort of like things like fear and relaxation and stuff like that um like if
    you get startled they surprised like an adrenaline Burse will constrict your pupils
    um and there's a lot of literature studying pupilometry I think too much literature
    studying pupilometry I think it's one of those things and we'll talk about this
    in the context of the eye tracker uh on Wednesday um it's one of these things
    where I think that because the p because it's fair easy to measure the pupil size
    from an eye tracker and because you can measure that you can look at that signal
    independently of the actual context that it's happening in I think there's just
    sort of like a soci sociological effect for there's people wind up studying like
    the pupilometry and the effects of like different emotional states and different
    stimuli on your pupil side I think that is studied way way too much and there's
    way way too much literature on that mostly because it is relatively easy to study
    so the field kind of gets flooded with studies that use that kind of that type
    of an outcome so it's one of those cases where it's like I'm not saying no we
    shouldn't study it but I am saying that if you were to go out and start looking
    at it tracking looking at papers on ey tracking you would find a lot of papers
    about pupilometry and you'll be forgiven for thinking wow this is the most important
    thing to think about here um but resist that feeling um it is not I think it's

    and scattering off of everything in the world and as that light sort of bounces
    it is it it becomes coupled with the things that it's bouncing off of um if you
    really want to dig into the quantum aspects of it they they do show up here like
    when light bounces off of an object of a given color that that color is absorbed
    so the light that comes off of it so like that that wall back there is green then
    when the light bounces off of it all of the red wavelengths are absorbed and the
    stuff that comes off of it is green assuming that the light in the environment
    is generally white which usually is um broad spectrum um then the light that's
    sort of bouncing into my retina from that part of the room has had all the red
    wavelength sucked out of it and so the light that comes in is only within the
    wavelength band that corresponds to like that kind of bluish greenish color of
    that back wall and so that's that's jumping ahead a bit but so the light comes
    through it refracts some of it makes it through this people opening um yeah oous
    humor there uh humor is another one of those like medieval science terms like
    talk about your humors and balance stuff like that so this is from that sort of
    era um and then once the light makes it to your your pupil it hits the second
    main refractory sort of substance in your eye uh which is the lens um and the
    lens is a little it's a it's a lens it looks like a little lens made out of sort
    of a clear structural sort of biological it's not a goop because the the aquous
    humor is a goop the lens is like an object like a more of a it has its own sort
    of but it's like it's um it's elastic and clear and sort of oblong in that way
    and it is also actively controlled like your your your brain at some level um
    is controlling how much it should compress uh this this lens it has these this
    is saying that these are ligaments um which I I believe it there are also muscles
    attached um and the muscles pull the lens to different shapes and the different
    shapes have different refractive indexes so if it's like this it refracts more
    and then you pull it more elongo elongated and it refracts less and all of these

    of your eyes where in Focus means that you can tell the difference between you
    know thin lines and stuff like that um that Focus implies that that focal point
    of the light is on your retina and so your brain using some kind of using a variety
    of complex mechanisms is going to try to uh stretch and bend this lens structure
    in order to put that focal point on the back of your your retina how does it know
    when things are in Focus how does it control it what are the feedback loops these
    are all great questions that I can guess at but I don't really know sort of like
    we're sort of at my depth with some of this ey physiology stuff um it's also the
    case that uh so and it's also this is something that you can control yourself
    so if you're um I think this might one of those things like wiggling your ears
    where not everybody can actually do it on their own but you can at least try and
    so if you just like look at something and kind of like fuzz it out like if you
    if you look at an object and there's kind of like you know a flex whatever muscle
    you have to flex to make that thing go in and out of focus you are controlling
    your lens when that's happening that's that's the thing that you're flexing is
    is your lens um um so you know um it also many of you including me are probably
    wearing some sort of corrective lenses so glasses contacts something like that
    um because you might say and you might even be able to like find some some shyy
    medical stuff online suggesting that you need to that you can you can exercise
    the lens muscle and then you don't you won't need glasses anymore um that is not
    actually true um because of that sort of 80/20 division of labor there um because
    remember like 80% of the refraction is happening at the cornea level um and only
    sort of the the the length is only doing just a little bit more of that so you're
    not going to be able to actively correct for the whole thing being out of whack
    um or it's like amblyopia sort of like your ey is like too oblong so if you're
    far sided too oblong if you're near sided it to whatever that sh is um that shape
    is um and so the corrective lenses that you have is basically augmenting the corneus
    so if you're in contacts you're basically putting another layer on top of it uh
    or if you're in glasses you're putting another lens out here to to bend the light
    a little bit before it even hits the retina so that the the resting state of this

    below me um and but yeah it's like the the the context sit on top of it it's got
    some kind of a suction thing and so it like it pulls the cornea into like a slightly
    different shape to to help some it's it's changing the passive refractive properties

    then like you wake up it's wacky I don't know yeah yeah yeah it's like hard hard
    contact lenses was we we've got past that as a technology but that was for a while
    like contact lenses were hard glass things you have a question slightly bigger
    yes larger like more stronger okay okay yeah so I think a stigmatism is kind so
    because like near sided and farsighted it has to do with like the overall eyeball

    it's the corne shap yeah yeah and so the thing of like like the shaping that happens

    like every time I went to the doctor until I hit like 25 or something like that
    and then I've been at the same prescription for you know since then um we also
    have very different perspectives on how much focus and precision we expect from
    our vision so we all know people at least I know people you may be one of these
    people who like has glasses but doesn't wear them and they're like I can yeah
    I can tell immediately yeah and so what will happen is if you it's like it's like

    look I was looking I was like oh yeah it's like out there by that sign that says
    you know speed limit is 25 and he was just like you can see that like because
    you know we we all have a distance that we don't expect to be able to see things
    like if someone was holding up a you know 8 and 1 half by 11 paper out there on
    that sidewalk I wouldn't be able I would be able to see them and holding up they're
    holding up something but I won't be able to read the paper that wouldn't freak
    me out um and you know because I tend to get my contacts updated pretty frequently
    like I tend to have pretty I you know I can read that street sign out there whereas
    someone else who doesn't would be like oh that's I can't read that and that doesn't
    freak me out at all um so it is definitely the case that like if you stop wearing
    your if you stop wearing contact stop wearing glasses you'll just become more
    comfortable with like not being able to see things and you'll be able to live
    full and happy life but uh yeah yes so it's so there's multiple types of lasx

    shave some of it off and other versions of it they like pull up a flap and put

    that's clear um I don't really know how it works I think to some extent it's kind
    of a measured thing I know that there's also um like sometimes like I don't know
    if this happens in a standard eye doctor session but I know there's some measurements
    that involve basically shining a laser through the eye and then Imaging it on
    the back of the retina and it's kind of what things like if you're shooting a
    laser point then you know that it should result in a point um but if so if you
    look through it and it's diffused and it's like oh this is being refracted by
    this amount and you kind of handle it that way U there's actually a really interesting

    stuff can we use it for our space telescopes um and eventually they did and then
    so it's like how we do Adaptive Optics through the atmosphere where we shine like
    a sodium laser at the atmosphere and then we look at it and we we we distort the
    the lens until the thing that the the the point laser it becomes a point and then
    you say okay that's the opposite of the Distortion that's happening from the atmosphere
    and that's how we can try to image stuff through a roing atmosphere and get clear
    images and then that that technology was then flipped around and used to kind
    of do this like through the retina kind of Imaging thing yeah so that is less
    so peripheral blindness so I guess I should say that you know there's I guess
    there's a variety of sources that where that could come from from um but I believe
    that once you start talking about something like peripheral blindness you're probably
    no longer talking about something that's happening at the cornea level um there's
    all sorts of ways and disorders of the eye um that happen everything everything
    in here can go wrong um and so like glaucoma is what is a is a hardening of the
    lens and that happens often with age and that's one of those so there's surgeries
    you can if you're not squeamish you can look them up on line there's like a little
    there's videos of like eye surgeries where they go in and they break up like after
    the the lens has has hardened calcified in age um they can go in there and kind
    of like break it up and pull it out and then replace it with an artificial lens
    which is made of some kind of like you know high quality silicone stuff um and
    apparently it works out pretty well like it they it's that's one of those things

    like and I'm not I'm not so and where I know that things like stem cells are used
    a lot is for places in the body that don't generally heal on their own um which
    is typically nonvascular tissue so like uh cartilage and meniscus and sort of
    like the knees and stuff like that um because there's no blood flow through those
    areas they don't tend to heal in the way that areas that have blood flow do because
    like when you if you cut your arm the healing process that happens is not like
    we send the ambulances to that area and it starts to knit up the the the tissue
    the healing happens because like stem cells and stuff just in your blood attached
    to the damag tissue and then it sort of heals itself that way so things like um
    cartilage which doesn't have blood flowing through it doesn't have that sort of
    healing property your eye does have vasculature so it does have blood running
    through it but obviously not like not that much in the clear parts so I wouldn't
    be shocked if you could find something about like repairing eye damage over time
    from things like stem cells but as far as I know there's nothing in like clinical
    practice but I'll bet they're doing all sorts of stuff to rats um cuz yeah it
    your eye is also one of those spaces that kind of like it just kind of like acrs
    damage over time and it's generally that's like why I pretty much always like
    wear sunglasses when I'm outside in the daytime CU it's like the the the blue
    light the ultraviolet light is just kind of like always damaging the biological
    tissues and it's very sensitive biological tissue and it does heal itself a little
    bit but especially once you getting into like the Nur the neural parts of it on
    the back um it kind of breaks down it sort of you know it doesn't it doesn't heal
    itself forever um or the the rate that it heals itself May can't can't keep up
    with the environment yeah yeah it it you can CH it up to being a myth uh it's
    like you know if you stare at a bright light for too long it's not great but I
    think that you know the TV isn't doing that to you this is one of those areas
    I think I mentioned this when we were doing like the mppy thing where like we
    have a tremendously we're very very very good at adapting to different light levels
    and so it's like you know if you look like if you look at your phone in the middle
    of the night it's like a you know it's like a spotlight but if you look at it
    when you're outside even on like a not particularly sunny day you can barely see
    the screen the screen is the same bright well see you have the settings

    light the adaptation of your lens the adaptation of your visual system which is
    a complicated thing that's not just your cornea but like all the way through adapts
    very very well so I think something like look sitting too close to a TV it's like
    we feel like TVs are very very bright but they're nothing compared to like being
    outside on a sunny day um so so yeah I don't know um yeah and I don't know about
    I don't your you know respect to your eye doctor but I don't think that that's
    a thing I don't know wear your glasses if you want to see well it's not something
    that you have to like like oh no like I'm like wearing my glasses too much like
    that's just that's that sounds insane to me um okay um okay spending a lot of
    time on the eye but I'm actually don't mind that um so that is roughly speaking
    most of like the optical stuff that's happening um in your eyeball uh like that's
    where all the refraction and stuff happens uh like the the bending of the light
    and the focusing of the image is sort of happening through those kind of like
    passive means um well passive in the level of the cornea um active and sort of
    mostly reflective in the um actual lens part um and sort of once you get past
    that we're kind of in you know the light has kind of like done what it's going
    to do and you know you're going to be yeah you're going to handle whatever the
    one I trying to say there um and the rest of it's kind of like up to the like
    that's the signal like the signal from the environmental energy from the world
    around you once it has passed through these sort of optically like sort of like
    non neural surfaces I guess like they like this none of this light is being converted
    into um neural activity with the caveat being that we're always discovering new
    weird ways that your body responds to specifically to light like we're off like
    recently there was something discovered of like oh yeah there's actually some
    parts of the eye that respond to Blue Light uh differently from the rest that
    is not a part of the rest of the visual system and it's thought to be related
    to like circadian rhythms and stuff like that um uh but yeah so yeah so once we
    get through here then we start getting into what I would say is kind of like the
    good stuff from a neuroscience perspective which is basically the retina so the

    the eye and the retina is a wacky wacky thing um let's see there a nice picture
    so the first thing we'll talk about the first thing we'll talk about is the photo
    receptors photo receptors means receptors for photons it's the part of your of
    the nervous system these are the these are the kinds of neurons whose job it is
    to absor absorb light and convert it into electrical differentials um in your
    yeah in your light in your eyes um you have two main types you have rods and cones
    um and generally speaking the rods are these they are Rod shaped um rods and cones
    yeah yeah um oil droplet I don't know what that is um so yeah rods cones um your
    rods are generally speaking they're they respond to they can absorb lower quantities
    of light um but they tend to Max they saturate very quickly um uh cones require
    much more light to operate but they can operate in a much wider range so generally
    speaking they we refer to your cones sorry your rods as the um that's like generally
    speaking your night vision stuff U and then the cones are sort of more your Precision
    your Precision information um this is also getting sort of to the depth of my
    anatomy uh knowledge like I don't this oil drop that's freaking me out like is
    that a I don't know what that's this is this is news to me um but these discs
    here I believe that's where the opsin live Ops which we've talked about before
    these are the ones actually I think they start kinked and then as the photons
    come in they get absorbed and that changes the shape of this weird chemical and

    then that changes the ionic properties of the thing and then so that you know
    the the general status of how many of the opsin in the rod or cone in question
    have absorbed their favorite wavelength of photon changes the electrochemical
    properties of this whole system and so the the the the the things that are connected
    to notice that okay this you know this particular Rod is ramped up it's it's absorbed
    a lot of its favorite kind of light and so that's kind of the part of the Cascade
    of neural activity that that sort of represents your um what's it called perceptual
    experience um yeah in your I I think this varies by animal but for us our rods
    are tend tend to be focused on green um green is a good color to be sensitive
    to on the planet Earth we have a lot of it sort of floating around um and the
    cones or color vision tends to be associated with it shows here as our red green
    and blue but it's generally um short medium and long wavelength of light where
    blue is short wavelength red is long wavelength and green is somewhere in the
    middle um and yeah they all kind of live there and they have a certain distribution
    and da da um the other thing to notice here is so this is the back of the eye
    the light is coming this way and so you might expect that the part of the rods
    in the cone that is the most sensitive to light would be facing the light but
    that is not the way to set up it is in fact the opposite um and so the the cones
    are facing away from the light and so light has to pass through all of these middle
    layers of cells so there's you know after the photo receptors you have what are
    called the middle layers then you have what are called the ganglion cells and
    they are doing all sorts of crazy stuff they're extremely complex I know there's
    some see all these textbook pictures make it look cleaner than it actually is
    um where we um but yeah so our our vision this looks a little better um so our
    visual system is backwards it's it's the opposite of how you would expect it to
    be in and how and there are Optical consequences of the fact that everything that
    we see is being imaged through like a couple layers of dense

    of the oceans and the the way that the light refracts because our eyes are very
    close very close in density to seawater um so whereas they're very different from
    Air so if you have a a visual system that first evolved in an environment that
    is roughly the same density as your eye um you're going to have to have different
    sort of refractive strategies where if you have an eye that is sort of basically
    hold a little bubble of SE water in itself and then it's refracting light that's
    traveling through a a you know an air medium um so things like seapods uh octopus
    squids cuttlefish their eyes are sort of the correct way around like they have
    very good vision and their photo receptors actually face outwards um which is
    sort of one of those things where it's like I don't have too much more to say
    about that other than like is that weird and interesting um okay how we it's also
    kind of funny because it's like because I have given this lecture many times before
    this is always this is also always roughly the time of the lecture where I realized
    that you need an entire lecture to talk just about the eye and then I'm really

    about about what's going on out here um even it is very interesting and and worthy
    of its own discussion um but if you want to know more uh you know just Google
    or asabot about like the the middle layers of the retina and then the gangan cells
    of the retina um I'll leave it at that I guess um but the most important part
    I would say of the entire eye my favorite part of the eye I suppose I my favorite
    part rather than the most important part I guess because probably the most important
    part is the cornea but that's not very exciting but my favorite part of the eye
    is this guy right here this little divot in the back of the retina that is called
    your fobia fobia is Latin for pit um and it is an area that when you are pointing

  text: here that is pointing at your retina so the act of pointing my eyes at something
    is basically lining up all this refractive Machinery with this little pit on the
    back of my eye and that pit is caused phobia yeah yeah there's an actual one yeah
    there we go yeah like this guy right here so basically this is a part of the eye
    where all the the extra stuff has been kind of pushed out of the way to leave
    an unobstructed Viewpoint onto this portion of your eyeball where this is the
    by by very very wide margin the highest density of photo receptors on your eye
    so if you look at your eye so there's many many ways that your eyes are not cameras
    um but one of the most important ways is that with a camera you have an equal
    yeah look at all there's all always fun pictures here yeah this is a good representation
    of how the focusing works it's like that's you're trying to make make constrain
    the world it's not showing the refraction at the cornea um see this person was
    too inspired by the lens shape of the lens to understand how that works um so
    the the bending should be happening here and then this should be kind of like
    extra um um but the uh let's see the uh distribution so with a with a camera your
    um like the sensor on the back of the camera is roughly equal density of photosensitive
    you know silicone pits um your eye has a much much different orientation um so
    if we're specifically looking at your cones there we go like this yeah so your
    cones of the red ones this is the one that we generally think of as like when
    we think of your when when you think of your vision in terms of like how good
    is my vision you're generally considering that in terms of the the behavior and
    performance of of

  text: your cones and the distributions of cones on the back of your retina looks
    like this sort of red Spike um so this is eccentricity so zero is on the phobia
    and then plus or minus however many degrees um and you can see that like the roughly
    50% of your photo receptors are in that ventral one Dee of your eye um and see
    photo receptor density trying to find like the the right visualization there um
    whatever uh oh yeah that's that's that's what I'm looking for yeah sure um so
    if you were to look into the back of your retina and sort of count up all of the
    photo receptors you you would find the vast vast vast majority of them like very
    densely packed in that fial central region of your eye so that when you are sort
    of pointing your eyes around um you're trying to optimize your eye movements to
    point this super high super densely packed region of photo receptors um at the
    object in question and that is also the area where they sort of that that core
    um that core sort of design fo of of the retina is sort of been sort of mitigated
    by sort of being by pushing all the the stuff out of the way um something else
    you might notice about this is the uh is the cones also so the the sorry the rods
    which are now these purple um that's your sort of that's your peripheral vision
    um and uh they are highly they like their distribution is sort of spread out to
    the periphery um which is thought to be for a lot of reasons like because the
    these things respond to smaller amounts of light they tend to respond faster so
    for things like peripheral cues mostly when when when we're thinking about a peripheral
    vision it's its job is not to give us precise sort of like I can read text levels
    of vision is to give us very fast information about stuff that's sort of coming
    in from the outside so that's kind of like the startle response and stuff like
    that

    a behavioral response and that's often driven by the the rods this is also why
    if you're ever out in like the dead of night looking at the stars if you want
    to see something in the very like when your eyes are very very dark adapted the
    best way to see something is not to look directly at it because in the in sort
    of the middle of the night your your rods aren't really working very well so if
    you look directly at something you're going to be getting less light than you
    want so astronomers learn that if you're interested in a particular star the best
    way to see it is to look a little bit off to the side of it and then let your
    your rods do the work of giving you the information of what's coming in um so
    next time you're out in a nice starry night you will you can try that out um yeah
    you know Seven Sisters of ple or plees are sort of like one of like that's something
    I've noticed this effect a lot on because it's like a very small um sort of cluster
    of stars where if I look if I'm looking directly at it I can't make out the individual
    stars but if I look a little bit off the side I start to be able to count that
    there's seven of them and for there a lot of the challenges looking not directly
    at the thing that you care the most about which is its own kind of like mental
    game that we can sort of probably not talking too much about um so so um and this
    is also where now that I've sort of talked about some of these like structural
    aspects of the eye and the retina um can't try to be like strategic about what
    I cover with the rest of this they got do a lot of this stuff um guess I'll also
    say this now focus on the thing Okay so we've been talking a lot about the eyes
    is kind of like in terms of its passive Optical properties um you know like the
    light bends here and is absorbed by this and the kind of like these photo receptors
    there that kind of thing um but you know a lot of what we wind up doing with our
    eyes is is shaped by that um and specifically in the context of like eye movements
    because we do move our eyes we move our eyes quite a lot um this is again one
    of those things that is it's not unique to humans but I mean every animal I'd
    say most animals actually not every animal but but most animal animal do move
    their eyes um and um but humans

    name of the family that we're in not H not family whatever group um we have our
    our our nervous system is very heavily geared around our vision and our vision
    is very heavily geared towards our ability to move our eyes very rapidly and very
    precisely in order to extract in order to point those super high Acuity regions
    of our phobia at the things that we care about with very high speed and very high
    um sort of spatial accuracy um your eye each of your eyes has six muscles on it
    uh so you have two muscle this is my eye and this is the front of my eye I have
    two muscles on the top and bottom whose job it is to move the eye up and down
    and two muscles on the side that move the eye left and right and then two weirdo
    muscles at the top and bottom whose job is to rotate your eye uh sort of like
    around its Optical axis that's called torsional eye movements and it's the kind
    of thing I'll be able to show this to you when I'm wearing an eye tracker but
    it happens all the time like your eyes if you do this your eyes are rotating in
    their Optical axis not a ton um these these muscles here pass through like like
    the one on the bottom comes in from from the bottom and the one on the top passes
    through this ligamentous sling so there's like a little like ligament that like
    loops around this Superior oblique muscle that attaches to the top of your eye
    and allows it to kind of rotate that way and so a lot of what we're going to like
    when I put the eye tracker on you see the kind of the eyeball bouncing around
    on the screen um the majority those eye movements are just stabilizing my head
    like stabilizing against like the motion of my head because if I'm like moving
    my head around which we we move our heads a lot um that the opson thing like the
    part where the opsin absorbs the light is a relative slow process like it's not
    slow to absorb it but it's slow to reset like there's a process there's a biochemical
    process in your eye after that opsin has absorbed in that Photon that basically
    has to go through and reset the opsin until it can absorb light again and that's
    mediated by like like vitamin A or something like that um and it takes time so
    you've seen this before like if you look at a light then you look away you can
    see an after image of that light in your vision and that's because those opsins
    have absorbed photons and then it's going to take time for them to reset and until

  text: they do you can no longer absorb light from that portion of your visual field
    because it's sort of been maxed out um and so because of that there's kind of
    like there's like you have to be able to stabilize your eyeball in sort of relative
    to the world in order for it to have time to form an image from the light that's
    sort of making it through this complicated sort of process uh to make ITA to your
    retina and so a lot of the the purpose of eye movements is just to act as like
    stabilization of your eye in the world and that happens sort of simultaneously
    to another process of information gathering eye movements where I can actually
    move my eyes to specific places because I care about the information that's from
    that portion of my visual field um and yeah and we'll we'll have much more to
    much more to say about that when we actually are looking at eyeballs in in closely
    um yeah it's very complicated uh and very very fast very fast very precise your
    eyeballs are the fastest and most precise motor structures on your body um when
    you're doing sort of like Fast interesting Behavior where that could be like walking
    across a rocky field or something like that or like playing sports or you know
    playing video gam something that requires like very fast and precise visual information
    you're making eye movements at the rate of about you know one every 150 milliseconds
    or so at the sort of fast that's the fastest they can go um and that is roughly
    like the minimum time that it takes for the the the image like the the the neural
    architecture to sort of extract information from that pipeline um and so most
    of the times they're not making eye movements nearly that fast but they can go
    up to that speed and this can happen while your body is sort of like you know
    you're jumping and running around through the through the world and like as you
    run your head is sort of bobbing around so this there's a very complex Machinery
    of stabiliz of gay stabilization um such that sort of information gathering sads
    where a sad is the name of a fast eye movement happen sort of on top of those
    stabilization mechanisms that are sort of allowing your eye to to be still long
    enough to absorb the information necessary to to form an image uh also so there's
    a lot of a lot of the field of vision Vision like visual neuroscience and stuff

    like for example when you were asking about like peripheral vision it's like oh
    that's happening at this other part of the um of the eye not the cornia uh there
    are similarly uh illusions that we can distribute to different parts of the visual
    system so one of them which you may have seen yeah this one always messes me up
    severely oops not that one no no no so this is called a Herman grid um which if
    you look at it you'll probably be seeing little ghosty black dots so when you
    look at a DOT it's white the dots are all white but the ones that you're not looking
    at are going to be a different color um realize similarly this is another one
    of those Classics where all the intersections are white I promise you they're
    all white but if you look at them you'll probably see little shadowy ghosty shapes
    in the corners of the other ones for a while some of the some one one generation
    of MacBook had this effect on the keyboard um but I think they probably fixed
    that um and yeah and this is basically caused by uh there we go this one messes

    15 16 17 18 um this one has the effect that you cannot come on I don't know if
    it works with the artifact there but like uh if you just Google Herman grid 12
    dots like this is one of the things like it's hard to display these things on
    a screen because they don't always work out but um you can't see all of them at
    once because of basically interactions with your gangan cells which have gangan
    Retina cells um this is a layer that I'm not I just don't have the there's a lot
    this is a layer that I just can't quite get to the the gangan cells have to do
    with like the pooling that happens um where it's kind of like it's this this layer
    where the the the the photo receptors from the different are kind of they get
    pulled together and sort of respond like you know they wind up becoming one um
    uh what's it called a nerve coming off the the back of your retina so like that's
    an area where in the central of your visual field like at that fobia region it's
    almost a onetoone mapping where almost every photo receptor has a an axon coming
    down and going back through your optic nerve um but around the periphery the the
    the signals from multiple receptors are they get pulled together and so a lot
    of these effects happen because of like the interactions from in that because
    if you're looking at the the the dot in question you see it correctly but then
    the periphery is doing pooling over that region of the retinal field so the whiteness
    of this dot gets sort of like mixed in with the darkness of the surrounding regions
    and so your your brain sort of interprets it as being a different color than it
    is and then when you move your eye towards it now it looks white but the thing
    you were looking at has this other effect and and let's see if this side is still
    running so fobia Shader toy and this is one of my favorite versions of that FIA
    detector so if it's working for me so every one of these crosses is rotating the
    entire time but if you're looking at it tell me if this is working from your perspective
    like only the part that you're looking at should have rotation and the rest of
    them look still is that working yeah

  text: that's because that's because of your phobia and because your phobia is so
    much more sensitive than the other if you just Google um phobia detector Shader
    toy you'll find this and it looks better on your screen um but it's one of these
    areas where like your your your ability to to identify the the motion is this
    is like this is designed to be kind of like at your your your threshold of your
    ability to do it and so the only portion of the screen where you can actually
    see um the motion is at that fobal place so the effect is a very strange like
    as you look around it will look like there's only like a little patch of it that's
    rotating and that that patch will follow wherever you choose to point your eyes
    um it's very yeah someday whoever is hting this site we'll stop hosting it and
    it be sad um oh but also that's funny the first time I found this is like I couldn't
    interpret the code but now I'm better at that so I'm like oh I can actually I
    know how to I can pull this into my own life and have more control over it um
    yeah else I wanted to show here yeah so the point is that your vision is complicated
    and it's complicated before it even hits your brain um there is a sort of interesting
    when I talked at some point about like periperal versus central nervous system
    I mentioned the retina or I I intended to mention the retina as kind of like a
    gray area there um because there is very easy to discuss like when you're talking
    about often times you talk about Central versus peripheral nervous system you're
    talking about in the context of like where which part of your eye which part is
    doing processing which part is just sort of like funneling the information either
    to or from the central nervous system and the retina is one of those cases where
    like it would really be hard to argue that what's happening in this sort of like
    middle layers of the retina wouldn't count as processing and a lot CU those the
    effects I just showed you those those Illusions I just showed you those are all
    at that sort of like those Illusions happen before the light and the neural activity
    driven by the Light ever leaves your eye um oh another visual effect oh just look
    up your blind spot too just just do me a favor and just pretend like I did that
    in class just look up just Google Blind Spot demo and then do the thing where
    like you learn how to like find the blind spot where your thumb disappears and
    then you know just have it have feelings about that um but yeah so the eye is
    a very complicated thing and the eyeball itself is there's a lot going on there
    um and we're going to talk a little I'll find I'll find time to talk more about

  text: the kind of the the primary visual cortex um layer of things which is typically
    where when we think about like visual processing we're thinking about something
    that's happening in the brain and sort of like and there is you know a good chunk
    of our brain is devoted to Vision um and in this sort of visual cortex area um
    roughly 50% of the visual cortex is devoted towards that Central one degree of
    your PO of your phobia your phobia by the way is about the size of your thumbnail
    at arms length so about 50% of your visual cor 50% of your photo receptors and
    50% of your visual cortex are devoted to processing this much of your visual field
    so about 1% of your visual field is about 50% about 50% of your architecture of
    your visual system is devoted to that 1% of your visual field and that kind of
    is to make the point that it's the ability to move the eyes as precisely as we
    do that gives them the ability to operate and to guide our motor Behavior as effectively
    as as it can and that is the end of the class uh next Wednesday I will come in
