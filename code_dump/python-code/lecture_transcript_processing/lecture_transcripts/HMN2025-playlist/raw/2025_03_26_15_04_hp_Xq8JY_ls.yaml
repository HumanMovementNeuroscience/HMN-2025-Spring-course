full_transcript: um but yeah so if you're interested we can follow that and um other
  than that we going to go ahead and get started so this is kind of like I wouldn't
  necessarily call it a ride of Passage it's more of a shtick than anything else um
  but it's something that I kind of recommend trying to sort of cultivate in yourself
  if you find interest and if you sort of especially if you're planning on having
  anything resembling a career or lifetime studying humans and Science and biology
  and that kind of thing and the idea is to kind of like have a sense in your own
  mind of like what the complete story is like where do you where do you think things
  come from right we kind of a big focus in this course is the sort of like empiricist
  game of like trying to think about how everything is sort of can be traced back
  to some kind of empirical measure and you know while hopefully pretty aggressively
  emphasizing the fact that those links are always kind of fuzzy and murky at best
  um the idea of like you know I think one of the cornerstones of scientific thinking
  is the idea that you're not allowed to believe things without some kind of a reason
  for believing it um in your daily life you absolutely are you can think all sorts
  of things and they don't have to be particularly grounded but in the the scientific
  sort of part of life as particular in the world of scientific communication and
  research the idea is that everything has to be grounded in some way so this particular
  slice of the you know the large scale cosmological story of human existence is my
  attempt to sort of like cohere everything that I know about those stories into something
  that resembles like a coherent narrative um we're going to be touching on topics
  which I am very far from an expert on um like expert enough to teach a class like
  this but one of the things that happens when you start becoming a professional researcher
  is you start to realize the difference between being familiar with a topic being
  an expert in a topic and being like a real expert in a topic and these are topics
  which I am sort of at best quite familiar with but good enough to get started so
  first things first big bang boom that's where as far as we understand and as far
  as we sort of currently believe we with a capital W meaning humans as a whole that's
  where we believe things started or at least that's the beginning of the story that
  we can tell Big Bang is our current cultural preferred creation myth um and like
  all good creation myths it explains a lot of the data it explains as much of the
  data as we can explain but also like all creation misss that have come before it
  really doesn't explain everything and it's not a fully coherent story like in ancient
  Japan there was a myth that Japan was formed by a God who stuck a sword into the
  water and pulled it out and the droplets form the islands that's a pretty good story
  to help you understand like where to find more islands like if you go west you're
  not going to find any if you or East I guess you're not going to find any if you
  go west you find a big land mask if you go down Southwest you're going to find a
  big string of Island so it's useful in that regard but it doesn't it's not particularly
  satisfying from a sort of geological perspective um similarly a lot of the western
  tradition is based off of the cosmology of the Bible um which we don't really tend
  to think about in the beyond the sort of let there be light aspect of it but if
  you go back and read um just like the first like 150 words of it there's a it there's
  a ref it's sort of it's based off like a more ancient kind of Hebrew cosmology that
  like we're kind of like living in a bubble in a giant ocean where there's like an
  infinite ocean and then the stars form like a like a dome and then we're like this
  like crust of Earth floating on an infinite Ocean and the fixed stars are the thing
  that's holding it up and that was kind of enough to explain why there are such a
  thing as fixed Stars which we know now are not fixed they're just really far away
  and there's these other things called planets that kind of zip around on the inside
  which we used to think were part of like these spheres and inside on each other
  again sort of a lot of stories that helped us to sort of make sense of the scientific
  data that we had but I'll bet if you were to sit down any of the sort of Scholars
  of the time and really sort of ask them like how certain are you that this is the
  full story I would hope at least that they would give you an answer at least somewhat
  similar to what you would get from a modern cosmologist uh who would say well it's
  almost certainly not true that story that we tell and we know that it's not true
  because everything we've thought before has also been proven to be not true uh and
  everything that we continue to learn causes us to continue to reshape that story
  um with things like the big bang it explains why if you look out you see expansion
  in all directions and if you sort of like roll the clock back of something that's
  always expanding in all directions you eventually get to a place where it's in a
  small compact space and then you know you can do all sorts of more specific complex
  global scale scientific efforts involving such things as radio telescopes on the
  earth and on the top of mountains and in low earth orbit um I guess not so low earth
  orbit anymore um and you can tell all sorts of stories that make sense but in the
  same way that The Sword and the water doesn't really EXP explain everything there
  is to know about Japan the Big Bang also doesn't explain everything there is to
  know about the Universe um there was just a some popsy article about some recent
  modeling discovery that you it the data might make more sense if we give up on the
  concept of the conservation of energy and that might sort of explain the data better
  which would seem like kind of a big tradeoff but we've actually given up that before
  when we started moving towards re relatively well that's not really true but anyways
  um point is if you want to tell a story that's grounded in Empirical research it's
  typically going to start with something like the big bang the Big Bang was a massive
  explosion where you know pops stor of the past couple of weeks notwithstanding um
  all of the energy in the universe was made available at that time so the story as
  far as we can as far as the story as far as I understand it is that in those sort
  of initial moments of expansion uh everything was there including a bunch of antimatter
  and a bunch of matter however you want to define those things I'm not really there
  um which when put into contact with each other obliterate themselves and are replaced
  with the equivalent eal mc^2 of energy and that sort of initial obliteration of
  matter and antimatter is thought to be the source of all you okay look like you're
  fighting for your life doing great um yeah so that sort of is the source of all
  the energy Mo most of that explosion turned into light and heat and things like
  that there was not such a thing yet as chemistry we'll get to that in a bit um but
  in some in one of the the first perhaps sort of oldest by date scientific Mysteries
  um whatever obliteration happened in those first Pico seconds of the universe was
  not symmetric there was after all the uh matter and antimatter obliterated itself
  there was some stuff left over which is very convenient for us cuz that's you know
  everything that we know and care about um and it's some of the oldest not oldest
  um because actually relatively frequent recent but um there's strange math of symmetry
  breaking physics which is trying to understand why there was something left over
  after that initial obliteration and stuff um Emily nuther is a is a name there who
  also has sort of the historical interest of being a female physicist from way back
  before that was cool and there's some strange stories of like scientists you've
  heard of like Einstein like cheating universities to sort of trick them into hiring
  her and she did a bunch of early math of symmetry baking physics anyway so after
  those first Pico seconds of expansion all the energy that we could ever care about
  as far as we know is created um and then for a period of time which I'm actually
  not familiar on the exact amount of time uh that's all that there was just a bunch
  of plasma and extremely hot gas um which was too hot to do anything that we would
  think of as a gas and as that expansion expanded outwards the universe cooled off
  as things tend to do and slowly but surely um the the initial stuff of the universe
  started to coales and the coalesence um I think the first thing that formed that
  we would recognize was this you know things like the quirks and the protons and
  the electrons and then the sort of our very first good friends named hydrogen um
  going to slowly but surely actually not that slowly we're going to sort of quickly
  what's the word periodic table if you want to talk about the history of biology
  you kind of do have to start with the big bang because the Big Bang is how you explain
  why you have such a weird thing as this this is also a nice uh approximation of
  true a very useful sort of configuration of letters which have a lot of meaning
  associated with them and as far as the story that we're telling we've just reached
  here um and the hydrogens form at some point in the history of the early Universe
  I should know that number maybe next year I will uh but slowly over time those gases
  cool down and you get such a strange thing as a nebula a nebula is just a big wad
  of gas floating through space um uh the nebula form because there's such a strange
  thing as gravity and gravity is something that pulls matter together and so if you
  have this sort of a bunch of random stuff floating through the universe and there's
  nothing else going on and these and they're slowly heat makes things zip apart from
  each other gravity makes things pull towards each other turns out that's a pretty
  important important distinction for the rest of the time that will come um and so
  as the universe starts to cool down the particles start to pull in on themselves
  they form big clouds called nebula and eventually you get enough of these gases
  together and I say gases but really there only one gas at this point it's hydrogen
  there might be I don't I don't even think there's helium yet I think it's just hydrogen
  um and there gets to be enough of it that the gas pulls in on itself even more the
  gravity sort of smush wants to smush everything down into the smallest pace place
  smallest space possible and until eventually uh the gas gets so squished down and
  as it gets squished it rubs on itself and gets hotter and not really friction but
  the compression of the of gravity uh causes another very important event in the
  history of our universe which is the ignition of the first stars now it is really
  an ignition and I am going to speat up here because it's important to get to the
  parts of this that actually have like neurons and stuff like that to make it relevant
  to the course but I promise it is at least a little bit relevant so basically nice
  so you get the big clouds and they slowly sort of condense down until you until
  they become spheroids and as the gravity is pushing in the gases are getting hotter
  until eventually some strange Quantum effect happens um it's not exactly like a
  combustion engine in your car um because there's like it's like a Quantum superp
  position thing I guess but eventually it gets squished together enough that you
  get a very strange effect called fusion and fusion is the thing that happens um
  skipping over some details because I'm not fully aware of them but Fusion is what
  happens when you get from something that looks like this which is one proton and
  one electron and you get them close enough together that some strange thing happens
  and they become something like that which is our good friend helium so once that
  once that process happens Fusion is a is an extremely exothermic reaction so the
  a massive amount of energy is released when these hydrogen form into this helium
  and so now the collapsing force of gravity is being pushed back against by the exploding
  force of fusion and you have a nice stable star which is happily burning hydrogen
  into helium good job for that star um now that last for a good little while and
  so basically right now this star of which I if I knew more about stars I would know
  the type um but I don't so let's not worry about it this star is now burning its
  Fuel and its fuel is hydrogen and the output of that fuel of that burning is helium
  and so that is all well and good until eventually the star runs out of gas and so
  now it no longer has more hydrogen and that's nothing but helium and this force
  of compression is not enough to fuse helium into lithium and berum and guess like
  that some of those details about the elements is going to squish out in a little
  bit but good enough for the conversation um and So eventually when all the helium
  is gone and the fusion force is no longer fighting against the force of gravity
  the star starts to collapse again and as it collapses it gets denser and it gets
  hotter until eventually you do have enough of the force enough juice to form to
  to start fusing helium into barils and lithiums you get you got one you got your
  ones you got your twos now you can start making threes and fours that's math that's
  chemistry that's cosmology there's probably other details involved I'm sure you
  guys are taking all of classes in that right now um so he so now we burn through
  our hydrogen we're starting to burn our helium but this proc and this process is
  also Fusion it is also extremely exothermic but it is less efficient than the previous
  one helium plus helium equals Brum produces less energy than hydrogen plus hydrogen
  equals uh helium but that's okay because we still got this thing we're now in a
  new phase of star life we're burning hydrogen we're making burum and that all lasts
  for a good good long time until eventually you start running out of helium and you
  get that same sort of process over again this is probably like overlapping it's
  probably not you do one then the other but eventually you start getting to a point
  where the star is trying to collapse again and then you start getting hot enough
  that you can start fusing your barils into the other kind of weird stuff that comes
  through now this good story works for a good long way where the best most efficient
  reaction you can have is hydrogen to helium but then as you start you know losing
  that steam you start getting hotter and hotter collapsing until you can start fusing
  the different elements into heavier elements and that process works pretty well
  all the way up to and I think including iron iron very useful thing and for daily
  life um is the first point in this kind of March of chemical complexity where the
  process of and I'm just really be making this up I'm not sure if it's a process
  that makes hydrogen or the or sort of processes of fusing hydrogen afterwards this
  process of explos of fusion is not sufficient to fight against the crushing force
  of gravity and so when that happens the star starts to collapse down down even further
  and as it's going um basically every time it burns through one of these elements
  the time that it takes to start burning the other one and run out gets smaller and
  smaller until by the time you do uh you get to to hydrogen sorry to to iron the
  collapsing doesn't even as you sort of it takes you longer to do it and also has
  like the diminishing returns like you get less Bang your buck I suppose literally
  um until event once you get past iron that explosion no longer stops the clock like
  it's no longer enough to keep the star coherent and so you get this process where
  the star starts to collapse in on itself sort of like chunk by chunk piece by piece
  and every time the outer core collapses it it hits the inner core creates another
  pressure spike and that pressure spike is where you get most of these other heavier
  elements down until you start getting into some kind of like these may only exist
  in Labs sort of things that towards the bottom um and then once all of that sort
  of depending on the size of the star and sort of the the the makeup of the star
  um this process of sort of burning through the different uh chemicals and then this
  final process of collapsing eventually results in an explosion which is what we
  tend to call a supernova um and that Supernova is when all of these weird extra
  fancy strange relatively rare chemicals get spewed out into the universe and everything
  that we sort of know and care about all the weird chemistry that does all the cool
  stuff is comes from this type of a process and so and the strange thing about this
  the part that I find really I mean aside from all of it um really kind of troublingly
  onping is that a lot of the things that you talk about when you talk about space
  we talking about you know on the orders of like you know millions of years and tens
  of millions of years and sort of that the process of burning down from hydrogen
  to helium this could take you know Millions tens of millions of years this process
  after um Iron of sort of slamming down and exploding outwards like two weeks like
  a star scale of an explosion like big enough to rip our entire solar system apart
  happening on the SC on the on the space of like you know between now and the end
  of the poster presentation um so that's a little troubling but very useful for uh
  biology because this is where all the good all the good stuff comes now there's
  a couple things to note here when we're talking about the chemistry stuff which
  is that in terms of like you and me like most of the stuff that we're made of and
  that we care about tends to live pretty pretty pretty low on that list so when hydrogens
  you got your that's your carbon nitrogen oxygen like these are really our our our
  best good friends and they're and the fact that they are above this line means that
  there's a ton of this stuff in the universe in particular a good friend oxygen and
  our good friend hydrogen um carbon to hanging out um are all over the place and
  because of the prevalence of hydrogen and oxygen everywhere that also means you
  get tons and tons and tons of water um there is lots and lots of water in the universe
  just floating around there's a lot of like Stellar processes whose output is just
  water ice being flung out into the universe we're reading about this one you know
  star that they were looking at and they thought that it was emitting trillions of
  times the water on the earth on the surface of the Earth every second for like millions
  of years um there is no shortage of water in the universe and all these other guys
  that hang out around it your carbons and your nitrogens and your flines similarly
  prevalent um so yeah so that's useful um another useful Guy where are you where
  are you silica silicon silicon this is where you get rocks you get you get rocks
  from all sorts of places but silicon silicates um Rocky or rocky stuff which is
  again very useful for humans um and so as this sort of strange chemistry is going
  on I believe that the the the time scale the universe like 12 billion years I think
  that's the number that we tend to say I don't really know what these numbers means
  that that's one of those numbers that changes from time to time so uh but you know
  on that scale um and most of the time of the universe was spent just doing this
  and sort of getting to the point where we're burning through all these things and
  you know the first you know the in terms of percentage wise most of the universe
  has been spent doing this stuff um where are we at yeah so in terms of our list
  of things we've gone from the Big Bang to nebula to stars then the Stars start exploding
  and that's where you get the weird chemistry and then the weird chemistry is where
  you start getting such things as planets that same sort of process of accretion
  where the nebula turns into Stars uh and then the Stars start to explode and spill
  their guts out uh leads to other types of dust and then that other types of dust
  can form into other types of spheroids um some of which we like to refer to as planets
  um the definition of a planet is a complicated thing um it's not that complicated
  actually I just don't want to talk about it um but we for our purposes can just
  think of it as any Rocky spheroid that or orbits a star um and of course all of
  our well maybe not these days but um certainly the most useful planet for humans
  is Earth and Earth showed up at some point in the past um and started as a a as
  a a a disc of dust around a small yellow star medium-sized yellow star named Soul
  it wasn't named that before we named it but we did we did name it and it's named
  Soul um and slowly over time over millions and billions of years that dust accreted
  down into a Rocky ball which was mostly at the at it at the at the start of its
  life very very very very hot um hot like sort of magma liquid magma on the surface
  of the Earth um bad time for complex chemistry actually great time for complex chemistry
  bad time for delicate chemistry which is what we are made of and so for the majority
  of the lifetime of the planet Earth it was uninhabitable lava town uh acid rain
  solar radiation a bad times for biology however as stated before by these now out
  of nowhere I think this one um there's lots and lots and lots of water in the universe
  and so of the millions of sort of trillions of quadrillions of tons of dust which
  ACC Creed into the planet Earth a good percentage of that was Water Ice and slowly
  over time that magma ball of dirt that we call Earth cooled down to the point that
  some of that water was able to stay on the surface of the O of of the planet and
  not um not evaporate off into space and so that was the start of the oceans oceans
  are a very very useful thing for evolution of life because the universe is a rough
  place uh it's mostly empty but the places that it's not empty are pretty rough um
  and so if you want to have a process that would allow you to develop complex delicate
  biochemical processes there has to be a way of that that those processes to be protected
  from the horrible Universe At Large and so in every example of the evolution of
  life that we have available to us which is roughly this many um that Evolution began
  at the bottom of a warm liquid water ocean um in particular for us well talk about
  the details in a second so yeah warm liquid water ocean very useful thing for the
  evolution of life in at least one example and if we think about it probably other
  ones as well and if you ask yourself where is the largest warm warm liquid water
  ocean in the solar system you might think Pacific Ocean but you would be wrong the
  answer is Europa uh Europa is a or Enceladus I'm not sure which one both of them
  are moons of Saturn um they are ice planets so if you look down them from the outside
  just a shield of ice um but they're geothermic active so their their core is warm
  so there is between the core of ice and the rocky planet in the middle there there's
  a warm liquid water ocean um that we've never seen but we have flown space ships
  through the geysers that erupt from the bottom of those planets and when we sniff
  the the dust that gets thrown up there it's got like methane in it so not saying
  there's life down there but I'm just saying uh I would like to go down and check
  anyway so now we're on a planet don't need any buril anymore as far as I know um
  I think we use burum to make the lenses of thermal cameras because the it like can
  bend the wavelengths of light that you need for that but I don't need it in my day-to-day
  life um so here we are now on the bottom of the ocean and we start to develop our
  all all of our great great grandparents which is weird goop that's where we all
  came from and and somewhere in the process of whatever is going on down there in
  the bottom of that primordial ocean you start to get strange linkages of common
  molecules uh your you know your carbons and your hydrogens and your oxygens and
  your and your whatnots and again this is a story that changes somewhat on the regular
  and I haven't checked in on it in a little while but my my understanding is that
  we believe that the origin of life started with something resembling RNA RNA being
  a self-replicating molecule so the self-replicating is important right because now
  if you because you only need to make you only need to come across one of these things
  to have an infinite number of these things because if the if the thing is able to
  create more of itself then then you're off to the races um if you if you if you're
  self-replicating you have the materials for replication and the opportunity to engage
  in that behavior um now we've started what we might call biological evolution so
  the RNA is out there doing its thing until eventually whatever chemical thing happens
  this is where it also if I was a different type of biology Professor I would know
  this in more detail that RNA somehow becomes DNA the DNA starts to have its own
  little environment and we have this is something resembling this is probably what
  we would sort of if we could go back through the timeline and say this is the first
  this is the origin of life on Earth it would probably be some weird little guy that
  looks like this and this little guy has something which is very very important which
  is an inside and an outside the inside of this thing is everything that he would
  call himself if he has a gender which he but he certainly does not um the outside
  is what it would call everything else so we have a distinction now between inside
  and outside this if it could speak English it would say am this and this all that
  is everybody else um so these guys are slithering around for a good while until
  eventually some other guy decides that you know what I might I might just go ahead
  and eat you and so they're going around eating little guys like that and then he's
  like actually maybe you know for some in some weird camor of of factors over the
  course of millions and billions of years one of these things eats another one of
  these things but the thing on the inside doesn't die and so instead of dying it
  sort of maintains it sort of in says okay well I'm out here and you're out there
  and I still don't really care about that and I have everything that I need to sort
  of survive my life and I'm going to excrete things that apparently you need and
  as long as we can deal with this then I am happy and you are happy and we have now
  created UK carots um UK carots are little little goopy things with organ we believe
  that the organel were like proc carots eating each other and then sort of like you
  know making up after that anyways this goes on for quite some time until eventually
  the all the little goopy guys decide to maybe we should band together and form such
  things that we might call multicellular life now the first multicellular life as
  far as I understand it we're like uh tube worms I think that's like sponges and
  tube worms because at the bottom of the ocean all the action apparently happens
  at geothermal Vents and that's the place where all the weird chemistry on the inside
  of the planet spews out into the warm liquid water ocean which is protected from
  the hor horrible radiation and sort of uh what they called meteorite of of the outer
  world and so all this weird chemistry is where we can get the sort of the weird
  precursors that we need to have that mRNA and whatever DNA and the little procars
  and UK carots and whatnot and eventually we form little spires and we just live
  our happy lives for quite some time as tube worms at the at some geothermal vent
  at the bottom of some ocean somewhere on the planet Earth um again we are kind of
  going to be this is if you ever if you if you check my work I'm sure you'll find
  some places where the story doesn't quite line up with what I'm saying but in the
  manner of cartoons I I I I have done my own due diligence that if you did look up
  the details and you got those extra layers of of specificity you would understand
  why this cartoon is the one I showed you and not some other cartoon and you would
  say oh well he was missing some of the details he must not have realized this new
  research or this subtle Factor but two BMS on geothermal vents under the water is
  our current best guess of what's going on now at some point in this process one
  of these guys has a terrible idea which is that I think it's time to leave the geothermal
  vent and move around the world and if I'm going to do that I'm probably going to
  need something resembling a nervous system so in the sort of esops fable kind of
  just so story version of of evolution of life one of these tube worms kind of popped
  off and just became sort of a regular worm there's a lot of stuff I'm skipping here
  um but this regular worm there's also different branches of the Tree of Life where
  things sort of went off in different directions and some of these guys became like
  corals and stuff like that but the ones that we personally care about that we have
  a personal affiliation for are the wriggly wriggly worms and the wrigly worms um
  had a very good invention a really great idea I think one of the best ideas in history
  of life which is if you're a tube you're pretty much just a mouth and so if you're
  just a mouth then that's really also that's it's it's a it's a single purpose entry
  exit point you have an inside you have an outside and that's about it worms came
  along and they said I have a great idea let's have that tube go all the way through
  and let's separate our our concerns we have inut we'll kind of call this a mouth
  then we're going to have some other guy that we let things out through we'll come
  up with a name for that later and this is now we have worm good old worm when you
  are in other classes they talk about sea elegans and things like that it's these
  kind of guys um they have neurons um we've had sort of enough specialization for
  wor for neurons at this point um and they have something that we would call a nervous
  system because the neurons are sort of connected to each other um but it does take
  yeah and that's yeah but it there's nothing here that we would call like a central
  nervous system like there's no we don't have spines yet we don't have limbs yet
  we just have something which is capable of sensing the world and then performing
  actions on the basis of that information the first arguably likely chemo sensation
  um that's the sense sens s sensation in detection of chemical gradients in the environment
  we would refer to that as smell or taste um so if you walk into a room and you smell
  something you're picking up on a chemical gradient that you that is sort of different
  enough from your regular environment that you're like oh there's a smell it's coming
  from over there I wonder what it is probably some weird biology cuz that's makes
  volatile organic compound um and so these little wling worms honestly that that
  sensation was happening at the single cell part of this story like they they wle
  towards chemical gradients because that's how they find food um this is also um
  and actually I think this was also a UK carot thing uh somewhere in this process
  you have the very first beginnings of the evolution of vision as some things planked
  in style things start develop light sensitive patches on themselves and those light
  sensitive patches coupled with some kind of a uh motor local motor system um which
  in the water doesn't have to be very much it could just be a buoyancy bladder um
  allows them to float upwards when the sun is out and then sink downwards when Night
  Comes so they can float towards the surface of the water when the sun is out so
  they can do photosynthesis whatever they're up to um and then they can sink down
  Into the Depths at night so they can avoid Actually I don't even think we had really
  Predators at that point but light sensitive patches on single cell your organisms
  that's the origin of the kind of the weird chemistry I've talked about before all
  the opsin and all those like the weird photochemicals in the back of your eye uh
  owe themselves to the weird chemistry that developed these guys back here yeah yes
  so so here we are now we have some pretty good stuff we've got cells we've got neurons
  we've got light sensitivity we've got some kind of a motor system we've got a world
  which is increasingly less less uh magma uh lava whichever one it's like whichever
  one's on the surface I can't remember um Lava versus Magna like the it's like ones
  on the surface ones below the surface lava's on the surface yeah so our world is
  becoming increasingly less lava increasingly more ocean um everything's pretty great
  this persists for probably you know we're still in kind of the B territory so we're
  in billions of years of just kind of like wiggling around is weird goop and worms
  and tubes and sponges and stuff like that and then at some point uh this is another
  one that I really wish I I I had written the number down here uh there's a strange
  event that happens um so we're evolving things like shells and stuff like that um
  just like structure for our bodies under the water um and then in the in the fossil
  record it's there's a very very clear moment where all of a sudden there's life
  everywhere and it gets and it gets real weird and that moment is called the Cambrian
  explosion so Cambria is like if you're looking through cuts of rock you know farther
  down you go the farther back in time you are and there's at some point in this you
  just start seeing fossils everywhere and you get this strange type of rock called
  fossiliferous Limestone when I was at UT UT University of Texas at Austin um Texas
  used to be the bottom of an ocean and they have buildings made out of this fossiliferous
  Limestone just like you know big buildings and walls that's just like nothing but
  thick thick um fossils of you know things like B Valves and shells and you know
  strange things like that um and it is thought that the reason for this big explosion
  of biodiversity bi biological density and bi biological diversity was the creation
  of what is if the invention if the separation of concerns of the tube is the best
  invention probably the worst invention is the creation of predation um because before
  this time I think there was like people were still going around eating each other
  like I think just that's kind of a thing that would happen um but at some point
  you start to see the the beginning of the Predator prey arms race where the Predators
  start to realize that you know I can actually if I just I don't have to spend all
  my time trying to like do photosynthesis and all that kind of stuff if I just learn
  how to eat the things that can generate their own energy and so I'm just going to
  start really specializing in all the this the tools that I need to eat other animals
  and the and other animals become prey and they say well I'm going to have to sort
  of develop defenses against those Predators so that I can go around making my own
  energy and then this kind of again in the just so story of the cartoon version of
  the history of the world that I'm telling you this sort of Predator prey Dynamic
  starts to really Drive The evolutionary process into over overdrive and it is thought
  that the sort of the explosion of biodiversity that happened in the Cambrian explosion
  coincides with the original development of that Predator prey dynamic um in the
  animal kingdom um somewhere around this time this progresses for a while I believe
  at this point we're still kind of thinking mostly in terms of like B valves and
  gastropods and maybe some sort of worm like objects uh some of those worm like objects
  be sort of Branch off at roughly this time and become the seapods eventually seapods
  are things like cuttlefish and octopus and stuff like that very very intelligent
  animals that are have a very very distantly related to us so they still have things
  like opsins and stuff like that in their retina um but they don't have a lot of
  the other stuff that we that every other animal that has anything we would call
  intelligence has um because we have this yeah yeah we on Earth we do have another
  animal that we can look at that has evolved intelligent life life and it does have
  we we do have the same lineage at some point we have to go real far back to find
  it so that's one of the reasons why I have just like this deep Abiding Love of seapod
  Neuroscience because they are the closest thing we are likely to get to studying
  an alien Intelligence on the planet Earth um this is also around the time somewhat
  after this time um I don't know exactly when this is where you start to get a bunch
  of like really weird animals in in the in the floating around in the water um there's
  like you can look them up there's a lot of weird ones they got like weird and tenna
  and there's just like one like it's got like a buzz saw for a mouth um and just
  like strange animals swim around most of which didn't survive uh to the modern day
  a notable exception being uh horseshoe craps like horseshoe crabs and tryes they've
  been um like they're from this point in time uh or sort of around that time and
  so in that time you start to get the creation of another useful thing for humans
  stuff like bones and muscles start to show up on the in the sort of the lineage
  um and the first one well not the first one that I care about but but a skeleton
  of note um are the Bony fishes so so those are these kind of guys bony fish um and
  actually before these guys you have the jawless fish um and the jawless fish I believe
  are the first vertebrates um jawless fish jalous fish our modern closest friend
  uh the there's a bunch of them but the but the the most I guess common currently
  extant jawless fish is a lam pre Lam pre look like this they're horrible but they
  are the earliest I believe they are the earliest um vertebrate or vertebrate Cordata
  animal yeah I think they just look like that I think leeches are invertebrates um
  but they they do have that same kind of like sucker fish look but I believe that
  that might be this this is getting below my depth of the details but if I had to
  guess I would guess that they probably came onto the scene around like similar times
  um but they but leeches are not um well leeches evolved to suck blood so they must
  they probably came later they're like they're Predator they're like a a pred a parasite
  so they probably came later after there was something to suck blood from but they
  do look very similar um and these guys have a ver a a spine a spinal cord traveling
  down them um I I don't know if they have bones or if they're cartilagenous like
  sharks um but they showed up and they're good they're good friends in some ways
  if you go to a neuroscience conference um like Society for Neuroscience something
  like that there will still be big um chunks of the poster sort of uh City that shows
  up there um studying jawless fish and lamp R because they are the oldest sort of
  phoenic the phylogenically most ancient available Cordata uh which is which is us
  um okay how we doing on time doing yeah I'm going to speed up um yes yes and then
  at some point after them you get these guys which are the bony fish bony fish have
  things like skulls and things like like they have the spinal cord they also have
  the spinal column and um they also have things like eyeballs and so this is around
  450 million years ago quite some time um so whether or not this is the first of
  these of this type of thing or just like the first one that really leave a bunch
  of fossils but this is also the or this is the these are the oldest eyeballs that
  we know about um that we would sort of call something similarish to our own um a
  lot of things like clams and muscles have ey stocks they have you know uh photosensitive
  chemicals and little sort of optical objects um but these guys have proper eyeballs
  and um in this paper which is one of my favorite papers ever uh they talk about
  Mike Land talks about um there's evidence get out of here this is a this is a book
  chapter not a paper um there's evidence that this that even at this level of evolution
  450 million years ago these guys probably had eye movement patterns that are similarish
  to our own they they appear to have eye muscles um and they appear to have the sort
  of the the the Machinery necessary to have something like the vestibular ocular
  reflex which is the thing that I've harped on quite a lot about where if you move
  your head your eyes counter rotate talked about how ancient it was talked about
  how old it was talked about how you can't you can't lose V without also being dead
  um it's this old at least this old and the reason again in the cartoon asops Fable
  version of the story for that is that is all the same reasons why I said we need
  stuff like that like options are slow it it takes a while for them to respond to
  light and so if they're going to be able to form an image they have to have a mechanism
  for stabilization um and so because these opsin are in the billions of years old
  that chemistry has been around for you know that's that's that's from like goop
  era um if once you get to the point where you have animals that are forming detailed
  images of the world you have to have that coupled with a mechanism for stabilizing
  that gaze relative to the world so this same kind of so this paper just sort of
  goes through uh and looks at a bunch of animals the argument of this paper is that
  all forms of vision any form any animal with good Vision exhibits this sad and fixate
  strategy with with some sort of gay stabilization resembling V and so this is this
  is a goldfish you have Gaye head and then this is the result these patterns may
  look familiar if you're looking at the squiggly lines I pulled up the other week
  um this one is a rabbit which is I guess not as exciting but uh evolutionarily this
  is uh who was this guy oh uh deos Deo Cel deos Crane and a pigeon talking about
  that kind of like the head Bob motion as a gay stabilization mechanism um this is
  a chameleon this is a rock crab now we're getting into that sort of evolutionary
  depth um this is a stock eyed fly and so all these guys are exhibiting that same
  kind of pattern of sad and fixate with some kind of gay stabilization mechanism
  now we kind of jumped ahead in terms of the evolution here evolutionary story there
  but um just pointing out that this is like we're s starting to get into stuff that
  we have now touched in this course in that uh in this topic area now okay now we're
  going to we're actually not going to accelerate R because like we're going to start
  we're going to jump ahead but in terms of like the time that has passed the time
  is really going to start to condense here um because all everything I've said before
  this this is probably I mean this is 450 million years ago that means everything
  before this is 11 and a half billion years and everything after that is half a billion
  years um so even as I jump forward by like hundreds of millions of years we're still
  we're still zooming in very very very narrowly on just the the barest crust of history
  that we are actually a part of um so at some point after these fish we start to
  get another good addition well I guess yeah so at some point they you know they
  crawl out onto the land then they start getting their little hands and we sort of
  hands and feet we to develop this um particular pattern of tetr tetropolis which
  is the sort of the general shape of head AR head Upper Limb lower limbs that sort
  of you know has become quite popular of late um and that's where you get the the
  the fish crawl out you know cuz at this point everybody's still living in the water
  um plants have made it onto the have made it onto land but no animals have so fish
  start crawling out of the water to lay their eggs because it's safe and then they
  sort of get more accustomed to it and you get these kind of transitional like lung
  fish style guys who sort of like hang out on the borders eventually some of them
  crawl farther out and you get the uh um sort of like reptilian types and then those
  turn into the bird types and then those turn into the mammal types um and then the
  mammals kind of and that's when we're going to sort of sort of focus that's that's
  the focus of our current conversation um and there is this very famous animation
  um Sean Cosmos Evolution GIF that so this this whole story that I've been talking
  about of sort of like the evolution that kind of this whole history thing is kind
  of a play on the Sean version of this which he calls the cosmic calendar um where
  he goes through okay imagine that the history of the universe is this 300 65 day
  calendar where were we at this different points of the calendar if I maybe in the
  future I'll like remember those dates and use that same same stick um but this is
  so this is from the the show Cosmos which was a just a great show that it's I think
  still worth watching can you PL pause play no are you going to do it oh you're not
  the actual thing ah and so this is the the sort of the short form story of evolution
  going to show the thing yeah so this is from how you get the lipid B layer you get
  the propa you get the UK carots multicellular guys you get the sort of the rock
  poets you get the uh these little geothermal Vents and they break off and become
  weird worms they become weird fish they start they get these limbs they get bones
  they start cing out on the they reptiles they become the SIDS with Dinosaurs um
  and then they become become these guys so these guys are the first um first mammals
  um and they were basically tree shrews they were the like they were little sort
  of you know they were hanging out the same era as the dinosaurs they were sort of
  like they were small kind of hiding in the bushes type of thing and then when the
  cataclysm that killed the dinosaurs occurred uh it became a bad time to be a a megap
  Who who requires tons and tons of food to survive it becomes a very good time to
  be a microf um particularly one that was uh endothermic so we can warm our own blood
  um really useful tool we're going to come back to these guys and so they become
  these PR shoes and so particularly kind of our particular lineage of mammals is
  related to the tree like the tree part so I guess the first ones are kind of more
  I think they're more like possum like was the original mammals but I could be wrong
  but we specifically emerged from the tree shoes that were sort of living in the
  trees and that's where you get you know they were arboreal creatures so they lived
  in trees which means that because they are or Boral they're walking around on branches
  and because they are walking around on branches their main appendages are grabby
  and so you start to develop at even at this era of evolution a very tight coupling
  between the perceptual system and the motor system because we're we're we're squirrels
  we're running around on branches we're we're grabbing and moving and things like
  that so again in the uh just so story of evolution it makes sense that we would
  currently have such a tight coupling between our perceptual and Upper Limb appendage
  system because we emerged our our local motor system required us to have a very
  sort of tight perceptual motor Loop um and then we get some more of this stuff which
  we're going to talk about in some detail and then at this point in the thing he
  says these are some of the things that molecules do given 12 billion years of evolution
  leave hydrogen alone for long enough it builds radio telescopes and develops existential
  anxiety so congratulations okay so we have made it we've made it to Earth we made
  it to us roughly speaking um we've gone through that early stuff the goop phase
  bones and spines evolution of predation tetropolis mammals the grabby grabby tree
  shrew era of life and then uh various types of monkeys um monkeys and I guess Apes
  um which I won't belabor too much of the point there but we do this but we get to
  so around let's see I think this is the one I want this is not the picture oh this
  one so this is the head of the game here so in terms of the lineage of of extent
  primates um and we to much the basically there's a bunch of them there's monkeys
  uh old world Monkeys new world monkeys it's a another little piece of colonialism
  for your scientific nomenclature old world monkeys are the ones that live in Africa
  New World monkeys are the ones that tend to live in South America so old world monkeys
  is things like baboons um New World monkeys is ones like cap capin or capin or whoever
  they are um and then the Apes uh split off from the old world monkey and our current
  cousins are the great apes of which there are uh it's us chimpanzees bonobos gorillas
  orangutans Gibbons um I think that's it um and I do need to say this because it's
  important to me to share um but the uh yeah there's a b there's a big like evolutionary
  question like sort of uh question about like which of the exent Apes are the most
  similar to us and we all think chimpanzees but there are also bonobos um and we
  are equally genetically related to both of those and it's part of this question
  of like human evolution of like where are we more horrifically violent in our nature
  or are we more like caring and Cooperative in our nature and the answer is that
  that's not a well formed question because humans are too complex to have that story
  but the comparison of us to other great apes is always kind of I don't know an interesting
  um comparison there because in general chimpanzees are quite violent they are not
  as violent as they're often well they're pretty violent and quite scary and they
  handle things in a very aggressive way uh if I had more time I would talk about
  Jane Goodall who was perhaps my favorite scientist to exist um but we're not going
  to get there um but I have to read this one quote from Co love joy that was talking
  about arpus ramidus so arpus ramidus is the oldest ancestor that we do not that
  we share with the other Apes um and it was a do we share yeah we do share it was
  a grounded ape so it lived on it lived lived on the ground and um yeah so instead
  of being an arboreal animal that was a ground the animal and had Rus anyways um
  I'm not going to find this I'm also probably going to wind up spilling over into
  next class for to get some of the details here because there's running out of time
  and there's more to say about the actual human part of this um but uh there's this
  great paper about arpus ramus that was discovered you know the bones of this guy
  was discovered relatively recently um and I got to find the PDF so I can recognize
  the thing and because it's sort of asking that question around like the evolution
  of bipedalism and the evolution of humanity and kind of like what was life like
  for these early creatures and sort of what does that say about us and one of the
  big questions that often comes up is like were we engaging in and there it is yeah
  so what was the driving course of our Evolution um and one of the big questions
  is maleo male antagonism um as a driving force of Evolution versus sort of larger
  scale cooperation um and so this is perhaps my favorite sentence in a paper uh it's
  not sentence but favorite little paragraph which I will read in its entirety a frequent
  explanation of the K9 reduction in bipedalism so K introduction it's these guys
  like the bite like the big sharp B teeth and bipedality is that handheld weapons
  replace the SEC which is like something about like like your bite force and how
  good you are you know biting uh handheld weapons replac the SEC but if maleo male
  agonism had been had been fundamental to early homonid Fitness what selective agency
  would have reduced its signature character how B it is additional human attributes
  Bell the probability of the weapons argument an absence of sperm competition in
  gorillas and orangutans is accompanied by a dramatically reduced testes size and
  the elimination of a free free scrotum their testes are more judiciously sequester
  in a post penal budge in contrast not only are human scrota more pendulous than
  even those of the chimpanzees but the bipedality makes them extraordinarily vulnerable
  during upright combat it seems illogical to attribute habitual uprightness to weapons
  that would demand even greater selection for testy sequestration than is present
  in other primates which basically is to say that the pendulous of human testes suggests
  that the evolution that our Evolution at this time was not based off our ability
  to kill each other with weapons but must have had some other characteristics which
  the paper and sort of a lot of other sources go on to say that it was our ability
  to sort of communicate with each other and cooperate and sort of work together on
  things that actually kind of drove the the spread of humanity and I just really
  love the pendulus Test's argument for human compassion uh present in this particular
  paper and there's all this gets complex um ulatory crypsis all this stuff there's
  a lot of anytime you get into this layer of biology where people are are starting
  to talk about like male female interactions particularly in human evolution real
  dicey real quick like it's it's basically I think kind of impossible to do this
  research as a human person and not let the biases of your current moment and social
  life uh like history shape your explanation I think that the people who do this
  well are the ones who sort of recognize that and kind of do their best around it
  but you'll see a lot of like people who really aren't qualified using arguments
  from evolutionary psychology to usually explain why it's okay for them to do whatever
  they want which is a classic uh and long running human tradition um so after arpus
  you get folks like Lucy Lucy is a a afarensis AF afarensis uh Australopithecus afarensis
  Lucy Lucy was a often times when you get to this level of um what are you doing
  uh Lucy a aenis this Lucy no that's not that's Lucy uh why can't I click things
  that's Lucy oh that's Lucy so Lucy was just a surprisingly intact skeleton which
  in this world this is surprisingly intact um was around 7 million years ago she
  was the first obligate biped so Lucy spent no time in trees she spent all her time
  walking around she probably could climb about well as you know about as well as
  you know you could if you spent a lot of time climbing um but this skeleton is made
  for walking bipedally um and then you get to the period of time that I like to call
  the cacophony of homos uh where there was a lot many many different homed species
  just all over the place turns out it's a pretty solid body plan um and this is us
  this is homo neander Talis hiber hius Homo erectus which homoerectus was the first
  like bipedal skeleton which is why they called it that and then they they kept finding
  older stuff so like the the name is no longer quite where it wanted to be uh Homo
  habilis is one of my personal favorites homo tool user we were using tools before
  this um but you know they kind of like they the names are given at the time that
  they find the skeleton so they find um strata in the rocks of like suggesting tool
  use around this time um and yeah yeah and then and then they all then they all left
  they all they're all they all died somehow it's a little bit that's like another
  one of the strange Mysteries is all the other all of our homo friends died uh and
  it was just it was just us um there's evidence genetic evidence that we we absor
  abbed the homo neander Talis um rather than killing them uh they were bigger than
  us um at a time when we were kind of going through an Ice Age so that's a time when
  big things that have to eat a lot die faster than small things that went around
  so um there was some evidence that we were we were hanging out together and we probably
  did kill each other a lot but we also had uh more productive relationships that
  led to us being more and them not being around yeah so like around time all those
  yeah relationships between probably yeah it's rough I mean because we're talking
  so from from here back to AF forensis this is like 78 million years so this is this
  is a long time and you know we're basically in this era like little bipedal like
  you know ape men running around with sharp rocks and we were probably just bashing
  apart whoever we found cuz that's that's how nature is you know so um we but we
  really don't know so in this era so we find stone tools from this era and they they
  also have a cool evolutionary story where the the quality of the stone tools progresses
  kind of linearly um from like oh here's a rock and a place that it really shouldn't
  be um at some point we kind of figured out that like some rocks are better for bashing
  than others at other and at some point later we found out that if you smash the
  rock apart some parts of it become sharp um and we would find these places where
  they would like they would they they seem to just go find they had like a chunk
  of rock that they liked and when they needed to cut something up they would just
  smash It On The Ground pick up the flakes that are sharp use it for what they needed
  to do and then just kind of keep smashing um but there wasn't a lot of plan to it
  and then over time you could see that they would sort of have more and more sophisticated
  tools coming out um until eventually you get to the point where they're like they're
  doing like complicated Flakes and sort of like breaking it off and having more like
  coherent stone tools and stone blades up to the point of like the kinds of like
  Stone tipped um Spears and arrows that you would associate with like early humans
  and then we kind of just got better and better at refining our stone tools until
  eventually they became things like this this is a very complex Stone tool that we
  used from smashed apart rocks that we found on the ground so kind sapiens yeah yeah
  there's this kind of story of like telling the story of evolution is a a cop yeah
  popular narrative like see all yeah MH yeah and I mean we we have a pretty big head
  um I guess I should pull this out before I lose time um so this is this is Skelly
  the skeleton and and what there not nearly enough time left Skelly seem better days
  but I don't think I don't know if that part closes um so we have a pretty big brain
  case um but Meander Halls had bigger um and main part and I'm not going to have
  time for this I'm going to have I'm going to have to shuffle around some some class
  stuff so I have more time to talk about Skelly because I dragged him all the way
  here from JP um so we'll talk about we'll talk about it in more details but I will
  leave you not entirely leave you but I will leave you with this um so if you look
  at most mammals have a ridge on the top of their skull so like if you pet a dog
  just you'll feel like there's a ridge there cats to some extent um course gorilla
  skull and most other animals have um this thing oh that's called the sagittal Crest
  the sagittal Crest is a muscle attachment point so the red on this skeleton Is tendon
  attachment because your muscle doesn't attach to Bone they're tendon attach to the
  Bone and you can see on the side of the skull oh buddy You' had better days haven't
  you um I bought this in like a thrift store I like saw it like through the window
  and I was like so these things cost like this this thing probably cost like $800
  new um I CAU this one I got for like $300 which I probably could have argued down
  but I always feel weird haggling in America so I just bought it with the price they
  said um the so this this muscle attachment here on the side of your skull like if
  you put your hand on the side of your head and like like squeeze your jaw like just
  squeeze your teeth together you'll feel the muscles moving in your jaw muscle there
  and we have a pretty wimpy uh we have a pretty wimpy um bite as far as animals go
  that was the whole SEC thing that love jooy was talking about like we kind of suck
  at biting for mammals especially for Apes um but if you kind of Imagine taking that
  that part of your muscle that wimpy skull and push it together until your fingers
  meet that's kind of what you get here so we so your jaw muscles come from the Jaw
  they go through your uh your cheekbone and then they attach on the side of your
  skull and so if you're an animal that relies on its bite you want that attachment
  point to be as you want those those muscles to be as big as they can be and you
  want those attachment points to be nice and strong um so we over the course of uary
  time kind of gave up on that strategy and so now if you kind of Imagine one of these
  yeah these are all gorillas um if you imagine kind of like taking this and sort
  of blowing it up like a balloon you basically get what's left here so instead of
  having the really hard strong attachment points through on that top of the head
  you now get these kind of like wimpy diffuse attachment points spread out over the
  side of the skull um but you get much much more room to to stuff a lot of brains
  in and so this is kind of part of that so this is part of the thing that that love
  joy was kind of talking about was trying to make sense of us giving up our greatest
  weapon of of of strong bites and then this argument that oh we must have done that
  because we already had weapons um but then the other argument around pendulous comes
  in um and that's about where that story uh ends not not really ends goes a lot of
  places but that's where I'm going to stop talking about it um so I'm running out
  of time and I have more that I want to say about um the pelvis and the feet and
  the knees and all that kind of stuff because in my previous life I was a Locomotion
  focused scientist um but well I'll leave it here in the sense of um talking about
  the the tool use thing and The evolutionary record and kind of this this origin
  of humanity um that sort of comes about and again that kind of story around where
  we like what what was it like to be a human back in the early early stages of humanity
  um and so one of the things that they found was and so like I and I think that one
  of the things that that really kind of for me gives me the best view of what was
  going on back then was from the stuff that we could find from the fossil record
  which mostly refers to the tools um which were mostly rocks and things like this
  and you getting getting from simpler stuff like this to more complex stuff like
  this um but you also find the bones themselves which are sometimes just kind of
  you know the problem with fossils is that they don't happen very often they have
  to have a very specific set of circumstances for a fossil to occur and so the bones
  that we find are sort of like random and like you know things like Lucy are you
  know very indicative of a like that's that was a very big find um and so and there's
  two kind of and so some but sometimes we find things like burial sites and you find
  burial sites for animals for other homos that were not us things like homon naldi
  um was a relatively recent discovery and there was a relatively recent like within
  the past I say couple of years discovery of a of a burial site that they would find
  that they would they would bring their dead to this place and it was deep in this
  cave so they were they were like these guys which were basically like little you
  know like tiny little monkey men or monkey folk I suppose um were were taking their
  dead down into this cave and putting them in a particular chamber for some reason
  you know what would they they they probably didn't speak English but they had some
  reasoning for it and they would take they would go back to it and we would find
  animals in particularly um once you start talking about Homo sapiens which modern
  the the modern sapen sort of shows up around 200,000 years ago so anything from
  now to 200,000 years ago you pick one of them you put them here raise him in a good
  school identical to us genetically the same um so we find bones of old Homo sapiens
  and old uh home on theer Talis and sometimes we find them in burial sites but we
  also would find them they were always busted up like they hurt themselves a lot
  and one of the one of the primary human superpowers apparently relative to other
  animals on the Earth is our healing Factor like we heal very very effectively and
  very very fast relative to most other mammals um and this is this is of note because
  if we've ever known anyone who has broken a bone healing really fast from a broken
  bone is still kind of slow like it still takes weeks and months before you are up
  to speed again and we would find old forms old skeletons here covered in broken
  bones like they broke their bones all the time they live very rough lives and if
  they had broken bones and if they were still surviving to adulthood that means that
  somebody was taking care of them when they were injured they weren't thrown out
  because they weren't useful they were cared for and uh nursed back to health and
  there are some I don't I wish I had more details on this but there are some cases
  where they would find skeletons of of old homos um um that were that were um like
  twisted like like the like the limbs were twisted and not straight um as if they
  were they were born with a bone disorder and but the animal the creature that had
  that bone disorder still survived to adulthood which means that somebody was taking
  care of them and they took care of them for a years they this what whoever they
  were they were not pulling their weight in terms of like huning and Gathering so
  if were if they were able to survive to adulthood it's because someone else in their
  clade found more value in them than what they could bring to the table in terms
  of their raw physical capacity we would also find things like sometimes you would
  find these kinds of rocks um and they would be made out of things like like rose
  quartz just like uh rocks that are not necessarily good for tools but they were
  just like pretty and we apparently liked we still we like pretty Rock rocks and
  they would find these rocks but they wouldn't find them out and about they would
  find them in burial sites so someone had a hominid friend who died who had their
  favorite Rose quart and rather than taking this rare special rock with them they
  put it in the ground with their dead friend and I think that that is something in
  this last 30 seconds of class it's something I I go back to think about things like
  that a lot and I think about those sort of those Origins and that kind of story
  and what that says about like whether or not we have any hope in the present moment
  because there's a lot of stories that people like to tell around how harsh and horrible
  and rough it is in the world and how Only the Strong Survive and empathy as weakness
  and things like that but it's really not like if you go deep down into the bones
  of the fossil record empathy is the original superpower that allowed us to sort
  of take down mastadons and survive extinction of and sort of make it to the place
  that we are today so I think I am I guess legally obligated to leave it at that
  um I will bring this guy back out at some point in the future so I can talk about
  uh what Co love joy called the most phenetically distinct osteological structure
  in the animal kingdom otherwise known as the pelvis um not the skull the pelvis
  um but I other than that I will leave it at that and I hope yeah I hope there I
  was able to scrape that back to something resembling uh relevance to the current
  topic um and I hope I don't I hope that's not the only time you look into that story
  because everything I just said is just little tidbits that you really should pull
  those threats talk to the bot Google around about it whatever thing I said that
  you're like oh that's interesting dig in CU there's there's a lot more there and
  I guess this class is supposed to be about uh how to become like a real scientist
  type person and to do that it means joining that conversation and joining it in
  the context of the full story so we'll leave that there and

  text: um but yeah so if you're interested we can follow that and um other than that
    we going to go ahead and get started so this is kind of like I wouldn't necessarily
    call it a ride of Passage it's more of a shtick than anything else um but it's
    something that I kind of recommend trying to sort of cultivate in yourself if
    you find interest and if you sort of especially if you're planning on having anything
    resembling a career or lifetime studying humans and Science and biology and that
    kind of thing and the idea is to kind of like have a sense in your own mind of
    like what the complete story is like where do you where do you think things come
    from right we kind of a big focus in this course is the sort of like empiricist
    game of like trying to think about how everything is sort of can be traced back
    to some kind of empirical measure and you know while hopefully pretty aggressively
    emphasizing the fact that those links are always kind of fuzzy and murky at best
    um the idea of like you know I think one of the cornerstones of scientific thinking
    is the idea that you're not allowed to believe things without some kind of a reason
    for believing it um in your daily life you absolutely are you can think all sorts
    of things and they don't have to be particularly grounded but in the the scientific
    sort of part of life as particular in the world of scientific communication and
    research the idea is that everything has to be grounded in some way so this particular
    slice of the you know the large scale cosmological story of human existence is
    my attempt to sort of like cohere everything that I know about those stories into
    something that resembles like a coherent narrative um we're going to be touching
    on topics which I am very far from an expert on um like expert enough to teach
    a class like this but one of the things that happens when you start becoming a
    professional researcher is you start to realize the difference between being familiar
    with a topic being an expert in a topic and being like a real expert in a topic
    and these are topics which I am sort of at best quite familiar with but good enough
    to get started so first things first big bang boom that's where as far as we understand
    and as far as we sort of currently believe we with a capital W meaning humans
    as a whole that's where we believe things started or at least that's the beginning
    of the story that we can tell Big Bang is our current cultural preferred creation
    myth um and like all good creation myths it explains a lot of the data it explains
    as much of

  text: the data as we can explain but also like all creation misss that have come
    before it really doesn't explain everything and it's not a fully coherent story
    like in ancient Japan there was a myth that Japan was formed by a God who stuck
    a sword into the water and pulled it out and the droplets form the islands that's
    a pretty good story to help you understand like where to find more islands like
    if you go west you're not going to find any if you or East I guess you're not
    going to find any if you go west you find a big land mask if you go down Southwest
    you're going to find a big string of Island so it's useful in that regard but
    it doesn't it's not particularly satisfying from a sort of geological perspective
    um similarly a lot of the western tradition is based off of the cosmology of the
    Bible um which we don't really tend to think about in the beyond the sort of let
    there be light aspect of it but if you go back and read um just like the first
    like 150 words of it there's a it there's a ref it's sort of it's based off like
    a more ancient kind of Hebrew cosmology that like we're kind of like living in
    a bubble in a giant ocean where there's like an infinite ocean and then the stars
    form like a like a dome and then we're like this like crust of Earth floating
    on an infinite Ocean and the fixed stars are the thing that's holding it up and
    that was kind of enough to explain why there are such a thing as fixed Stars which
    we know now are not fixed they're just really far away and there's these other
    things called planets that kind of zip around on the inside which we used to think
    were part of like these spheres and inside on each other again sort of a lot of
    stories that helped us to sort of make sense of the scientific data that we had
    but I'll bet if you were to sit down any of the sort of Scholars of the time and
    really sort of ask them like how certain are you that this is the full story I
    would hope at least that they would give you an answer at least somewhat similar
    to what you would get from a modern cosmologist uh who would say well it's almost
    certainly not true that story that we tell and we know that it's not true because
    everything we've thought before has also been proven to be not true uh and everything
    that we continue to learn causes us to continue to reshape that story um with
    things like the big bang it explains why if you look out you see expansion in
    all directions and if you sort of like roll the clock back of something that's
    always expanding in all directions you eventually get to a place where it's in
    a small compact space and then you know you can do all sorts of more specific
    complex global scale scientific efforts involving such things as radio telescopes
    on the earth and on the top of mountains and in low earth orbit um I guess not
    so low earth orbit anymore um and you can tell all sorts of stories that make
    sense but in the same way that The Sword and the water doesn't really EXP explain
    everything there is

  text: to know about Japan the Big Bang also doesn't explain everything there is
    to know about the Universe um there was just a some popsy article about some recent
    modeling discovery that you it the data might make more sense if we give up on
    the concept of the conservation of energy and that might sort of explain the data
    better which would seem like kind of a big tradeoff but we've actually given up
    that before when we started moving towards re relatively well that's not really
    true but anyways um point is if you want to tell a story that's grounded in Empirical
    research it's typically going to start with something like the big bang the Big
    Bang was a massive explosion where you know pops stor of the past couple of weeks
    notwithstanding um all of the energy in the universe was made available at that
    time so the story as far as we can as far as the story as far as I understand
    it is that in those sort of initial moments of expansion uh everything was there
    including a bunch of antimatter and a bunch of matter however you want to define
    those things I'm not really there um which when put into contact with each other
    obliterate themselves and are replaced with the equivalent eal mc^2 of energy
    and that sort of initial obliteration of matter and antimatter is thought to be
    the source of all you okay look like you're fighting for your life doing great
    um yeah so that sort of is the source of all the energy Mo most of that explosion
    turned into light and heat and things like that there was not such a thing yet
    as chemistry we'll get to that in a bit um but in some in one of the the first
    perhaps sort of oldest by date scientific Mysteries um whatever obliteration happened
    in those first Pico seconds of the universe was not symmetric there was after
    all the uh matter and antimatter obliterated itself there was some stuff left
    over which is very convenient for us cuz that's you know everything that we know
    and care about um and it's some of the oldest not oldest um because actually relatively
    frequent recent but um there's strange math of symmetry breaking physics which
    is trying to understand why there was something left over after that initial obliteration
    and stuff um Emily nuther is a is a name there who also has sort of the historical
    interest of being a female physicist from way back before that was cool and there's
    some strange stories of like scientists you've heard of like Einstein like cheating
    universities to sort of trick them into hiring her and

  text: she did a bunch of early math of symmetry baking physics anyway so after those
    first Pico seconds of expansion all the energy that we could ever care about as
    far as we know is created um and then for a period of time which I'm actually
    not familiar on the exact amount of time uh that's all that there was just a bunch
    of plasma and extremely hot gas um which was too hot to do anything that we would
    think of as a gas and as that expansion expanded outwards the universe cooled
    off as things tend to do and slowly but surely um the the initial stuff of the
    universe started to coales and the coalesence um I think the first thing that
    formed that we would recognize was this you know things like the quirks and the
    protons and the electrons and then the sort of our very first good friends named
    hydrogen um going to slowly but surely actually not that slowly we're going to
    sort of quickly what's the word periodic table if you want to talk about the history
    of biology you kind of do have to start with the big bang because the Big Bang
    is how you explain why you have such a weird thing as this this is also a nice
    uh approximation of true a very useful sort of configuration of letters which
    have a lot of meaning associated with them and as far as the story that we're
    telling we've just reached here um and the hydrogens form at some point in the
    history of the early Universe I should know that number maybe next year I will
    uh but slowly over time those gases cool down and you get such a strange thing
    as a nebula a nebula is just a big wad of gas floating through space um uh the
    nebula form because there's such a strange thing as gravity and gravity is something
    that pulls matter together and so if you have this sort of a bunch of random stuff
    floating through the universe and there's nothing else going on and these and
    they're slowly heat makes things zip apart from each other gravity makes things
    pull towards each other turns out that's a pretty important important distinction
    for the rest of the time that will come um and so as the universe starts to cool
    down the particles start to pull in on themselves they form big clouds called
    nebula and eventually you get enough of these gases together and I say gases but
    really there only one gas at this point it's hydrogen there might be I don't I
    don't even think there's helium yet I think it's just hydrogen um and there gets
    to be enough of it that the gas pulls in on itself even more the gravity sort
    of smush wants to smush everything down into the smallest pace place smallest
    space possible and until eventually uh the gas gets so

  text: squished down and as it gets squished it rubs on itself and gets hotter and
    not really friction but the compression of the of gravity uh causes another very
    important event in the history of our universe which is the ignition of the first
    stars now it is really an ignition and I am going to speat up here because it's
    important to get to the parts of this that actually have like neurons and stuff
    like that to make it relevant to the course but I promise it is at least a little
    bit relevant so basically nice so you get the big clouds and they slowly sort
    of condense down until you until they become spheroids and as the gravity is pushing
    in the gases are getting hotter until eventually some strange Quantum effect happens
    um it's not exactly like a combustion engine in your car um because there's like
    it's like a Quantum superp position thing I guess but eventually it gets squished
    together enough that you get a very strange effect called fusion and fusion is
    the thing that happens um skipping over some details because I'm not fully aware
    of them but Fusion is what happens when you get from something that looks like
    this which is one proton and one electron and you get them close enough together
    that some strange thing happens and they become something like that which is our
    good friend helium so once that once that process happens Fusion is a is an extremely
    exothermic reaction so the a massive amount of energy is released when these hydrogen
    form into this helium and so now the collapsing force of gravity is being pushed
    back against by the exploding force of fusion and you have a nice stable star
    which is happily burning hydrogen into helium good job for that star um now that
    last for a good little while and so basically right now this star of which I if
    I knew more about stars I would know the type um but I don't so let's not worry
    about it this star is now burning its Fuel and its fuel is hydrogen and the output
    of that fuel of that burning is helium and so that is all well and good until
    eventually the star runs out of gas and so now it no longer has more hydrogen
    and that's nothing but helium and this force of compression is not

  text: enough to fuse helium into lithium and berum and guess like that some of those
    details about the elements is going to squish out in a little bit but good enough
    for the conversation um and So eventually when all the helium is gone and the
    fusion force is no longer fighting against the force of gravity the star starts
    to collapse again and as it collapses it gets denser and it gets hotter until
    eventually you do have enough of the force enough juice to form to to start fusing
    helium into barils and lithiums you get you got one you got your ones you got
    your twos now you can start making threes and fours that's math that's chemistry
    that's cosmology there's probably other details involved I'm sure you guys are
    taking all of classes in that right now um so he so now we burn through our hydrogen
    we're starting to burn our helium but this proc and this process is also Fusion
    it is also extremely exothermic but it is less efficient than the previous one
    helium plus helium equals Brum produces less energy than hydrogen plus hydrogen
    equals uh helium but that's okay because we still got this thing we're now in
    a new phase of star life we're burning hydrogen we're making burum and that all
    lasts for a good good long time until eventually you start running out of helium
    and you get that same sort of process over again this is probably like overlapping
    it's probably not you do one then the other but eventually you start getting to
    a point where the star is trying to collapse again and then you start getting
    hot enough that you can start fusing your barils into the other kind of weird
    stuff that comes through now this good story works for a good long way where the
    best most efficient reaction you can have is hydrogen to helium but then as you
    start you know losing that steam you start getting hotter and hotter collapsing
    until you can start fusing the different elements into heavier elements and that
    process works pretty well all the way up to and I think including iron iron very
    useful thing and for daily life um is the first point in this kind of March of
    chemical complexity where the process of and I'm just really be making this up
    I'm not sure if it's a process that makes hydrogen or the or sort of processes
    of fusing hydrogen afterwards this process of explos of fusion is not sufficient
    to fight against the crushing force of gravity and so when that happens the star
    starts to collapse down down even further and

  text: as it's going um basically every time it burns through one of these elements
    the time that it takes to start burning the other one and run out gets smaller
    and smaller until by the time you do uh you get to to hydrogen sorry to to iron
    the collapsing doesn't even as you sort of it takes you longer to do it and also
    has like the diminishing returns like you get less Bang your buck I suppose literally
    um until event once you get past iron that explosion no longer stops the clock
    like it's no longer enough to keep the star coherent and so you get this process
    where the star starts to collapse in on itself sort of like chunk by chunk piece
    by piece and every time the outer core collapses it it hits the inner core creates
    another pressure spike and that pressure spike is where you get most of these
    other heavier elements down until you start getting into some kind of like these
    may only exist in Labs sort of things that towards the bottom um and then once
    all of that sort of depending on the size of the star and sort of the the the
    makeup of the star um this process of sort of burning through the different uh
    chemicals and then this final process of collapsing eventually results in an explosion
    which is what we tend to call a supernova um and that Supernova is when all of
    these weird extra fancy strange relatively rare chemicals get spewed out into
    the universe and everything that we sort of know and care about all the weird
    chemistry that does all the cool stuff is comes from this type of a process and
    so and the strange thing about this the part that I find really I mean aside from
    all of it um really kind of troublingly onping is that a lot of the things that
    you talk about when you talk about space we talking about you know on the orders
    of like you know millions of years and tens of millions of years and sort of that
    the process of burning down from hydrogen to helium this could take you know Millions
    tens of millions of years this process after um Iron of sort of slamming down
    and exploding outwards like two weeks like a star scale of an explosion like big
    enough to rip our entire solar system apart happening on the SC on the on the
    space of like you know between now and the end of the poster presentation um so
    that's a little troubling but very useful for uh biology because this is where
    all the good all the good stuff comes now there's a couple things to note here
    when we're talking about the chemistry stuff which is that in terms of like you
    and me like most of the stuff that we're made of and that we care about tends

    nitrogen oxygen like these are really our our our best good friends and they're
    and the fact that they are above this line means that there's a ton of this stuff
    in the universe in particular a good friend oxygen and our good friend hydrogen
    um carbon to hanging out um are all over the place and because of the prevalence
    of hydrogen and oxygen everywhere that also means you get tons and tons and tons
    of water um there is lots and lots of water in the universe just floating around
    there's a lot of like Stellar processes whose output is just water ice being flung
    out into the universe we're reading about this one you know star that they were
    looking at and they thought that it was emitting trillions of times the water
    on the earth on the surface of the Earth every second for like millions of years
    um there is no shortage of water in the universe and all these other guys that
    hang out around it your carbons and your nitrogens and your flines similarly prevalent
    um so yeah so that's useful um another useful Guy where are you where are you
    silica silicon silicon this is where you get rocks you get you get rocks from
    all sorts of places but silicon silicates um Rocky or rocky stuff which is again
    very useful for humans um and so as this sort of strange chemistry is going on
    I believe that the the the time scale the universe like 12 billion years I think
    that's the number that we tend to say I don't really know what these numbers means
    that that's one of those numbers that changes from time to time so uh but you
    know on that scale um and most of the time of the universe was spent just doing
    this and sort of getting to the point where we're burning through all these things
    and you know the first you know the in terms of percentage wise most of the universe
    has been spent doing this stuff um where are we at yeah so in terms of our list
    of things we've gone from the Big Bang to nebula to stars then the Stars start
    exploding and that's where you get the weird chemistry and then the weird chemistry
    is where you start getting such things as planets that same sort of process of
    accretion where the nebula turns into Stars uh and then the Stars start to explode
    and spill their guts out uh leads to other types of dust and then that other types
    of dust can form

    um the definition of a planet is a complicated thing um it's not that complicated
    actually I just don't want to talk about it um but we for our purposes can just
    think of it as any Rocky spheroid that or orbits a star um and of course all of
    our well maybe not these days but um certainly the most useful planet for humans
    is Earth and Earth showed up at some point in the past um and started as a a as
    a a a disc of dust around a small yellow star medium-sized yellow star named Soul
    it wasn't named that before we named it but we did we did name it and it's named
    Soul um and slowly over time over millions and billions of years that dust accreted
    down into a Rocky ball which was mostly at the at it at the at the start of its
    life very very very very hot um hot like sort of magma liquid magma on the surface
    of the Earth um bad time for complex chemistry actually great time for complex
    chemistry bad time for delicate chemistry which is what we are made of and so
    for the majority of the lifetime of the planet Earth it was uninhabitable lava
    town uh acid rain solar radiation a bad times for biology however as stated before
    by these now out of nowhere I think this one um there's lots and lots and lots
    of water in the universe and so of the millions of sort of trillions of quadrillions
    of tons of dust which ACC Creed into the planet Earth a good percentage of that
    was Water Ice and slowly over time that magma ball of dirt that we call Earth
    cooled down to the point that some of that water was able to stay on the surface
    of the O of of the planet and not um not evaporate off into space and so that
    was the start of the oceans oceans are a very very useful thing for evolution
    of life because the universe is a rough place uh it's mostly empty but the places
    that it's not empty are pretty rough um and so if you want to have a process that
    would allow you to develop complex delicate biochemical processes there has to
    be a way of that that those processes to be protected from the horrible Universe

    in a second so yeah warm liquid water ocean very useful thing for the evolution
    of life in at least one example and if we think about it probably other ones as
    well and if you ask yourself where is the largest warm warm liquid water ocean
    in the solar system you might think Pacific Ocean but you would be wrong the answer
    is Europa uh Europa is a or Enceladus I'm not sure which one both of them are
    moons of Saturn um they are ice planets so if you look down them from the outside
    just a shield of ice um but they're geothermic active so their their core is warm
    so there is between the core of ice and the rocky planet in the middle there there's
    a warm liquid water ocean um that we've never seen but we have flown space ships
    through the geysers that erupt from the bottom of those planets and when we sniff
    the the dust that gets thrown up there it's got like methane in it so not saying
    there's life down there but I'm just saying uh I would like to go down and check
    anyway so now we're on a planet don't need any buril anymore as far as I know
    um I think we use burum to make the lenses of thermal cameras because the it like
    can bend the wavelengths of light that you need for that but I don't need it in
    my day-to-day life um so here we are now on the bottom of the ocean and we start
    to develop our all all of our great great grandparents which is weird goop that's
    where we all came from and and somewhere in the process of whatever is going on
    down there in the bottom of that primordial ocean you start to get strange linkages
    of common molecules uh your you know your carbons and your hydrogens and your
    oxygens and your and your whatnots and again this is a story that changes somewhat
    on the regular and I haven't checked in on it in a little while but my my understanding
    is that we believe that the origin of life started with something resembling RNA
    RNA being a self-replicating molecule so the self-replicating is important right
    because now if you because you only need to make you only need to come across
    one of these things to have an infinite number of these things because if the
    if the thing is able to create more of itself then then you're off to the races
    um if you if you if you're self-replicating you have the materials for replication
    and the opportunity to engage in that behavior um now we've started what we might

    whatever chemical thing happens this is where it also if I was a different type
    of biology Professor I would know this in more detail that RNA somehow becomes
    DNA the DNA starts to have its own little environment and we have this is something
    resembling this is probably what we would sort of if we could go back through
    the timeline and say this is the first this is the origin of life on Earth it
    would probably be some weird little guy that looks like this and this little guy
    has something which is very very important which is an inside and an outside the
    inside of this thing is everything that he would call himself if he has a gender
    which he but he certainly does not um the outside is what it would call everything
    else so we have a distinction now between inside and outside this if it could
    speak English it would say am this and this all that is everybody else um so these
    guys are slithering around for a good while until eventually some other guy decides
    that you know what I might I might just go ahead and eat you and so they're going
    around eating little guys like that and then he's like actually maybe you know
    for some in some weird camor of of factors over the course of millions and billions
    of years one of these things eats another one of these things but the thing on
    the inside doesn't die and so instead of dying it sort of maintains it sort of

    about that and I have everything that I need to sort of survive my life and I'm

    carots are little little goopy things with organ we believe that the organel were
    like proc carots eating each other and then sort of like you know making up after
    that anyways this goes on for quite some time until eventually the all the little
    goopy guys decide to maybe we should band together and form such things that we
    might call multicellular life now the first multicellular life as far as I understand
    it we're like uh tube worms I think that's like sponges and tube worms because
    at the bottom of the ocean all the action apparently happens at geothermal Vents
    and that's the place where all the weird chemistry on the inside of the planet
    spews out into the warm liquid water ocean which is protected from the hor horrible
    radiation and sort of uh what they called meteorite of of the outer world and

    we form little spires and we just live our happy lives for quite some time as
    tube worms at the at some geothermal vent at the bottom of some ocean somewhere
    on the planet Earth um again we are kind of going to be this is if you ever if
    you if you check my work I'm sure you'll find some places where the story doesn't
    quite line up with what I'm saying but in the manner of cartoons I I I I have
    done my own due diligence that if you did look up the details and you got those
    extra layers of of specificity you would understand why this cartoon is the one
    I showed you and not some other cartoon and you would say oh well he was missing
    some of the details he must not have realized this new research or this subtle
    Factor but two BMS on geothermal vents under the water is our current best guess
    of what's going on now at some point in this process one of these guys has a terrible
    idea which is that I think it's time to leave the geothermal vent and move around
    the world and if I'm going to do that I'm probably going to need something resembling
    a nervous system so in the sort of esops fable kind of just so story version of
    of evolution of life one of these tube worms kind of popped off and just became
    sort of a regular worm there's a lot of stuff I'm skipping here um but this regular
    worm there's also different branches of the Tree of Life where things sort of
    went off in different directions and some of these guys became like corals and
    stuff like that but the ones that we personally care about that we have a personal
    affiliation for are the wriggly wriggly worms and the wrigly worms um had a very
    good invention a really great idea I think one of the best ideas in history of
    life which is if you're a tube you're pretty much just a mouth and so if you're
    just a mouth then that's really also that's it's it's a it's a single purpose
    entry exit point you have an inside you have an outside and that's about it worms
    came along and they said I have a great idea let's have that tube go all the way
    through and let's separate our our concerns we have inut we'll kind of call this
    a mouth then we're going to have some other guy that we let things out through
    we'll come up with a name for that later and this is now we have worm good old
    worm when you are in other classes they talk about sea elegans and things like
    that it's these kind of guys um they have neurons um we've had sort of enough
    specialization for wor for neurons at this point um and they have something that
    we would call a nervous system because the

    yeah but it there's nothing here that we would call like a central nervous system
    like there's no we don't have spines yet we don't have limbs yet we just have
    something which is capable of sensing the world and then performing actions on
    the basis of that information the first arguably likely chemo sensation um that's
    the sense sens s sensation in detection of chemical gradients in the environment
    we would refer to that as smell or taste um so if you walk into a room and you
    smell something you're picking up on a chemical gradient that you that is sort
    of different enough from your regular environment that you're like oh there's
    a smell it's coming from over there I wonder what it is probably some weird biology
    cuz that's makes volatile organic compound um and so these little wling worms
    honestly that that sensation was happening at the single cell part of this story
    like they they wle towards chemical gradients because that's how they find food
    um this is also um and actually I think this was also a UK carot thing uh somewhere
    in this process you have the very first beginnings of the evolution of vision
    as some things planked in style things start develop light sensitive patches on
    themselves and those light sensitive patches coupled with some kind of a uh motor
    local motor system um which in the water doesn't have to be very much it could
    just be a buoyancy bladder um allows them to float upwards when the sun is out
    and then sink downwards when Night Comes so they can float towards the surface
    of the water when the sun is out so they can do photosynthesis whatever they're
    up to um and then they can sink down Into the Depths at night so they can avoid
    Actually I don't even think we had really Predators at that point but light sensitive
    patches on single cell your organisms that's the origin of the kind of the weird
    chemistry I've talked about before all the opsin and all those like the weird
    photochemicals in the back of your eye uh owe themselves to the weird chemistry
    that developed these guys back here yeah yes so so here we are now we have some
    pretty good stuff we've got cells we've got neurons we've got light sensitivity
    we've got some kind of a motor system we've got a world which is increasingly

    probably you know we're still in kind of the B territory so we're in billions
    of years of just kind of like wiggling around is weird goop and worms and tubes
    and sponges and stuff like that and then at some point uh this is another one
    that I really wish I I I had written the number down here uh there's a strange
    event that happens um so we're evolving things like shells and stuff like that
    um just like structure for our bodies under the water um and then in the in the
    fossil record it's there's a very very clear moment where all of a sudden there's
    life everywhere and it gets and it gets real weird and that moment is called the
    Cambrian explosion so Cambria is like if you're looking through cuts of rock you
    know farther down you go the farther back in time you are and there's at some
    point in this you just start seeing fossils everywhere and you get this strange
    type of rock called fossiliferous Limestone when I was at UT UT University of
    Texas at Austin um Texas used to be the bottom of an ocean and they have buildings
    made out of this fossiliferous Limestone just like you know big buildings and
    walls that's just like nothing but thick thick um fossils of you know things like
    B Valves and shells and you know strange things like that um and it is thought
    that the reason for this big explosion of biodiversity bi biological density and
    bi biological diversity was the creation of what is if the invention if the separation
    of concerns of the tube is the best invention probably the worst invention is
    the creation of predation um because before this time I think there was like people
    were still going around eating each other like I think just that's kind of a thing
    that would happen um but at some point you start to see the the beginning of the
    Predator prey arms race where the Predators start to realize that you know I can
    actually if I just I don't have to spend all my time trying to like do photosynthesis
    and all that kind of stuff if I just learn how to eat the things that can generate
    their own energy and so I'm just going to start really specializing in all the
    this the tools that I need to eat other animals and the and other animals become
    prey and they say well I'm going to have to sort of develop defenses against those

    this sort of Predator prey Dynamic starts to really Drive The evolutionary process
    into over overdrive and it is thought that the sort of the explosion of biodiversity
    that happened in the Cambrian explosion coincides with the original development
    of that Predator prey dynamic um in the animal kingdom um somewhere around this
    time this progresses for a while I believe at this point we're still kind of thinking
    mostly in terms of like B valves and gastropods and maybe some sort of worm like
    objects uh some of those worm like objects be sort of Branch off at roughly this
    time and become the seapods eventually seapods are things like cuttlefish and
    octopus and stuff like that very very intelligent animals that are have a very
    very distantly related to us so they still have things like opsins and stuff like
    that in their retina um but they don't have a lot of the other stuff that we that
    every other animal that has anything we would call intelligence has um because
    we have this yeah yeah we on Earth we do have another animal that we can look
    at that has evolved intelligent life life and it does have we we do have the same
    lineage at some point we have to go real far back to find it so that's one of
    the reasons why I have just like this deep Abiding Love of seapod Neuroscience
    because they are the closest thing we are likely to get to studying an alien Intelligence
    on the planet Earth um this is also around the time somewhat after this time um
    I don't know exactly when this is where you start to get a bunch of like really
    weird animals in in the in the floating around in the water um there's like you
    can look them up there's a lot of weird ones they got like weird and tenna and
    there's just like one like it's got like a buzz saw for a mouth um and just like
    strange animals swim around most of which didn't survive uh to the modern day
    a notable exception being uh horseshoe craps like horseshoe crabs and tryes they've
    been um like they're from this point in time uh or sort of around that time and

    jawless fish is a lam pre Lam pre look like this they're horrible but they are

    that that might be this this is getting below my depth of the details but if I
    had to guess I would guess that they probably came onto the scene around like

    blood so they must they probably came later they're like they're Predator they're
    like a a pred a parasite so they probably came later after there was something
    to suck blood from but they do look very similar um and these guys have a ver
    a a spine a spinal cord traveling down them um I I don't know if they have bones

    would sort of call something similarish to our own um a lot of things like clams
    and muscles have ey stocks they have you know uh photosensitive chemicals and
    little sort of optical objects um but these guys have proper eyeballs and um in
    this paper which is one of my favorite papers ever uh they talk about Mike Land
    talks about um there's evidence get out of here this is a this is a book chapter
    not a paper um there's evidence that this that even at this level of evolution
    450 million years ago these guys probably had eye movement patterns that are similarish
    to our own they they appear to have eye muscles um and they appear to have the
    sort of the the the Machinery necessary to have something like the vestibular
    ocular reflex which is the thing that I've harped on quite a lot about where if
    you move your head your eyes counter rotate talked about how ancient it was talked
    about how old it was talked about how you can't you can't lose V without also
    being dead um it's this old at least this old and the reason again in the cartoon
    asops Fable version of the story for that is that is all the same reasons why
    I said we need stuff like that like options are slow it it takes a while for them
    to respond to light and so if they're going to be able to form an image they have
    to have a mechanism for stabilization um and so because these opsin are in the
    billions of years old that chemistry has been around for you know that's that's
    that's from like goop era um if once you get to the point where you have animals
    that are forming detailed images of the world you have to have that coupled with
    a mechanism for stabilizing that gaze relative to the world so this same kind
    of so this paper just sort of goes through uh and looks at a bunch of animals

    millions of years we're still we're still zooming in very very very narrowly on
    just the the barest crust of history that we are actually a part of um so at some

    very famous animation um Sean Cosmos Evolution GIF that so this this whole story
    that I've been talking about of sort of like the evolution that kind of this whole
    history thing is kind of a play on the Sean version of this which he calls the
    cosmic calendar um where he goes through okay imagine that the history of the
    universe is this 300 65 day calendar where were we at this different points of
    the calendar if I maybe in the future I'll like remember those dates and use that
    same same stick um but this is so this is from the the show Cosmos which was a

    is related to the tree like the tree part so I guess the first ones are kind of
    more I think they're more like possum like was the original mammals but I could
    be wrong but we specifically emerged from the tree shoes that were sort of living
    in the trees and that's where you get you know they were arboreal creatures so
    they lived in trees which means that because they are or Boral they're walking
    around on branches and because they are walking around on branches their main
    appendages are grabby and so you start to develop at even at this era of evolution
    a very tight coupling between the perceptual system and the motor system because
    we're we're we're squirrels we're running around on branches we're we're grabbing
    and moving and things like that so again in the uh just so story of evolution
    it makes sense that we would currently have such a tight coupling between our
    perceptual and Upper Limb appendage system because we emerged our our local motor
    system required us to have a very sort of tight perceptual motor Loop um and then
    we get some more of this stuff which we're going to talk about in some detail

    molecules do given 12 billion years of evolution leave hydrogen alone for long

    is that that's not a well formed question because humans are too complex to have

    know an interesting um comparison there because in general chimpanzees are quite

    their testes are more judiciously sequester in a post penal budge in contrast

    the bipedality makes them extraordinarily vulnerable during upright combat it
    seems illogical to attribute habitual uprightness to weapons that would demand
    even greater selection for testy sequestration than is present in other primates

    the cacophony of homos uh where there was a lot many many different homed species
    just all over the place turns out it's a pretty solid body plan um and this is
    us this is homo neander Talis hiber hius Homo erectus which homoerectus was the
    first like bipedal skeleton which is why they called it that and then they they
    kept finding older stuff so like the the name is no longer quite where it wanted
    to be uh Homo habilis is one of my personal favorites homo tool user we were using
    tools before this um but you know they kind of like they the names are given at
    the time that they find the skeleton so they find um strata in the rocks of like
    suggesting tool use around this time um and yeah yeah and then and then they all
    then they all left they all they're all they all died somehow it's a little bit
    that's like another one of the strange Mysteries is all the other all of our homo
    friends died uh and it was just it was just us um there's evidence genetic evidence
    that we we absor abbed the homo neander Talis um rather than killing them uh they
    were bigger than us um at a time when we were kind of going through an Ice Age
    so that's a time when big things that have to eat a lot die faster than small
    things that went around so um there was some evidence that we were we were hanging
    out together and we probably did kill each other a lot but we also had uh more
    productive relationships that led to us being more and them not being around yeah
    so like around time all those yeah relationships between probably yeah it's rough
    I mean because we're talking so from from here back to AF forensis this is like
    78 million years so this is this is a long time and you know we're basically in
    this era like little bipedal like you know ape

  text: men running around with sharp rocks and we were probably just bashing apart
    whoever we found cuz that's that's how nature is you know so um we but we really
    don't know so in this era so we find stone tools from this era and they they also
    have a cool evolutionary story where the the quality of the stone tools progresses
    kind of linearly um from like oh here's a rock and a place that it really shouldn't
    be um at some point we kind of figured out that like some rocks are better for
    bashing than others at other and at some point later we found out that if you
    smash the rock apart some parts of it become sharp um and we would find these
    places where they would like they would they they seem to just go find they had
    like a chunk of rock that they liked and when they needed to cut something up
    they would just smash It On The Ground pick up the flakes that are sharp use it
    for what they needed to do and then just kind of keep smashing um but there wasn't
    a lot of plan to it and then over time you could see that they would sort of have
    more and more sophisticated tools coming out um until eventually you get to the
    point where they're like they're doing like complicated Flakes and sort of like
    breaking it off and having more like coherent stone tools and stone blades up
    to the point of like the kinds of like Stone tipped um Spears and arrows that
    you would associate with like early humans and then we kind of just got better
    and better at refining our stone tools until eventually they became things like
    this this is a very complex Stone tool that we used from smashed apart rocks that
    we found on the ground so kind sapiens yeah yeah there's this kind of story of
    like telling the story of evolution is a a cop yeah popular narrative like see
    all yeah MH yeah and I mean we we have a pretty big head um I guess I should pull
    this out before I lose time um so this is this is Skelly the skeleton and and
    what there not nearly enough time left Skelly seem better days but I don't think
    I don't know if that part closes um so we have a pretty big brain case um but
    Meander Halls had bigger um and main part and I'm not going to have time for this
    I'm going to have I'm going to have to shuffle around some some class stuff so
    I have more time to talk about Skelly because I dragged him all the way here from
    JP um so we'll

  text: talk about we'll talk about it in more details but I will leave you not entirely
    leave you but I will leave you with this um so if you look at most mammals have
    a ridge on the top of their skull so like if you pet a dog just you'll feel like
    there's a ridge there cats to some extent um course gorilla skull and most other
    animals have um this thing oh that's called the sagittal Crest the sagittal Crest
    is a muscle attachment point so the red on this skeleton Is tendon attachment
    because your muscle doesn't attach to Bone they're tendon attach to the Bone and
    you can see on the side of the skull oh buddy You' had better days haven't you
    um I bought this in like a thrift store I like saw it like through the window
    and I was like so these things cost like this this thing probably cost like $800
    new um I CAU this one I got for like $300 which I probably could have argued down
    but I always feel weird haggling in America so I just bought it with the price
    they said um the so this this muscle attachment here on the side of your skull
    like if you put your hand on the side of your head and like like squeeze your
    jaw like just squeeze your teeth together you'll feel the muscles moving in your
    jaw muscle there and we have a pretty wimpy uh we have a pretty wimpy um bite
    as far as animals go that was the whole SEC thing that love jooy was talking about
    like we kind of suck at biting for mammals especially for Apes um but if you kind
    of Imagine taking that that part of your muscle that wimpy skull and push it together
    until your fingers meet that's kind of what you get here so we so your jaw muscles
    come from the Jaw they go through your uh your cheekbone and then they attach
    on the side of your skull and so if you're an animal that relies on its bite you
    want that attachment point to be as you want those those muscles to be as big
    as they can be and you want those attachment points to be nice and strong um so
    we over the course of uary time kind of gave up on that strategy and so now if
    you kind of Imagine one of these yeah these are all gorillas um if you imagine
    kind of like taking this and sort of blowing it up like a balloon you basically
    get what's left here so instead of having the really hard strong attachment points
    through on that top of the head you now get these kind of like wimpy diffuse attachment
    points spread out over the side of the skull um but you get much much more room
    to to stuff a lot of brains in and so

  text: this is kind of part of that so this is part of the thing that that love joy
    was kind of talking about was trying to make sense of us giving up our greatest
    weapon of of of strong bites and then this argument that oh we must have done
    that because we already had weapons um but then the other argument around pendulous
    comes in um and that's about where that story uh ends not not really ends goes
    a lot of places but that's where I'm going to stop talking about it um so I'm
    running out of time and I have more that I want to say about um the pelvis and
    the feet and the knees and all that kind of stuff because in my previous life
    I was a Locomotion focused scientist um but well I'll leave it here in the sense
    of um talking about the the tool use thing and The evolutionary record and kind
    of this this origin of humanity um that sort of comes about and again that kind
    of story around where we like what what was it like to be a human back in the
    early early stages of humanity um and so one of the things that they found was
    and so like I and I think that one of the things that that really kind of for
    me gives me the best view of what was going on back then was from the stuff that
    we could find from the fossil record which mostly refers to the tools um which
    were mostly rocks and things like this and you getting getting from simpler stuff
    like this to more complex stuff like this um but you also find the bones themselves
    which are sometimes just kind of you know the problem with fossils is that they
    don't happen very often they have to have a very specific set of circumstances
    for a fossil to occur and so the bones that we find are sort of like random and
    like you know things like Lucy are you know very indicative of a like that's that
    was a very big find um and so and there's two kind of and so some but sometimes
    we find things like burial sites and you find burial sites for animals for other
    homos that were not us things like homon naldi um was a relatively recent discovery
    and there was a relatively recent like within the past I say couple of years discovery
    of a of a burial site that they would find that they would they would bring their
    dead to this place and it was deep in this cave so they were they were like these
    guys which were basically like little you know like tiny little monkey men or
    monkey folk I suppose um were

  text: were taking their dead down into this cave and putting them in a particular
    chamber for some reason you know what would they they they probably didn't speak
    English but they had some reasoning for it and they would take they would go back
    to it and we would find animals in particularly um once you start talking about
    Homo sapiens which modern the the modern sapen sort of shows up around 200,000
    years ago so anything from now to 200,000 years ago you pick one of them you put
    them here raise him in a good school identical to us genetically the same um so
    we find bones of old Homo sapiens and old uh home on theer Talis and sometimes
    we find them in burial sites but we also would find them they were always busted
    up like they hurt themselves a lot and one of the one of the primary human superpowers
    apparently relative to other animals on the Earth is our healing Factor like we
    heal very very effectively and very very fast relative to most other mammals um
    and this is this is of note because if we've ever known anyone who has broken
    a bone healing really fast from a broken bone is still kind of slow like it still
    takes weeks and months before you are up to speed again and we would find old
    forms old skeletons here covered in broken bones like they broke their bones all
    the time they live very rough lives and if they had broken bones and if they were
    still surviving to adulthood that means that somebody was taking care of them
    when they were injured they weren't thrown out because they weren't useful they
    were cared for and uh nursed back to health and there are some I don't I wish
    I had more details on this but there are some cases where they would find skeletons
    of of old homos um um that were that were um like twisted like like the like the
    limbs were twisted and not straight um as if they were they were born with a bone
    disorder and but the animal the creature that had that bone disorder still survived
    to adulthood which means that somebody was taking care of them and they took care
    of them for a years they this what whoever they were they were not pulling their
    weight in terms of like huning and Gathering so if were if they were able to survive
    to adulthood it's because someone else in their clade found more value in them
    than what they could bring to the table in terms of their raw physical capacity
    we would also find things like sometimes you would find these kinds of rocks um
    and they would be made out of things like like rose quartz just like uh rocks
    that are not necessarily good for tools but they were just like pretty and we
    apparently liked we still we like pretty Rock rocks and they would find these
    rocks but they wouldn't find them out and about they would find them in burial
    sites so

  text: someone had a hominid friend who died who had their favorite Rose quart and
    rather than taking this rare special rock with them they put it in the ground
    with their dead friend and I think that that is something in this last 30 seconds
    of class it's something I I go back to think about things like that a lot and
    I think about those sort of those Origins and that kind of story and what that
    says about like whether or not we have any hope in the present moment because
    there's a lot of stories that people like to tell around how harsh and horrible
    and rough it is in the world and how Only the Strong Survive and empathy as weakness
    and things like that but it's really not like if you go deep down into the bones
    of the fossil record empathy is the original superpower that allowed us to sort
    of take down mastadons and survive extinction of and sort of make it to the place
    that we are today so I think I am I guess legally obligated to leave it at that
    um I will bring this guy back out at some point in the future so I can talk about
    uh what Co love joy called the most phenetically distinct osteological structure
    in the animal kingdom otherwise known as the pelvis um not the skull the pelvis
    um but I other than that I will leave it at that and I hope yeah I hope there
    I was able to scrape that back to something resembling uh relevance to the current
    topic um and I hope I don't I hope that's not the only time you look into that
    story because everything I just said is just little tidbits that you really should
    pull those threats talk to the bot Google around about it whatever thing I said
    that you're like oh that's interesting dig in CU there's there's a lot more there
    and I guess this class is supposed to be about uh how to become like a real scientist
    type person and to do that it means joining that conversation and joining it in
    the context of the full story so we'll leave that there and
