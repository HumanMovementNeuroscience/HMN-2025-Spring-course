full_transcript: we're recording now um so to repeat that um the the proper assignment
  like the the proper proper like poster proposal assignment will be on uh like a
  one or two sentence right up on the topic area that you're going to want your poster
  to be on and a singular citation of a paper that kind of represents what that research
  what what what that like research in the area that you're going to be presenting
  on um um the standard assignment for 22.99 is that you're supposed to pick a singular
  paper for the whole semester and then your poster is going to be you presenting
  just that paper um I think we can go a little bit beyond that if that's all you
  want to do that's totally valid um but I think we can do a little bit more broad
  of a of an overview um and uh but to keep us kind of honest we're just I'm going
  to ask you to to pick a singular paper and then the the bot me mediated conversation
  will be sort of designed to help you do that so if you you know give it say here's
  the topic I want to study um here's a paper I'm thinking about here's the abstract
  um I'll prompt I'll make the bot prompted to kind of like ask you the kind of questions
  um that you know I would ask you if I have the time and energy to kind of sit down
  and talk about it um behind the curtain when they talk about this class uh the most
  of what they tell us to do is try to help you guys not pick a review article for
  your paper and to pick an actual proper like Empirical research article like because
  it's really it's like like if you just go search for papers on a given topic you're
  going to find review articles at the top of that list and it's not always super
  obvious whether you're looking at a review article or a book chaper or like an empirical
  study um so I can tell the bot to help you with that uh and it'll do things like
  asking you about the methodologies and topics and stuff like that so just kind of
  like helping you kind of like parse the very very dense language that an abstract
  or scientific papers typically written in um and so then there will be some like
  sort of like simple check boxy style of canvas assignment and then like a Discord
  server based conversation space there um and those will be ostensibly um do um next
  week so end of next week meaning 11:59 p.m. on Sunday before the following Monday
  and if you don't hit that deadline there will be dire consequences um not really
  but it's sort of we wanted to keep kind of in that General Cadence that the that
  we're all kind of like on the same path um and probably probably by the end of this
  next week is when the I will have implemented the stuff where the bot will be kind
  of like keeping track of a profile of your interests and trying to like help in
  the journey that you will take through this General field um but we'll see anytime
  I make a promise about the future just know internally I am screaming um great okay
  off up okay who cares um yes okay let's go ahead and get into it um I know what
  to do methods I realized I forgot um Mo cap tracking Etc okay I also forgot a piece
  of equipment that I intended to bring today uh so I will use this instead someone
  doesn't know how to great that works all righty okay so let us begin the lecture
  proper um so it's been nice for the first part of this class kind of seeing you
  guys talking about your interest in the server you know kind of talking to the bot
  about what you're into and what you want to study and things like that um and I
  I intentionally wanted to have that part happen first before I kind of talk about
  my own talk too much about my own particular sort of map of this space um because
  I I didn't want to uh I wanted to let you guys kind of like think about it for yourselves
  before I came up and did like the like the traditional Professor thing which is
  to tell you here's what this field is and here's what this means and here's what
  the here's what is on topic here's what is off topic um because I generally don't
  think that that's how we should think about intellectual inquiry um and the next
  chunk of time I'm going to give you an overview of this domain of human centered
  Neuroscience um that is mostly related to my own particular history my own research
  background my own the studies that I've done um and anytime that you you know by
  the time that you have sort of lived long enough to have Specialties and personal
  experiences and whatnot you will have sort of charted your own path and trajectory
  Into the Heart of some field or some domain um and for pretty much all of you you
  know for everyone that sort of chooses to follow a route kind of like that um you
  are going to have a sort of unique path like everybody's path is going to be different
  and everybody's sort of the the the topics that are relevant to everybody's interest
  will all will be will be different um so I don't want to present this stuff in the
  sense that in a sense of saying here is everything that matters here is everything
  that is relevant to this topic um I I really want to keep it kind of on that like
  relatively personalized Narrative of these are the topics that are the most important
  for me to be able to study human human perceptual motor Neuroscience in the ways
  that I specifically have learned how to do um and sort of talking about that in
  that Con in that context of like the the the component pieces of my particular specialty
  um and I think the beauty of using sort of AI mediated Tools in a classroom setting
  is that in a traditional class the professor kind of like lays out the curriculum
  lays out the structure lays out the topic area and then you are all kind of constrained
  to follow that structure um and that's largely for practical reasons like it's just
  it's just too hard and it requires too much human labor to like really mediate and
  like sort of navigate the particular um sort of variations of interest of people
  in a room even even a room that is labeled under a particular course title um but
  I think with the AI you know limited though it may be it will always do a do its
  damnedest to sort of make whatever your interests are relevant to the topics that
  I have mandated it should care about um so as I start going through this stuff uh
  just encouraging you to really learn to key in to like your own personal feelings
  of interest in your own personal feelings of like being drawn or snagged or moved
  by some topic or some domain um and you know if you want to follow the trajectories
  that I'm doing that's all well and good but even if you wanted to you wouldn't it
  wouldn't happen that way because that's not how the world Works um and so as I give
  this sort of lecture um my main request for you is to just not let your brain turn
  all the way off I'm going to be talking fast about a lot of sort of topics that
  are going to be relatively unfamiliar um for some of them they might be the first
  time you've heard about it for some of them you might have heard about it before
  uh the goal is not to have you understand everything that I'm saying the goal is
  to just expose you to it um so as I start sort of blah blah bling at you um don't
  get too hung up on whether or not you're following everything just kind of like
  remember the words as much as you can try to let just try to let it wash over you
  I promise you nonzero of it will be attaching um and then when we kind of open things
  back up uh you can start asking the bot asking your neighbors the questions about
  the parts that were the most interesting to you and the part that I have found the
  most gratifying about doing this type of a class is the Discovery every time empirically
  that when I give a lecture on a given topic and then I say to 40 students ask the
  bot about the parts you found most interesting typically what I see from that is
  40 different conversations about 40 different topics and that's really a lot of
  fun um so with that said let us get get into it um unfortunately I I brought I intended
  to bring a um like a tablet so I could like draw like stuff with colors um and I
  brought the tablet but then when I looked for like the the pen part I found I just
  thrown like this like standard pencil into here which I can't even I can't even
  imagine what was going on when I did that so we're just doing we're going to do
  it old school with unfortunately just a singular color but that's okay um let's
  see move over here so was your fault how dare you okay I'll just I'll put it on
  your bill um um um okay so right so the topic of the course is neuroscience the
  the department is biology and most of you as biology majors and whatnot have internalized
  to some degree or another with validity that biology and Neuroscience are things
  are is is Rel is related to things like cells and neurons and wet lab microscope
  types of conversations and stuff like that super valid super good topics good things
  to look at um and all kind of part and parcel with a particular philosophical tradition
  that is so fundamental to the way that we do scientific research in 2025 in Earth
  um that we often don't even think about it and that is the concept of reductionism
  that's not your way um so reductionism is just sort of a general philosophical approach
  to the study of the natural world um which tries to break things down into smaller
  and smaller pieces so that with you can sort of make more and more precise measurements
  and more more precise topics more more precise investigations but this kind of like
  sort of like implicit assumption that at some point there will be that by looking
  at the component pieces of the world you'll be able to get a sense of the istic
  view of how everything works um and there's a lot of validity to that approach but
  there's also obviously a lot of limitations to that um because if you're only looking
  at the small pieces in isolation you never going to see or you're going to have
  a hard time seeing what we call emergent properties which are things that only really
  come about when you look at the the combination of things at a larger scale than
  the kind of things you can put into a test tube and under a microscope um the classic
  example of emergence is traffic um so traffic is a property of cars on a road um
  but you can never understand traffic by looking at a singular car it's something
  that only really comes about when you're looking at the cars operating in their
  natural environment um and so you know the the counter to reductionism is what you
  might call more holism or something like that um but that tends to be the scale
  that my sort of research domain tends to operate in is I I tend not to be like I
  look at the research of the people who are doing the highly reduced sort of like
  electrophysiology studies where they put electrodes into the brains of various animals
  um fmri where they have people in a tube and they're looking at the magnetic resonance
  of their hemoglobin in their brain um but my particular domain of research tends
  to focus on humans behaving in natural environments doing um the kinds of stuff
  that we do in our sort of day-to-day lives so you know like throwing things in the
  air and catching them involves there's a motor behavior of putting Force into the
  marker an information gathering phase and then another motor command which if it
  lines up with the world works out if it doesn't I drop it um and large sort of trying
  to understand that behavioral process um in its natural context and then trying
  to use whatever the best measurements that I can come up with um of those behaviors
  and then trying to attach them to sort of the more low-level reductionist sort of
  um fields of inquiry so that we can have a sense of like you know how the things
  like cells and neurons can lead to complex behaviors like that so I think of it
  as kind of like it's almost like a robotics approach so it's I like to tell people
  that I studi the part of Neuroscience that overlaps with robotics um because robotics
  is another field that kind of like keeps you honest in the sense that it's you make
  things that move around in the real world so you can't really cut that many corners
  so the thing just stops working um and the difference is that the like robots we
  know how they work because we made them but we they can't do all the things we want
  humans we don't really know how they work but they can do pretty much anything so
  there's this kind of combination of those two sort of thinking about the human as
  like a magical meat robot and trying to study it and understand it from the that
  perspective um can lead to a lot of useful results um and the nice thing about that
  is kind of the abstraction away from the biology and from the the the knowledge
  that it is in fact under the hood cells and neurons and you know membrane potentials
  and things like that um and thinking about it more in the terms of the things that
  we can measure um which we will talk about shortly um so let's talk so speaking
  of the natural world let's sort of talk about something which you know is one of
  the ways to parse out that General topic which is what's called the perception Action
  Cycle um so let's start by drawing a brain I'm trying to draw it I'm draw yes let's
  do it like that um so here's how you draw a brain there you go um the sorry try
  and you'll figure it out okay so this is your brain this is a picture of your brain
  that's your temporal lobe this is your eye you're facing that way um and there's
  a lot of details that are not being covered here but this is the general shape so
  here you are that's your that's that's you and you existence in the world and let's
  see let's do this different way there you go that's you you're in the world and
  here here's your body here's your eye here's your mouth and then inside of there
  that's your brain not to scale and so as you are in the world you have a very limited
  awareness of of your given context and the everything that that you know comes in
  through your senses and well your senses in your memory so let's think about a particular
  moment in time where you're sitting here you have your eye and then you see out
  here there's a cat you like cats and so you so the image so light from the sun bounces
  off the cat and goes into your eye and we'll talk a lot about eyes we'll talk about
  the lens we'll talk about the retina we'll talk about the phobia we'll talk about
  the optic nerve um but the most the main thing is that their your eye is the place
  where environmental energy is first absorbed by your nervous system and this moment
  right here is a very special moment in your perceptual cycle which is the moment
  of transduction um which is the term for the moment when some form of environmental
  energy in this case light has gets transduced and converted into neural activity
  in this particular case in your this is your eye the light goes in it goes into
  your retina into your phobia which talk plenty about um there's a particular uh
  class of molecule called opsin opsins look roughly like this this like you know
  um what are they called carbons and hydrogens and then the hexagon and then the
  long the long uh sort of Wiggly tail um the people in Biochemistry this is probably
  familiar shapes except this is not drawn well and then you have a bunch of these
  opsins in your eye um and they're all there's there's basically three main ones
  and they're sort of they're all they they're tuned if you want to use that term
  to different wavelengths of light and they the nature of them is that when a photon
  of light hits them they absorb the energy of that Photon and then change shape and
  I think I actually did this backwards I think they start out with the Kink and then
  when they absorb the light they straighten out um but whatever happens this absorption
  of a photon changes the electrochemical properties of the molecule and it goes from
  being a neutral to a plus one or a minus one or whatever it is um but the point
  is that the the the light that is coming from the environment bouncing off the cat
  entering your eye changing the chemical layout of the opson um and happening in
  the trillions and billions of sort of instances that biology tends to operate in
  um this changes the polarity and the Electrical uh state of the rods and the cones
  in your retina which get sort of you know accumulated with ganglia and various sort
  of other stuff um and leads to a shift in the uh electrical potential in the in
  that section of your retina that then gets sent in as spikes down your optic nerves
  neurons are the things that Neuroscience is made of and mostly what neurons do is
  they Spike they send little electrical pulses and that's how they communicate that
  whatever that neuron has tuned to has has occurred um and for a for a for perception
  for vision it's this absorption of light into the opson and the and the shift in
  this polarity and then the change in that electrical state that leads to a change
  in the um what's the term uh the spike rate of of a given gangan cell as it is sending
  its axon down the optic nerve into your um optic the occipital lobe and the the
  visual cortex um and so we're going to talk more about this in more detail and more
  coherence um but the important thing here is that the light that has been absorbed
  by your eye that is then gets converted through this strange biochemical machine
  into a pattern of neural activity uh because the neural activity is caused by the
  light and because the light has been reflected off the object in question there
  is a general belief and assumption um that that the pattern of neural activity has
  somehow has some relationship with the object in the real world there's some statistical
  correlation there's some relationship and the pattern of neural activity somehow
  encodes information about the world that you're looking at um the nature of that
  relationship is tenuous and complex um and generally speaking extremely impoverished
  like the actual information we're getting in any mo One Moment In Time is far less
  than you think it would be it's a lot but the richness of your visual environment
  for example is very much an illusion based off of your brain's ability to sort of
  Cobble together a lot of noisy information to give you something that's sort of
  accurate enough to move through the world but often in almost exclusively designed
  sort of like after the fact um so that's your brain again um it's more like a ma
  brain but that's fine so your optic so the light comes into your eye gets absorbed
  by the retina which is on the back of your eye sends a pattern of neural activity
  down your optic nerve um passes through some subcortical areas and the thalamus
  and stuff like that which we'll talk not that much about that part but there is
  some stuff that happens here um and then projects down to the occipital lobe which
  is otherwise known as the visual cortex which is in the back of your brain um not
  super important to know where it is but it's just just kind of like one of those
  things like it's like Vision happens here for in the back for whatever reason um
  and so this is the place where the first kind of like the first pass of information
  about your visual environment sort of starts to get computed and it's mostly in
  the form of like edges and dark patches light patches you know and stuff like that
  and once you get from V1 which is primary visual cortex it goes through other stages
  of processing that lead to sort of more and more complex you know um structures
  to emerge so like you start with things like edges and then if you have enough edges
  you can get patches and if you get patches then you can get textures and if you
  get textures you can get objects and that sort of like each stage of visual processing
  Builds on the stage before um to sort of eventually lead to the ability to do things
  like object recognition of like oh that thing out there is a cat there's a there's
  a conversation we can have about like like the the parts of that process that go
  down this lobe which is your temporal lobe which is here um tends to be the sort
  of object space of like that's a desk that's a computer um and then the part that
  we tend to care more about in this class is the part that goes up this direction
  um which tends to be more in tune of using that information to plan your movement
  out in the world um something that I haven't said I think yet but probably but is
  something that bear is repeating is obviously this is a cartoon this is a very abstracted
  simplified version of a story which if you wanted to tell the whole story you would
  have to tell a thousand thousand stories of a thousand thousand humans in their
  Labs recording data getting a bunch of numbers and then making up their own stories
  and the discussion sections of their own papers about what the different parts mean
  and then this kind of cartoonified story is the version that tends to make it into
  the textbooks that we T sort of communicate back to you and sort of try to make
  sense out of any of it but I think it's really important that we remember that this
  is not the real story this is the cartoon and the real story is something that we
  don't actually have access to there is no there's no level like of of class where
  I can just give you the book that says here is what the visual cortex is actually
  doing the best I could ever do is just to give you a record of all the empirical
  measurements that all the humans who have ever investigated this man to put together
  and then tell you the story that we have collectively decided is the best story
  that we can come up with for how we think this part of this lumpy pink thing inside
  of all of our skulls is operating um but yeah but that's not there is a gap an essential
  gap between epistemology which is our knowledge of things and metaphysics which
  is what actually exists uh and the two things never truly touch there is always
  going to be a difference between knowing something and what that thing actually
  is and in the history of science we have told many many many stories about what
  we think is going on in the world and in our bodies and in our goopy bits um and
  historically over time every single one of those stories on a long enough time scale
  is proven wrong in some sense everything we currently think think will eventually
  be proven wrong in some way or another um evidence for that being everything we've
  ever thought up until this point has been proven wrong in some way or another um
  so as you think there's something special about today that's going to keep happening
  um indefinitely until the sun burns out but the beauty of the scientific process
  in some sense is that we have this belief that even though everything has been wrong
  there is a sense that each success of idea is less wrong than the one before it
  and less wrong means that it allows us to make more precise predictions it allows
  us to heal sickness better it allows us to build machines that do more exciting
  things um sometimes those improvements happen by completely throwing around throwing
  out philosophical sort of like base level beliefs about how certain things work
  um but yeah it's a continuous process we'll talk about it um yes so so here we are
  in this cycle you the light has bounced off the cat it's hit your eye it's been
  absorbed it's been transmitted back to your visual cortex um you have identified
  that it's a cat and you have a an inbuilt volition that says I like to touch cats
  great we support this for you so this is the parietal lobe don't worry about the
  parietal lobe it's it's great but you can worry about it if you want um but the
  important sort of okay so this back here is your visual cortex um this on the side
  here roughly speaking is your motor cortex and So eventually you start as you as
  you look in more and more pictures of the brain you will and you can look at this
  directly the the the wrinkles and stuff on the brain are not random they are conserved
  in the same sense that while every face that we have looks very different they generally
  have two eyes and a nose and a mouth and just in different kind of configurations
  the wrinkly stuff and the the crevices and bumps and stuff on her brain roughly
  the same like if you were to crack open all the brains in this room which I don't
  recommend um you would find a lot of Correspondence in where the the big um creases
  and stuff come in um and I am not at the level of that anatomy where I can name
  them off the top of my head um but I do recognize them in pictures and that's how
  you can kind of it's easy to tell when someone is drawing a brain artistically versus
  when they're looking at Anatomy because artists and whatnot often just say oh yeah
  it's a bunch of like pink wrinkles and then you just sort of it's like okay well
  that's not that's not actually how we do but anyways there's a big one right in
  the mirror called the central sulcus sulcus is like the crease part and on this
  side of that sulcus is the somato sensory cortex somat sensation is like basically
  touch like think that this type of sensation um and on that side is the motor cortex
  so the n sensory cortex and then the motor cortex and they tend to be paired and
  you can look up I'll you we'll look up the huny LI when we talk about the motor
  cortex um but I kind of it's It's I enjoy this distinction and kind of like there's
  these two sides of the brain where on this side of the brain it's kind of like sensation
  and sort of the the perception of the world like visual aspects and this the sort
  of sensory aspects and then on this side of the brain is where we start getting
  to like motor actions and movements and kind of the outgoing parts of things um
  and as we sort of keep going forward you eventually get over here to the frontal
  loes um the frontal lobe is like the big lumpy part in the front that's the like
  the the the most human part of the brain all Maman brains are roughly the sort of
  same anatomically they're just very fun mirrored into different sort of shapes and
  sizes like you know rats have a much more pronounced Factory bulb for smell versus
  their visual cortex and the human brain has a has a lot of extra Anatomy on that
  frontal lobe area this is thought to be kind of where decision making comes from
  this is where sort of like language kind of lives and often in it's um referenced
  in uh like executive function so that the feeling of like deciding what you want
  to do this is also where like metacognition happens so if you're having thoughts
  about your thoughts like oh yeah I'm angry right now like that's a that's a frontal
  loby area and and just reiterating the point every time I point to a part of the
  brain and I say this is the part that does this thing a little part of me inside
  is screaming and dying because none of this is how any of it that like that's that's
  the cartoon that's not how the real world is set up it's much more complex than
  that it's much noisier than that but it's if I say this is where executive function
  happens and I point at the front of the brain and then this is where Vision happens
  and I point at the back of the brain that statement is more true than if I switch
  those two things around so just it's important to reiterate that even though I am
  telling you these simplified stories these sort of textbook level conversations
  about how the brain is this is the stuff that if we come back to this class in 250
  years we're going to be saying very very different things but we'll probably still
  say something like the vision happens in the back and the cognition happens in the
  front anyways um from this frontal lobe from the you get sort of the frontal area
  executive functions then you get your premotor area and somewhere around here is
  where volitions arise volition is sort of same route as voluntary it's like the
  things that you want to do so you see you see the the cat and you say I want to
  touch the cat here is the cat and look at me I'm touching it and that's this is
  what I want to happen and so now you are in this state where here's your body here
  here's your hand there here's this cat there and here's this desire that I sure
  wish that my hand part was on this cat part um and this sort of and now there's
  a a gap between the way that the world is in your perception and the way the world
  that wish the way that you wish the world would be which is that your hand was sort
  of touching this object okay so those volitions kind of meld with uh the perceptual
  experience and from this sort of alchemy emerges something resembling a motor plan
  um we're going to I'm trying to stop myself from going to some of these details
  because I am going to have like like we're going to have a whole lecture about the
  eye we're going to have a whole lecture about the motor cortex we're going to talk
  about this in more detail I'm just giving the overview uh but um but yeah but this
  is where we would call something the first time we start seeing something resembling
  a motor plan there's a lot of times in the chats y'all have been having where you
  talk about things like muscle memory um which is the sort of muscle memory is kind
  of like the uh it's a term we like to use it's like a very standard human expression
  um but it's also one of the things that like it doesn't really exist in a physiological
  sense like your Mo your muscles don't have memory they're much simpler object which
  we will talk about muscles too um usually what you mean when you say muscle memory
  is motor plan um and as you sort of work on something more and more and you get
  more expertise more experience that's the that that what we tend to refer to as
  motor as muscle memory is really like the motor plans kind of becoming more robust
  and more sort of locked in um and typically where a lot of that kind of motor planning
  takes place is not necessarily in the motor cortex um but most of that starts happening
  in subcortical regions um so if you think about a picture of the brain and you think
  about the that pink wrinkly thing in your skull that's T tends to be what we think
  about that's your cortex that's the um neocortex it's the part where most of the
  processing happens um which we'll talk a little about what processing means in this
  context um but it is I like to I like to talk about this as like that is the it's
  like that's kind of like the the bloom of the rose on the rose bush like when you
  think about the nervous system and you're looking at when you're looking at a rose
  bush it makes a lot of sense that we tend to focus on the rose like the red thing
  with petals and that smells nice and we spend a lot of our time focusing on that
  part of the plant in for very good reason but if you really take a step back and
  look at it from a b botney point of view it's mostly Bush and just a little bit
  of row and I think that's it's kind of the same with the way our cortex works um
  the majority of our central nervous system is not in that cortex it's in the subcortical
  regions and among my favorite of those subcortical regions is the cerebellum which
  it look sort of sits at this looks kind of like this fist shaped thing that sits
  right below your cortex when you look up pictures of the brain online you'll see
  the big pink wrinkly thing you see this kind of more dense sort of like grayish
  looking thing underneath it um that's your cerebellum your cerebellum is a very
  complicated Beast um it contains about 3.5 times as many neurons as the rest of
  your central nervous system combined um and that number is sort of strangely conserved
  across different animals like all animals mammals particular just because I don't
  know about the other guys um we all have cortex we all have cerebellum we have very
  different brain to body ratios and different sort of proportions there but in General
  however big your brain is whatever animal you are your cerebellum is has three and
  a half times as many neurons as the rest of your cortex um which is one of those
  things like I I always sort of come back to that it's sort of like that just seems
  anytime you find a number in nature that's conserved across a bunch of different
  stases it's just kind of like that seems like an interesting thing I wish I knew
  more about it um so your cerebellum the part of the reason why has so many more
  like neurons by by count is that the neurons in associated with it are teensy teensy
  tiny they are you have granual cells and you have pingi cells um which I W I'm going
  to look up pictures this because ah uh Peri cells oh do I have internet here yeah
  yeah preni cells in your cerebellum are like one of the more beautiful parts of
  the nervous of your of your brain it's kind of you have the cell body you have the
  axon and then these are all the synapses and all of there's thousands upon thousands
  of them um this picture is famous this was actually taken by not picture but it's
  um this is from pinji the guy who sort of like he he created was it oh sorry kahal
  uh says right there um Ramon kahal who yeah um was part of the sort of group that
  came up with the staining mechanisms that allowed us to sort of start looking at
  neurons in their isolation that happened in roughly 1909 before that we didn't really
  know what neurons were and didn't know if they were just one big mass or if they
  were individualized pieces and there was like a big scientific and philosophical
  debate about are neur is is the brain all one big connected piece or did the like
  do the do the neurons touch or are they separated from each other and there was
  Ramon Cal who was arguing in the favor of the synapse Doctrine which said that there
  was a gap between them and then there I think it was GOI who was arguing in favor
  of their it's all touching whatever that was called and then um GOI came up with
  like a silver nitrate staining process that allowed them to make images like this
  of looking at cells and ironically by making that staining process prove the Cal
  side of that argument correct and that they tend not to touch and then they both
  got both Ramon Cal and GOI got they shared a Nobel Prize but apparently they had
  such bad blood between them that they both spent their entire speech bashing the
  other guy um so there you go there you got that um but yeah so your so your cerebellum
  is consists of preni cells and then granu cells which in comparison look more like
  this they're they're small and they don't have these super long fibers that sort
  of go very long distances they're much more localized they only connect to their
  immediate neighbors um and the majority of ner of of neurons in your nervous system
  are these granular cells that live in your cerebellum your cerebellum is a layered
  thing um like most parts of your brain it's got kind of like um like the layers
  tend to operate phog gentically so that on the outside is the newest stuff on the
  inside is the older stuff um sellum has that structure we may talk about it I'm
  not sure uh we'll see it's one of those things like if enough people talk to the
  bot and ask about this then I might like I'll be I'll be trying to steer the lectures
  based off the interest of the class um but anyway we're talking about cats um so
  light hit the cat hit your eye absorbed in your retina tweaked your opsins triggered
  a neural Cascade vibrated your visual cortex uh gave you the perception of a cat
  your volitional desire to touch the cat combined with the knowledge that there's
  a cat in front of you and started creating a motor plan which sort of you know this
  is where the cartoon gets really cartoony because it's like there's a lot of controversy
  about like the different steps of this process but long story short something in
  the com combination of your motor cortex and your cerebellum which is your cerebellum
  is largely like a motor based thing like a movement it mostly deals with movement
  of your body um it's thought to be related to like tool use um so this this thing
  that we humans can do where we pick up an object and kind of pretty quickly learn
  the physics of it um and using it as a tool that has certain sort of characteristics
  is thought to be like a neoc thing the Neo is the new part it's on the outside it's
  complicated um but there's a level there's a hierarchical nature of your motor system
  where at the at the higher levels where the top is pretty much like the frontal
  lobe the the the plans are much more abstract so it's things like I'm thirsty um
  I want I wish I was drinking water right now uh and then in order for that high
  level volition to be turned into something that can actually sort of lead me to
  my goal there has to be this sort of like um pairing down of specificity from that
  very high level volition uh down to something which at some level is going to have
  to boil down to muscle fir rings to move my body through space and so as I say oh
  I wish I had water I see that there's water over there and somehow that volition
  is converted into motor commands that move my legs so now my body is in a place
  that I can move my arm I know how this thing works so I open the thing and I get
  to drink water um and so that process tends to go you know from the motor cortex
  then you got the cerebellum then your cerebellum sort of has connections to your
  brain stem I say connections but they're really kind of like they're wrapped around
  each other um so you have your brain stem your medulla oblongata your ponds um that's
  the part of your brain people talk about your Reptilian Brain that's that's that
  part that's the part that handles things like is my heart beating am I breathing
  is my temperature within a livable range that tends to be hanging out and controlled
  at your brain stem um and your brain stem is the start of your spinal cord which
  is another good friend there we go there you go there you perfect nice still you
  good job um and so your spinal cord is a part of your central nervous system often
  times when we think about the spinal cord it's often kind of it's It's given a bad
  W and we tend even when we look at pictures of like if you Google pictures of the
  central nervous system you'll often see pictures that stop here and it's just sort
  of like you know cortico centrism sort of just focused on that that rose on the
  bush and then less to say about you the cerebellum often gets in the picture but
  we often like cut off where the spine is um but your spine is just as much a part
  of your nervous system as the rest of it and the specifically the way that we're
  going to Define central nervous system as opposed to peripheral nervous system is
  uh Loosely that the central nervous system is where processing happens um where
  processing is a very goopy term um that basically means like information is coming
  in being some sort of conversion is happening which we might call a computation
  if we wanted to use like a computer analogy um but it information comes in changes
  form in some way and then information goes out um and the and you're and the the
  spine is doing that kind of of processing um at various levels which we will also
  talk about let me see how we are on time okay on time um but it's in very find it
  kind of fascinating ways and there are some stories that we will talk about later
  in the semester of studies that we aren't allowed to do anymore um on cats where
  you can sever the spine like like cut the spine so it no longer connects to the
  upper part of the brain um and the cat can still do things like walk um because
  the spine is is housing the the gray matter that that does that handles things like
  Central pattern generation and reflex responses um or something like a central pattern
  generator is a thing that handles like the basic rhythmic motion of my legs and
  the thing that says oh well one foot is going to be in stance and the other one's
  going to be in swing and then they're going to sort of swap off um and a lot of
  that processing is handled in the spine itself um your spine goes down your spinal
  cord ends actually around here like right below your thoracic spine I know right
  um and then the stuff below that is what's called like the cotus aquinus which is
  like that's where it does become more um extension Cordy like and you you start
  to lose the gray matter and you get the more just like the peripheral nerves that
  go out to your limbs um yeah the yeah so the peripheral so I also just want to just
  again make that point that that distinction between central nervous system and peripheral
  nervous system is the kind of thing that is often stated as like this is a hard
  delineation um but there's a lot of gray area there one of the most classic gray
  areas is the retina um the retina has a lot of neurons on the back of it and there's
  layers to it and it's often described like we think about the retina like the eye
  sort of like the classical sensory organ um but there's stuff happening on the back
  of the retina before anything even leaves on on that optic nerve pass to the brain
  that really could be considered to be computation um similarly your skin has a lot
  of connections in it that you know might be doing things that we might consider
  computation um that's why like when you get hurt if you like rub rub the thing it
  doesn't hurt as much because the ACT the activity of activating sensory organs around
  the damaged area suppresses the feeling coming from the damaged area and that is
  all happening at the level of your skin um so just again this this these these names
  and terms and whatnot this is not like nature is not design divided into pieces
  with departments and names that's a thing that we humans did to Nature so that we
  could have any hope of making any sense of it but anytime we put a name or a label
  or or a category into nature we're always going to be making concessions and sort
  of we're drawing lines around areas because it allows us to have better conversations
  about those things but there's always going to be gray areas and often times it's
  those gray areas or the cracks that the that tend to lead us to abandon certain
  thoughts and go towards others um okay so speaking of the peripheral nervous system
  um so where I wish had colors uh there you go okay this is your arm that's these
  are your bones and your bones are mostly what you are like if we're thinking about
  it in terms of like the space that you inhabit like the shape that you are your
  general sort of ability to move through the world it's mostly bones um and then
  all the goop that's associated with that is sort of the details but the General
  cookie cutter shape of you as a as a creature is driven by these weird sticks and
  these weird sticks have weird things attached to them called muscles um and yeah
  and So eventually one of the things that happens when you thinking about the sort
  of like more holistic picture of the world and sort of the way that you live in
  it um is be if you're in a lab if you're if you're living this reductionist life
  where you're choosing a particular domain of inquiry um and you're you're sort of
  simplifying and cutting out any extraneous factors that get in your way to to sort
  of zoom in as far as you can on that particular thing um you get to remove all the
  parts of the question that you don't want to look at and so if you're a neuroscientist
  you might have you might take the mouse or the rat or the fruit fly or whoever you
  want to look at into the lab and then just like remove all the parts that you that
  aren't Neuroscience so that you can have a better picture of the neurons that you
  care about when you want to think about when you don't have that capacity and you
  want to think about things more generally um you don't have that um that luxury
  and so if you want to think about how humans move through the world um and even
  if you care mostly about the neural aspects of it even if you care mostly about
  the perceptual aspects of that you are sort of required by the nature of reality
  to consider things like bones and muscles even though those are not particularly
  neural objects um because when we move when when our all this weird neural FL flam
  is eventually going to have to transmit down into something that moves the body
  through the world and this is where we get to the kind of the robotics y conversation
  because um this is the part where the neural activity which has been originally
  transduced into this sensory experience of of vision um all of that sort of combination
  of things is eventually going to get boiled down here to something that sort of
  flips that coin around and now the neural activity is going to be converted into
  environmental energy in this case in the form of mechanical energy so it's going
  to squeeze my muscle and my arm is going to move that muscle my arm is going to
  be move and this is now has there's an there's literal like energy in this movement
  specifically in the form of kinetic energy or you know you know if I'm pulling on
  a spring or something like that might be mechanical energy like potential energy
  kinetic energy spring energy that's the stuff that we get from our muscles and so
  there's that's the whole perception action cycle is this conversion of environmental
  energy into perceptual neural activity down back into a motor action and so your
  muscles are weird objects um and a muscle is effectively a variable stiffness spring
  that's pretty much what a muscle is muscles only pull your muscle can only pull
  on things muscles cannot push if when I when it looks like I'm pushing it's because
  this muscle is pulling on the tip of that bone so that my arm goes that way and
  that that's called extension and then if I want to squeeze this one then I send
  a motor command down there it fires the motor tendon Union GGI body organs and it
  says Hey surrounding muscle tissue contract and so this what was originally a fairly
  Wiggly Soft Spring gets electrified and becomes a rather stiff spring and pulls
  this joint up and this one there's they're paired there's a flexion uh muscle group
  and then there's the extension muscle group and those two things operate in conjunction
  to to move this degree of freedom and that type of so yeah and so that so the motor
  plan that comes down from the motor cortex and sort of through the cerebellum if
  you're a fancy type of an animal like a human it goes through the corticos spinal
  tract which goes there is a sort of connection straight from your motor cortex down
  to your spine bypassing things like your cerebellum all animals have a cortical
  spinal tract but it's really um but not to equal degree um and that's one of the
  interesting distinctions in the animal kingdom is like this is a fun this is one
  of my favorite I actually use this question to test like AI models to see how it
  does at Neuroscience is asking about the cortical spinal tract and how it varies
  across the animal kingdom because that's one of the places where the questions get
  really subtle um and so I can look at how it does at that answer to see like I'm
  looking at like a local model I can run on my computer like the small ones I I can
  watch it get the subtle Parts wrong when I ask it that kind of a question so but
  a lot of stuff I've been talking about about how like motor cortex motor commands
  go through like the cerebellum and the brain stem and stuff like that that is true
  um but there is also this cortico spinal tract anytime you see one of those big
  words with an o in the middle just replace the o with a slash so cortico spinal
  is C cortex SL spinal that just basically go straight from the cortex down to the
  spine bypassing all the subcortical regions um and it's what allows us to be to
  control our individual degrees of freedom of our body directly um as opposed to
  doing things in like it's more synergistic way which is way deeper than I want to
  talk about in this particular lecture cheing that clock it's killing me um so yeah
  so here I am I'm so close I'm so ready to almost touch this cat um and I my motor
  my motor plan which has come down from on high down this sort of hierarchical structure
  of our motor system has uh taken my awareness of the world and my own body so the
  vision gives me information about remote parts of the world things I can not touch
  things that are outside of mine here's a great word peripersonal space the per personal
  space is the area that I can touch with my hands um outside of that is a different
  part of the world that's kind of happening in the parietal Lo one of my favorite
  studies is this like they got a monkey Myck monkey and they trained it to grab things
  on a desk um and then they gave gave it a a temporary lesion so they just like squirt
  something into the part of the brain that handles that peripersonal perception so
  that that part of the brain kind of goes offline um and you get what's called cortical
  blindness so the monkey sort of loses its ability to to see things cartoon cartoon
  um in that per personal Zone then they took the monkeys and they train it to use
  a grabber arm like a little like like claw arm so it now its reach is now farther
  because it can use this arm and when they ask after they teach it how to use it
  and they sort of leion that per personal Zone the blind spot increases to include
  the region that could be reached with the Grabber in addition to the hand um so
  put that into your worldview and see how it fits um so anyways um here I am I see
  this cat and I have this awareness of my body a lot of this is sort of call kind
  of associate that with um proprioception um so like as my arm is out here it is
  uh putting force on my joints because of the weight of the arm and my body can encode
  and is aware of those forces and I can use that to kind of be aware of where my
  arm is I can also see my arm I also have a memory of lifting it up there's a lot
  of ways that we know where our bodies are um but I know that it's here and that
  if I can make this part move that way um then I'll have I will have achieved my
  my my deepest desire of touching this cat um and so there's there's a lot of comp
  complicated stuff about the like we don't move our body one joint at a time we move
  it in the sort of like barely sophisticated dance um and a lot of that the breakdown
  and how we sort of how we choose to to to break down a complex movement across the
  available joints in the context of the world that's a a cerebellum thing again cartoons
  um but let's pretend like it's not and so I I relax what is it so I I relax the
  flexor I tighten the extensor and that puts a torque on this bone which moves my
  hand here and now I have the reward of cat Sensations under my hand and I have now
  achieved this this goal of mine um right and so now and now we have and that's that's
  the loop so that's one path through that perception action Loop because now that
  the information has gone in been processed been sort of whatever and now that I
  have moved my body I have now changed the state of the world like my body is in
  the world so now as I'm perceiving the situation as it stands I'm perceiving something
  different and now I'm going to go back through that Loop and so of you know you
  perceive you act and then you take in the information and you kind of like that
  Loop is tends to be where you live your whole life um and so yeah and so this is
  kind of the cartoon overview of of the story as it as it holds um I will name some
  of the uh the fields associated with the things that we talked about um yeah uh
  generally speaking when we talk about well talking about like the physiology of
  the eyeball tends to be kind of like optology I guess um uh but that's that's more
  like lens and pupil and like the the goopy Parts um once you're talking about like
  the the neural the neural activity aspect of it we tend to call that like visual
  like visual Neuroscience perceptual Neuroscience because we are such Vision heavy
  animals as humans often when you hear perceptual we tend to mean visual um but strictly
  speaking it's all like anything sensory is perceptual um when we start talking about
  the parts of the Neuroscience that are moving your body we tend to call that motor
  Neuroscience you will often hear people talk about perceptual motor Neuroscience
  which again perceptual motor is the same perceptual SL motor and it's kind of like
  it's this connection and this kind of like this reality that the two parts are um
  perception in action and perception in motor control they're sort of intimately
  linked um oh I should mention this too um in your peripheral nervous system you
  have peripheral neurons and your peripheral neurons come in two types there is perceptual
  and there's motor shockingly and that distinction is is defined by basically which
  direction the information is Flowing so a motor command goes out from your central
  nervous system towards your periphery carrying a motor command so this this is a
  a neuron that's connected to a you know motor unit in my muscle and if it gets sort
  of tapped by one of these higher level structures it's going to get spikes that
  are telling it to Fire and that will contract the muscle um once I touch the cat
  what was the object of my plans um there are the the the the the the neurons connected
  to like the sensory um organs in my hand start firing differently and they send
  information back down your sensory peripheral nerves peripheral sensory nerves yeah
  so in your periphery it is just it's out outward stuff is your motor neurons um
  inward stuff is your Sensory neurons and that's kind of the main distinction there
  um again uh just the word cartoons going on there yeah why are you aware what's
  that why you not like aware why are you not aware yeah this is one of I think the
  most troubling realities of being alive is that and this is also part of the the
  standard um existential crisis that classes like this tends to give to people so
  have fun with that um we have a very very thin awareness of what is going on under
  the hood in our bodies and we have we have some awareness we have some conscious
  experience of like I'm going to reach out and grab this thing I'm going to oh yeah
  this feels cool in my hand this feels hard in my hand um but the more you learn
  about neuroscience and the more you learn about what's going on in the Hood the
  more you realize that those sensory that like the cognitive like the the conscious
  personal experience of having a motor experience um is a really really thin layer
  on top of a lot of complexity that's going on and that is unfortunately just like
  the situation that we are in um remember one time I was in grad school and we were
  in like a a parking lot my friends and winter waiting to go on a hike or something
  like that and for some reason this really stuck with me but there was just like
  a puddle of like dirty water in the middle of the parking lot that had this like
  really beautiful like oil sheen on top of it and it was just like the sort of fractal
  iridescent colors just and by the nature of oil it's just like one molecule thick
  that is giving this really beautiful like vibrant colorful shape on top of just
  cold dark murky water and I think about that a lot when I think about the nervous
  system because it just feels like that is kind of our experience of living in a
  body is we have this experience that is sort of riding on top of this really deep
  and complex biological neural complex system and the that conscious Sheen is related
  to the depths of what's going on there but we don't really tend to have access to
  it like I can't feel my stomach deciding when it wants to squirt out more enzymes
  to digest my food and I can't tell the difference between you know parts of this
  thing happening and you know like it's just it's not really available to me there
  are once you start learning about the about the bits and pieces you can start kind
  of mapping on your your conscious experiences to the things that I'm going to be
  telling you is maybe happening under the hood um one of the ones that's coming to
  me right now for whatever reason is like it's kind of a thing that is known where
  when when when a person starts lifting weights for the first time if you've never
  been a weightlifting person there's a a thing that happens where you very quickly
  like you'll shoot up the amount of weight that you can lift in a very short amount
  of time because your body is learning how to fire all of your motor units at once
  and that's just the thing that in your general life you just tend not to do and
  you kind of have to learn how to do that like how to extend like maximal effort
  and that is something that's happening at the level of like recruitment of motor
  units and so if you then if you now go to the gym and you start having that experience
  you sort of feel oh yeah I'm getting super strong and it's just kind of like you
  can map that experience onto this thing I just said about how your motor units work
  but it's in but that mapping is in the this like weird cognitive space like it's
  not at that level of like deep awareness but then you have to ask like what what
  would that even look like if it was yeah so over time when you're like lifting weight
  why do you hit a because eventually you you're recruiting all of your motor units
  and then you just don't have enough muscle to produce the force so that's the that
  beginner spike in performance is you're not actually growing muscle mass in that
  period of time you're just learning how to actually like use all the muscles that
  you have and then you hit that plateau and it's like okay well now I'm using I'm
  firing 100% of my muscle abilities just my muscles aren't strong enough to actually
  move my body so and a lot of those sort of plateaus in performance can be sort of
  tied back to sort of physiological structures that change and like the time courses
  of of improvement happen that you know like growing more muscle takes time whereas
  learning how to fire motor units also takes time but not in the same way so a lot
  of dep there um that area that I was just so speaking of naming I never I've never
  been able to finish a leure before the end of class um that thing were just that
  little area is kind of often in the area we would call neuromechanics neuromechanics
  is a relatively new newly named field I would be curious to see if it's in that
  mesh uh terminology thing we learned about last time um but neuromechanics neural
  mechanics um is kind of like at that boundary of neural activity and like and like
  physics like mechanics um stuff uh so that thing of like firing a motor unit to
  create a spring force that moves the limb that's a neuromechanical question um and
  then like how that connects to like the spinal Central pattern generators you know
  that's where it starts to get like is that still neuromechanics is that you know
  these are murky areas um on the other side of neuromechanics you have biomechanics
  biomechanics is literally Newton's Laws as it applies to meat um and we will be
  talking about that uh to some level of specificity um the not too distant future
  um let's see yeah let me let me finish this up and we'll talk about that um yeah
  so biome mechanics is related to like just the physics of moving your body um we're
  particularly going to talk about descriptions of the body that are that basically
  remove any conception of biology from them and just thinking about the human as
  an object that weighs a lot and is balanced on a pretty narrow uh platform and that's
  sort of center of mass base of support level of uh description of the human body
  which we will talk about in some detail pretty soon um another thing I haven't mentioned
  but we will talk about to is evolution because all of these systems are evolved
  systems they all they developed over billions of years um to the form that they
  currently are and in the same sense of things you can describe the system as it
  stands right now but you're always going to be missing some of the story if you
  don't think about it in the context of how it emerged um and so I haven't quite
  figured out a lot of the things I'm talking about are the things that are going
  to go into these sort of numbered lectures once I sort of figure out how I want
  to chop things up um there's I'm going to be extracting a lot of things from what
  your conversations are to figure out how to steer that those lectures um there's
  some hit points that I'm going to hit no matter what you guys want to do um and
  evolution is going to be one of those things and specifically for us um it's going
  to I'm going to be well I guess talk a little about the evolution of your eye but
  um I think a lot of my particular interest is in the thing that is often yeah evolution
  of your your skeleton um like why our skeletons are the particular weird shape that
  they are how we sort of developed from our Origins as fish that turn into lizards
  that turn into squirrels that turn into monkeys that turn into Apes that turn into
  us um because it matters a lot um evolution of our eye is another odd story uh the
  our retina is backwards in some pretty interesting ways like it's not it's like
  flipped in the direction that you would expect it to be like you would expect that
  the light sensing aspects of it will be facing towards the light but they're actually
  backwards they face back and they kind of have to bounce through and this is thought
  to be related to like when we crawled out of the ocean and our eyes kind of inverted
  to allow the same kind of refraction to happen um yeah so uh we didn't talk in this
  particular story about eye movements eye movements we will talk about also in some
  detail um I we have we humans have very mobile eyes that's a very Cornerstone aspect
  of our visual system is that our eyes move a lot um it is part of the motor system
  to be able to move any part of your body including the eyes and that specific area
  is called ocul motor control oculo eye motor movement oculo motor is sort of stuff
  related to eye movements um and so things like ocul motor control is obviously very
  overlapping with things like visual perception and perceptual Neuroscience because
  as we move our eyes the information on the retina changes and we have to make and
  we make decisions about where to move our eyes in the same way we make decisions
  about where to move our our arms but this is also a place that like as like we you
  can live a whole happy life and like never really think about your eye movements
  but once you start thinking about your eye movements you'll realize that it's I
  think about it a lot like it's it feels a lot like breathing to me where usually
  your breathing is something that just happens on its own but you can control it
  to some EXT like I can hold my breath I can take a breath I can do that I have volitional
  control over my breathing in a way that I don't over my heart um and our eye movements
  are kind of like that as well like I can choose to look one place or another um
  I can choose not to look at something um but for the most part for 99.9% of my Waking
  Life my eyes are just kind of doing what they do um and being driven by a combination
  of a ailable visual information and my desires of the world and sometimes like if
  I throw something in the air I will look at it and then catch it and there's a lot
  of that process that is happening just below that level of conscious awareness um
  and that I think is a nice enough segue into we're going to talk about for the last
  10 minutes which is methods methodologies um methods is kind of a it's just just
  the term that we use for like how in God's name are you going to study any of this
  that's kind of what methods means and generally speaking when we talk about methods
  we're talking about um equipment and and ways that we can do empirical measurements
  of the world that will give us information about parts of the world that we think
  might we might be able to glean some insight into these deeper weirder aspects of
  the this is another great term desiderata of our investigation desiderata means
  that which is desired um and it is a sort of philosophy of science term about what
  are you trying to figure out you came into this room as a scientist because you
  have a certain there's something you want to know more about there's some part of
  the world that you want to gain insight into what is that thing and how how can
  you do it given all the limitations and straints and sort of difficulties of like
  how the world is um for me in for me in my sort of domain of inquiry um I I use
  two primary uh research tools map which is sort for motion capture um which is the
  thing if you see like behind the scenes stuff in movies and video games like the
  suit with the dots and stuff like that that's motion capture and that's basically
  related to um moving the body like sort of recording the movement of the body um
  in space and I will be at one of the lab sections I will be showing um I'll be bringing
  in some cameras and doing a freeo cap recording which is the open source software
  that I've been building um which is designed to like help um record the body with
  a high degree of fidelity um like this specific three-dimensional configuration
  of the body at any given moment in time because you know I would love to be able
  to study all the Bing activity of the pingi cells and the cerebellum but that's
  not available to me in this year of Our Lord 2025 um I can't actually get that measurement
  and the methods that I could use even if we if we if we could get that from something
  like fmri which is like the tube that you get the sort of colorful pictures of the
  brain um in this current moment in technology I can't use that type of a tool and
  also have a person out in the world throwing and catching and doing stuff like that
  um and so we use motion capture as a methodology to record the 3D configuration
  of the body over time then we use those movements to try to infer while if the if
  the arm did this and gravity is like that then the muscles must have done this or
  that in order to produce the forces that generated that movement and then you kind
  of backtrack from well if the mo if the muscles did this then the spine must have
  done that and sort of you can use this kind of like this observable aspect of reality
  which is like the location of the arm measure it to the level of fidelity that you
  can with the available technology that you have and then use those empirical measurements
  to try to infer all this weird goopy nonsense of what I've been talking about about
  this part of the brain that part of the brain that part of the brain um the other
  technology that I tend to use a lot is I can draw on this board ey tracking which
  everybody loves eye tracking um it's always a crowd favorite um but that's another
  sort of like there's different tools to use it but mostly these days we use video-
  based eye trackers which is literally just little cameras pointed at the eye and
  it's kind of a a convenient thing that we are as humans um have these highly mobile
  eyes um that sort of wind up giving this really interesting readout of what my brain
  wanted to get more information about at each moment in time so if you give me a
  task like walking over rough terrain or sort of juggling or throwing and catching
  or something like that um you can look at the movement of my eye and at the very
  least know the visual information that was available to me in that moment by doing
  sort of 3D modeling and sort of saying okay the eye moved this way and then this
  the object was over here and so you know you know based on what I know about the
  eye I couldn't see it then or I could see it in my periphery um and then I chose
  to make a movement that would align my eye so now it's in my phobia and so you can
  use just like a camera pointed at the eye to tell the information that was being
  transmitted into my visual cortex and sort of going down that way which both gives
  you the information that I had available and more importantly arguably the place
  that my eyes move to tells me the place that my central nervous system decided I
  want more information from this part of the world and because those eye movements
  tend to happen really really fast like you know 150 milliseconds per eye movement
  if you're doing a difficult task um like well below the level of conscious awareness
  we can tell stories about what we were doing after the fact but in the moment the
  eyes just kind of go where they need to go um and so I can tell both what information
  was available to this weird magical meat robot at any moment in time and I can also
  look at the decisions that were made of oh I'm going to move my eyes this way and
  not that way until where my central nervous system desired more information from
  in the world at any moment in time and so in the by the combination of these things
  of being able to measure the sort of the perceptual input in the form of eye tracking
  and the motor output in the form of motion capture um Wei this is my general attempt
  is to my my general approach to scientific research is to try to combine these two
  methodologies to give a sense of like get a picture of what's h of what a given
  of a what a human is doing in the world as they sort of perform complex actions
  and then use that weird pile of data that pours out of those machines to give some
  insight into this stuff often in my particular case in the sort of conversation
  of science um I I this domain this typ type of research tends to give ecologically
  valid like like realist like it's real data of real people doing real stuff but
  the Fidelity is just limited like there's only the the accuracy and precision of
  information that I can provide with these methods is just very very limited relative
  to someone who's in a lab pulling out individual neurons and sort of doing all the
  reductionist work that they can do to get really precise numbers so the so the the
  sociology of Sciences people like me doing the broad scoke type of research work
  with people who to the more careful reduction of stuff and ideally we kind of we
  both work together so that we can tell more complete stories and tell more satisfying
  cartoon stories of what's going on for humans to new generations of undergrads every
  every year or two okay get all that covered no more questions Neuroscience nailed
  it great cool well actually that's it as there any um any we do have like three
  more minutes does anyone have any questions or what's the word emotional outbursts
  uh exential crises uh things I wish you wish I'd said more about no one would say
  anything in this moment in class I appreciate oh you do like the phon thing about
  the yeah yeah opson opson is that's the term Ops i n reminded me of like yeah yeah
  it's the same I mean plants don't really have the motor aspect but yeah that's for
  the biochemistry people I think it's the opson is the part that has the more there's
  a lot of lot of depth there there's only it's it's like a class of chemical and
  so you can you can look at that okay um great thank you for showing up um keep an
  eye on the Discord server Discord server and canvas I'll make an announcement about
  the actual assignments going on um and uh yeah see you on m not an assignment to
  this what's that so no assign this Sunday no not this Sunday and then I guess Monday
  is a holiday so I'll see you in a week yeah someone here told me that which I was
  it you somebody told me someone told me that there was a holiday yeah thank you
  appreciate that I probably would have figured it out I didn't have either one of
  them yeah I think it was just those two yeah exactly H okay

  text: we're recording now um so to repeat that um the the proper assignment like
    the the proper proper like poster proposal assignment will be on uh like a one
    or two sentence right up on the topic area that you're going to want your poster
    to be on and a singular citation of a paper that kind of represents what that
    research what what what that like research in the area that you're going to be
    presenting on um um the standard assignment for 22.99 is that you're supposed
    to pick a singular paper for the whole semester and then your poster is going
    to be you presenting just that paper um I think we can go a little bit beyond
    that if that's all you want to do that's totally valid um but I think we can do
    a little bit more broad of a of an overview um and uh but to keep us kind of honest
    we're just I'm going to ask you to to pick a singular paper and then the the bot
    me mediated conversation will be sort of designed to help you do that so if you
    you know give it say here's the topic I want to study um here's a paper I'm thinking
    about here's the abstract um I'll prompt I'll make the bot prompted to kind of
    like ask you the kind of questions um that you know I would ask you if I have
    the time and energy to kind of sit down and talk about it um behind the curtain
    when they talk about this class uh the most of what they tell us to do is try
    to help you guys not pick a review article for your paper and to pick an actual
    proper like Empirical research article like because it's really it's like like
    if you just go search for papers on a given topic you're going to find review
    articles at the top of that list and it's not always super obvious whether you're
    looking at a review article or a book chaper or like an empirical study um so
    I can tell the bot to help you with that uh and it'll do things like asking you
    about the methodologies and topics and stuff like that so just kind of like helping
    you kind of like parse the very very dense language that an abstract or scientific
    papers typically written in um and so then there will be some like sort of like
    simple check boxy style of canvas assignment and then like a Discord server based
    conversation space there um and those will be ostensibly um do um next week so
    end of next week meaning 11:59 p.m. on Sunday before the following Monday and
    if you don't hit that deadline there will be dire consequences um not really but
    it's sort of we wanted to keep kind of in that General Cadence that the that we're
    all kind of like on the same path um and probably probably by the end of this
    next week is when the I will have

  text: implemented the stuff where the bot will be kind of like keeping track of
    a profile of your interests and trying to like help in the journey that you will
    take through this General field um but we'll see anytime I make a promise about
    the future just know internally I am screaming um great okay off up okay who cares
    um yes okay let's go ahead and get into it um I know what to do methods I realized
    I forgot um Mo cap tracking Etc okay I also forgot a piece of equipment that I
    intended to bring today uh so I will use this instead someone doesn't know how
    to great that works all righty okay so let us begin the lecture proper um so it's
    been nice for the first part of this class kind of seeing you guys talking about
    your interest in the server you know kind of talking to the bot about what you're
    into and what you want to study and things like that um and I I intentionally
    wanted to have that part happen first before I kind of talk about my own talk
    too much about my own particular sort of map of this space um because I I didn't
    want to uh I wanted to let you guys kind of like think about it for yourselves
    before I came up and did like the like the traditional Professor thing which is
    to tell you here's what this field is and here's what this means and here's what
    the here's what is on topic here's what is off topic um because I generally don't
    think that that's how we should think about intellectual inquiry um and the next
    chunk of time I'm going to give you an overview of this domain of human

  text: centered Neuroscience um that is mostly related to my own particular history
    my own research background my own the studies that I've done um and anytime that
    you you know by the time that you have sort of lived long enough to have Specialties
    and personal experiences and whatnot you will have sort of charted your own path
    and trajectory Into the Heart of some field or some domain um and for pretty much
    all of you you know for everyone that sort of chooses to follow a route kind of
    like that um you are going to have a sort of unique path like everybody's path
    is going to be different and everybody's sort of the the the topics that are relevant
    to everybody's interest will all will be will be different um so I don't want
    to present this stuff in the sense that in a sense of saying here is everything
    that matters here is everything that is relevant to this topic um I I really want
    to keep it kind of on that like relatively personalized Narrative of these are
    the topics that are the most important for me to be able to study human human
    perceptual motor Neuroscience in the ways that I specifically have learned how
    to do um and sort of talking about that in that Con in that context of like the
    the the component pieces of my particular specialty um and I think the beauty
    of using sort of AI mediated Tools in a classroom setting is that in a traditional
    class the professor kind of like lays out the curriculum lays out the structure
    lays out the topic area and then you are all kind of constrained to follow that
    structure um and that's largely for practical reasons like it's just it's just
    too hard and it requires too much human labor to like really mediate and like
    sort of navigate the particular um sort of variations of interest of people in
    a room even even a room that is labeled under a particular course title um but
    I think with the AI you know limited though it may be it will always do a do its
    damnedest to sort of make whatever your interests are relevant to the topics that
    I have mandated it should care about um so as I start going through this stuff
    uh just encouraging you to really learn to key in to like your own personal feelings
    of interest in your own personal feelings of like being drawn or snagged or moved
    by some topic or some domain um and you know if you want to follow the trajectories
    that I'm doing that's all well and good but even if you wanted to you wouldn't
    it wouldn't happen that way because that's not how the world Works um and so as
    I give this sort of lecture

  text: um my main request for you is to just not let your brain turn all the way
    off I'm going to be talking fast about a lot of sort of topics that are going
    to be relatively unfamiliar um for some of them they might be the first time you've
    heard about it for some of them you might have heard about it before uh the goal
    is not to have you understand everything that I'm saying the goal is to just expose
    you to it um so as I start sort of blah blah bling at you um don't get too hung
    up on whether or not you're following everything just kind of like remember the
    words as much as you can try to let just try to let it wash over you I promise
    you nonzero of it will be attaching um and then when we kind of open things back
    up uh you can start asking the bot asking your neighbors the questions about the
    parts that were the most interesting to you and the part that I have found the
    most gratifying about doing this type of a class is the Discovery every time empirically
    that when I give a lecture on a given topic and then I say to 40 students ask
    the bot about the parts you found most interesting typically what I see from that
    is 40 different conversations about 40 different topics and that's really a lot
    of fun um so with that said let us get get into it um unfortunately I I brought
    I intended to bring a um like a tablet so I could like draw like stuff with colors
    um and I brought the tablet but then when I looked for like the the pen part I
    found I just thrown like this like standard pencil into here which I can't even
    I can't even imagine what was going on when I did that so we're just doing we're
    going to do it old school with unfortunately just a singular color but that's
    okay um let's see move over here so was your fault how dare you okay I'll just
    I'll put it on your bill um um um okay so right so the topic of the course is
    neuroscience the the department is biology and most of you as biology majors and
    whatnot have internalized to some degree or another with validity that biology
    and Neuroscience are things are is is Rel is related to things like cells and
    neurons and wet lab microscope

  text: types of conversations and stuff like that super valid super good topics good
    things to look at um and all kind of part and parcel with a particular philosophical
    tradition that is so fundamental to the way that we do scientific research in
    2025 in Earth um that we often don't even think about it and that is the concept
    of reductionism that's not your way um so reductionism is just sort of a general
    philosophical approach to the study of the natural world um which tries to break
    things down into smaller and smaller pieces so that with you can sort of make
    more and more precise measurements and more more precise topics more more precise
    investigations but this kind of like sort of like implicit assumption that at
    some point there will be that by looking at the component pieces of the world
    you'll be able to get a sense of the istic view of how everything works um and
    there's a lot of validity to that approach but there's also obviously a lot of
    limitations to that um because if you're only looking at the small pieces in isolation
    you never going to see or you're going to have a hard time seeing what we call
    emergent properties which are things that only really come about when you look
    at the the combination of things at a larger scale than the kind of things you
    can put into a test tube and under a microscope um the classic example of emergence
    is traffic um so traffic is a property of cars on a road um but you can never
    understand traffic by looking at a singular car it's something that only really
    comes about when you're looking at the cars operating in their natural environment
    um and so you know the the counter to reductionism is what you might call more
    holism or something like that um but that tends to be the scale that my sort of
    research domain tends to operate in is I I tend not to be like I look at the research
    of the people who are doing the highly reduced sort of like electrophysiology
    studies where they put electrodes into the brains of various animals um fmri where
    they have people in a tube and they're looking at the magnetic resonance of their
    hemoglobin in their brain um but my particular domain of research tends to focus
    on humans behaving in natural environments doing um the kinds of stuff that we
    do in our sort of day-to-day lives so you know like throwing things in the air
    and catching them involves there's a motor behavior of putting Force into the
    marker an information gathering phase and then another motor command which if
    it lines up with the world works out if it doesn't I drop it um and large sort
    of trying to understand

  text: that behavioral process um in its natural context and then trying to use whatever
    the best measurements that I can come up with um of those behaviors and then trying
    to attach them to sort of the more low-level reductionist sort of um fields of
    inquiry so that we can have a sense of like you know how the things like cells
    and neurons can lead to complex behaviors like that so I think of it as kind of
    like it's almost like a robotics approach so it's I like to tell people that I
    studi the part of Neuroscience that overlaps with robotics um because robotics
    is another field that kind of like keeps you honest in the sense that it's you
    make things that move around in the real world so you can't really cut that many
    corners so the thing just stops working um and the difference is that the like
    robots we know how they work because we made them but we they can't do all the
    things we want humans we don't really know how they work but they can do pretty
    much anything so there's this kind of combination of those two sort of thinking
    about the human as like a magical meat robot and trying to study it and understand
    it from the that perspective um can lead to a lot of useful results um and the
    nice thing about that is kind of the abstraction away from the biology and from
    the the the knowledge that it is in fact under the hood cells and neurons and
    you know membrane potentials and things like that um and thinking about it more
    in the terms of the things that we can measure um which we will talk about shortly
    um so let's talk so speaking of the natural world let's sort of talk about something
    which you know is one of the ways to parse out that General topic which is what's
    called the perception Action Cycle um so let's start by drawing a brain I'm trying
    to draw it I'm draw yes let's do it like that um so here's how you draw a brain
    there you go um the sorry try and you'll figure it out okay so this is your brain
    this is a picture of your brain that's your temporal lobe this is your eye you're
    facing that way um and there's a lot of details that are not being covered here
    but this is the general shape so here you are that's your that's that's you and
    you existence

  text: in the world and let's see let's do this different way there you go that's
    you you're in the world and here here's your body here's your eye here's your
    mouth and then inside of there that's your brain not to scale and so as you are
    in the world you have a very limited awareness of of your given context and the
    everything that that you know comes in through your senses and well your senses
    in your memory so let's think about a particular moment in time where you're sitting
    here you have your eye and then you see out here there's a cat you like cats and
    so you so the image so light from the sun bounces off the cat and goes into your
    eye and we'll talk a lot about eyes we'll talk about the lens we'll talk about
    the retina we'll talk about the phobia we'll talk about the optic nerve um but
    the most the main thing is that their your eye is the place where environmental
    energy is first absorbed by your nervous system and this moment right here is
    a very special moment in your perceptual cycle which is the moment of transduction
    um which is the term for the moment when some form of environmental energy in
    this case light has gets transduced and converted into neural activity in this
    particular case in your this is your eye the light goes in it goes into your retina
    into your phobia which talk plenty about um there's a particular uh class of molecule
    called opsin opsins look roughly like this this like you know um what are they
    called carbons and hydrogens and then the hexagon and then the long the long uh
    sort of Wiggly tail um the people in Biochemistry this is probably familiar shapes
    except this is not drawn well and then you have a bunch of these opsins in your
    eye um and they're all there's there's basically three main ones and they're sort
    of they're all they they're tuned if you want to use that term to different

  text: wavelengths of light and they the nature of them is that when a photon of
    light hits them they absorb the energy of that Photon and then change shape and
    I think I actually did this backwards I think they start out with the Kink and
    then when they absorb the light they straighten out um but whatever happens this
    absorption of a photon changes the electrochemical properties of the molecule
    and it goes from being a neutral to a plus one or a minus one or whatever it is
    um but the point is that the the the light that is coming from the environment
    bouncing off the cat entering your eye changing the chemical layout of the opson
    um and happening in the trillions and billions of sort of instances that biology
    tends to operate in um this changes the polarity and the Electrical uh state of
    the rods and the cones in your retina which get sort of you know accumulated with
    ganglia and various sort of other stuff um and leads to a shift in the uh electrical
    potential in the in that section of your retina that then gets sent in as spikes
    down your optic nerves neurons are the things that Neuroscience is made of and
    mostly what neurons do is they Spike they send little electrical pulses and that's
    how they communicate that whatever that neuron has tuned to has has occurred um
    and for a for a for perception for vision it's this absorption of light into the
    opson and the and the shift in this polarity and then the change in that electrical
    state that leads to a change in the um what's the term uh the spike rate of of
    a given gangan cell as it is sending its axon down the optic nerve into your um
    optic the occipital lobe and the the visual cortex um and so we're going to talk
    more about this in more detail and more coherence um but the important thing here
    is that the light that has been absorbed by your eye that is then gets converted
    through this strange biochemical machine into a pattern of neural activity uh
    because the neural activity is caused by the light and because the light has been
    reflected off the object in question there is a general belief and assumption
    um that that the pattern of neural activity has somehow has some relationship
    with the object in the real world there's some statistical correlation there's
    some relationship and the pattern of neural activity

  text: somehow encodes information about the world that you're looking at um the
    nature of that relationship is tenuous and complex um and generally speaking extremely
    impoverished like the actual information we're getting in any mo One Moment In
    Time is far less than you think it would be it's a lot but the richness of your
    visual environment for example is very much an illusion based off of your brain's
    ability to sort of Cobble together a lot of noisy information to give you something
    that's sort of accurate enough to move through the world but often in almost exclusively
    designed sort of like after the fact um so that's your brain again um it's more
    like a ma brain but that's fine so your optic so the light comes into your eye
    gets absorbed by the retina which is on the back of your eye sends a pattern of
    neural activity down your optic nerve um passes through some subcortical areas
    and the thalamus and stuff like that which we'll talk not that much about that
    part but there is some stuff that happens here um and then projects down to the
    occipital lobe which is otherwise known as the visual cortex which is in the back
    of your brain um not super important to know where it is but it's just just kind
    of like one of those things like it's like Vision happens here for in the back
    for whatever reason um and so this is the place where the first kind of like the
    first pass of information about your visual environment sort of starts to get
    computed and it's mostly in the form of like edges and dark patches light patches
    you know and stuff like that and once you get from V1 which is primary visual
    cortex it goes through other stages of processing that lead to sort of more and
    more complex you know um structures to emerge so like you start with things like
    edges and then if you have enough edges you can get patches and if you get patches
    then you can get textures and if you get textures you can get objects and that
    sort of like each stage of visual processing Builds on the stage before um to
    sort of eventually lead to the ability to do things like object recognition of
    like oh that thing out there is a cat there's a there's a conversation we can
    have about like like the the parts of that process that go down this lobe which
    is your temporal lobe which is here um tends to be the sort of object space of

  text: part that we tend to care more about in this class is the part that goes up
    this direction um which tends to be more in tune of using that information to
    plan your movement out in the world um something that I haven't said I think yet
    but probably but is something that bear is repeating is obviously this is a cartoon
    this is a very abstracted simplified version of a story which if you wanted to
    tell the whole story you would have to tell a thousand thousand stories of a thousand
    thousand humans in their Labs recording data getting a bunch of numbers and then
    making up their own stories and the discussion sections of their own papers about
    what the different parts mean and then this kind of cartoonified story is the
    version that tends to make it into the textbooks that we T sort of communicate
    back to you and sort of try to make sense out of any of it but I think it's really
    important that we remember that this is not the real story this is the cartoon
    and the real story is something that we don't actually have access to there is
    no there's no level like of of class where I can just give you the book that says
    here is what the visual cortex is actually doing the best I could ever do is just
    to give you a record of all the empirical measurements that all the humans who
    have ever investigated this man to put together and then tell you the story that
    we have collectively decided is the best story that we can come up with for how
    we think this part of this lumpy pink thing inside of all of our skulls is operating
    um but yeah but that's not there is a gap an essential gap between epistemology
    which is our knowledge of things and metaphysics which is what actually exists
    uh and the two things never truly touch there is always going to be a difference
    between knowing something and what that thing actually is and in the history of
    science we have told many many many stories about what we think is going on in
    the world and in our bodies and in our goopy bits um and historically over time
    every single one of those stories on a long enough time scale is proven wrong
    in some sense everything we currently think think will eventually be proven wrong
    in some way or another um evidence for that being everything we've ever thought
    up until this point has been proven wrong in some way or another um so as you
    think there's something special about today that's going to keep happening um
    indefinitely until the sun burns out but the beauty of the scientific process
    in some sense is that we have this belief that even though everything has been
    wrong there is a sense that each success of idea is less wrong than the one before
    it and less

    um sometimes those improvements happen by completely throwing around throwing
    out philosophical sort of like base level beliefs about how certain things work
    um but yeah it's a continuous process we'll talk about it um yes so so here we
    are in this cycle you the light has bounced off the cat it's hit your eye it's
    been absorbed it's been transmitted back to your visual cortex um you have identified
    that it's a cat and you have a an inbuilt volition that says I like to touch cats
    great we support this for you so this is the parietal lobe don't worry about the
    parietal lobe it's it's great but you can worry about it if you want um but the
    important sort of okay so this back here is your visual cortex um this on the
    side here roughly speaking is your motor cortex and So eventually you start as
    you as you look in more and more pictures of the brain you will and you can look
    at this directly the the the wrinkles and stuff on the brain are not random they
    are conserved in the same sense that while every face that we have looks very
    different they generally have two eyes and a nose and a mouth and just in different
    kind of configurations the wrinkly stuff and the the crevices and bumps and stuff
    on her brain roughly the same like if you were to crack open all the brains in
    this room which I don't recommend um you would find a lot of Correspondence in
    where the the big um creases and stuff come in um and I am not at the level of
    that anatomy where I can name them off the top of my head um but I do recognize
    them in pictures and that's how you can kind of it's easy to tell when someone
    is drawing a brain artistically versus when they're looking at Anatomy because
    artists and whatnot often just say oh yeah it's a bunch of like pink wrinkles
    and then you just sort of it's like okay well that's not that's not actually how
    we do but anyways there's a big one right in the mirror called the central sulcus
    sulcus is like the crease part and on this side of that sulcus is the somato sensory
    cortex somat sensation is like basically touch like think that this type of sensation
    um and on that side is the motor cortex so the n sensory cortex and then the motor
    cortex

    huny LI when we talk about the motor cortex um but I kind of it's It's I enjoy
    this distinction and kind of like there's these two sides of the brain where on
    this side of the brain it's kind of like sensation and sort of the the perception
    of the world like visual aspects and this the sort of sensory aspects and then
    on this side of the brain is where we start getting to like motor actions and
    movements and kind of the outgoing parts of things um and as we sort of keep going
    forward you eventually get over here to the frontal loes um the frontal lobe is
    like the big lumpy part in the front that's the like the the the most human part
    of the brain all Maman brains are roughly the sort of same anatomically they're
    just very fun mirrored into different sort of shapes and sizes like you know rats
    have a much more pronounced Factory bulb for smell versus their visual cortex
    and the human brain has a has a lot of extra Anatomy on that frontal lobe area
    this is thought to be kind of where decision making comes from this is where sort
    of like language kind of lives and often in it's um referenced in uh like executive
    function so that the feeling of like deciding what you want to do this is also
    where like metacognition happens so if you're having thoughts about your thoughts
    like oh yeah I'm angry right now like that's a that's a frontal loby area and
    and just reiterating the point every time I point to a part of the brain and I
    say this is the part that does this thing a little part of me inside is screaming
    and dying because none of this is how any of it that like that's that's the cartoon
    that's not how the real world is set up it's much more complex than that it's
    much noisier than that but it's if I say this is where executive function happens
    and I point at the front of the brain and then this is where Vision happens and
    I point at the back of the brain that statement is more true than if I switch
    those two things around so just it's important to reiterate that even though I
    am telling you these simplified stories these sort of textbook level conversations
    about how the brain is this is the stuff that if we come back to this class in
    250 years we're going to be saying very very different things but we'll probably
    still say something like the vision happens in the back and the cognition happens
    in the front anyways um from this frontal lobe from the you get sort of the frontal
    area executive functions then you get your premotor area and somewhere around
    here is where volitions arise volition is sort of same route as voluntary it's
    like the things that you want to do so you see you see the the cat and you say
    I want to touch the cat here

    happen and so now you are in this state where here's your body here here's your
    hand there here's this cat there and here's this desire that I sure wish that
    my hand part was on this cat part um and this sort of and now there's a a gap
    between the way that the world is in your perception and the way the world that
    wish the way that you wish the world would be which is that your hand was sort
    of touching this object okay so those volitions kind of meld with uh the perceptual
    experience and from this sort of alchemy emerges something resembling a motor
    plan um we're going to I'm trying to stop myself from going to some of these details
    because I am going to have like like we're going to have a whole lecture about
    the eye we're going to have a whole lecture about the motor cortex we're going
    to talk about this in more detail I'm just giving the overview uh but um but yeah
    but this is where we would call something the first time we start seeing something
    resembling a motor plan there's a lot of times in the chats y'all have been having
    where you talk about things like muscle memory um which is the sort of muscle
    memory is kind of like the uh it's a term we like to use it's like a very standard
    human expression um but it's also one of the things that like it doesn't really
    exist in a physiological sense like your Mo your muscles don't have memory they're
    much simpler object which we will talk about muscles too um usually what you mean
    when you say muscle memory is motor plan um and as you sort of work on something
    more and more and you get more expertise more experience that's the that that
    what we tend to refer to as motor as muscle memory is really like the motor plans
    kind of becoming more robust and more sort of locked in um and typically where
    a lot of that kind of motor planning takes place is not necessarily in the motor
    cortex um but most of that starts happening in subcortical regions um so if you
    think about a picture of the brain and you think about the that pink wrinkly thing
    in your skull that's T tends to be what we think about that's your cortex that's
    the um neocortex it's the part where most of the processing happens um which we'll
    talk a little about what processing means in this context um but it is I like
    to I like to talk about this as like that is the it's like that's kind of like

    focus on the rose like the red thing with petals and that smells nice and we spend
    a lot of our time focusing on that part of the plant in for very good reason but
    if you really take a step back and look at it from a b botney point of view it's
    mostly Bush and just a little bit of row and I think that's it's kind of the same
    with the way our cortex works um the majority of our central nervous system is
    not in that cortex it's in the subcortical regions and among my favorite of those
    subcortical regions is the cerebellum which it look sort of sits at this looks
    kind of like this fist shaped thing that sits right below your cortex when you
    look up pictures of the brain online you'll see the big pink wrinkly thing you
    see this kind of more dense sort of like grayish looking thing underneath it um
    that's your cerebellum your cerebellum is a very complicated Beast um it contains
    about 3.5 times as many neurons as the rest of your central nervous system combined
    um and that number is sort of strangely conserved across different animals like
    all animals mammals particular just because I don't know about the other guys
    um we all have cortex we all have cerebellum we have very different brain to body
    ratios and different sort of proportions there but in General however big your
    brain is whatever animal you are your cerebellum is has three and a half times
    as many neurons as the rest of your cortex um which is one of those things like
    I I always sort of come back to that it's sort of like that just seems anytime
    you find a number in nature that's conserved across a bunch of different stases
    it's just kind of like that seems like an interesting thing I wish I knew more
    about it um so your cerebellum the part of the reason why has so many more like
    neurons by by count is that the neurons in associated with it are teensy teensy
    tiny they are you have granual cells and you have pingi cells um which I W I'm
    going to look up pictures this because ah uh Peri cells oh do I have internet
    here yeah yeah preni cells in your cerebellum are like one of the more beautiful
    parts of the nervous of your of your brain it's kind of you have the cell body

    right there um Ramon kahal who yeah um was part of the sort of group that came
    up with the staining mechanisms that allowed us to sort of start looking at neurons
    in their isolation that happened in roughly 1909 before that we didn't really
    know what neurons were and didn't know if they were just one big mass or if they
    were individualized pieces and there was like a big scientific and philosophical
    debate about are neur is is the brain all one big connected piece or did the like
    do the do the neurons touch or are they separated from each other and there was
    Ramon Cal who was arguing in the favor of the synapse Doctrine which said that
    there was a gap between them and then there I think it was GOI who was arguing
    in favor of their it's all touching whatever that was called and then um GOI came
    up with like a silver nitrate staining process that allowed them to make images
    like this of looking at cells and ironically by making that staining process prove
    the Cal side of that argument correct and that they tend not to touch and then
    they both got both Ramon Cal and GOI got they shared a Nobel Prize but apparently
    they had such bad blood between them that they both spent their entire speech
    bashing the other guy um so there you go there you got that um but yeah so your
    so your cerebellum is consists of preni cells and then granu cells which in comparison
    look more like this they're they're small and they don't have these super long
    fibers that sort of go very long distances they're much more localized they only
    connect to their immediate neighbors um and the majority of ner of of neurons
    in your nervous system are these granular cells that live in your cerebellum your
    cerebellum is a layered thing um like most parts of your brain it's got kind of
    like um like the layers tend to operate phog gentically so that on the outside
    is the newest stuff on the inside is the older stuff um sellum has that structure
    we may talk about it I'm not sure uh we'll see it's one of those things like if

    volitional desire to touch the cat combined with the knowledge that there's a
    cat in front of you and started creating a motor plan which sort of you know this
    is where the cartoon gets really cartoony because it's like there's a lot of controversy
    about like the different steps of this process but long story short something
    in the com combination of your motor cortex and your cerebellum which is your
    cerebellum is largely like a motor based thing like a movement it mostly deals
    with movement of your body um it's thought to be related to like tool use um so
    this this thing that we humans can do where we pick up an object and kind of pretty
    quickly learn the physics of it um and using it as a tool that has certain sort
    of characteristics is thought to be like a neoc thing the Neo is the new part
    it's on the outside it's complicated um but there's a level there's a hierarchical
    nature of your motor system where at the at the higher levels where the top is
    pretty much like the frontal lobe the the the plans are much more abstract so
    it's things like I'm thirsty um I want I wish I was drinking water right now uh
    and then in order for that high level volition to be turned into something that
    can actually sort of lead me to my goal there has to be this sort of like um pairing
    down of specificity from that very high level volition uh down to something which
    at some level is going to have to boil down to muscle fir rings to move my body
    through space and so as I say oh I wish I had water I see that there's water over
    there and somehow that volition is converted into motor commands that move my
    legs so now my body is in a place that I can move my arm I know how this thing
    works so I open the thing and I get to drink water um and so that process tends
    to go you know from the motor cortex then you got the cerebellum then your cerebellum
    sort of has connections to your brain stem I say connections but they're really
    kind of like they're wrapped around each other um so you have your brain stem
    your medulla oblongata your ponds um that's the part of your brain people talk
    about your Reptilian Brain that's that's that part that's the part that handles
    things like is my heart beating am I breathing is my temperature within a livable
    range that tends to be hanging out and controlled at your brain stem um and your
    brain stem is the start of your spinal cord which is another good

    um and so your spinal cord is a part of your central nervous system often times
    when we think about the spinal cord it's often kind of it's It's given a bad W
    and we tend even when we look at pictures of like if you Google pictures of the
    central nervous system you'll often see pictures that stop here and it's just
    sort of like you know cortico centrism sort of just focused on that that rose
    on the bush and then less to say about you the cerebellum often gets in the picture
    but we often like cut off where the spine is um but your spine is just as much
    a part of your nervous system as the rest of it and the specifically the way that
    we're going to Define central nervous system as opposed to peripheral nervous
    system is uh Loosely that the central nervous system is where processing happens
    um where processing is a very goopy term um that basically means like information
    is coming in being some sort of conversion is happening which we might call a
    computation if we wanted to use like a computer analogy um but it information
    comes in changes form in some way and then information goes out um and the and
    you're and the the spine is doing that kind of of processing um at various levels
    which we will also talk about let me see how we are on time okay on time um but
    it's in very find it kind of fascinating ways and there are some stories that
    we will talk about later in the semester of studies that we aren't allowed to
    do anymore um on cats where you can sever the spine like like cut the spine so
    it no longer connects to the upper part of the brain um and the cat can still
    do things like walk um because the spine is is housing the the gray matter that
    that does that handles things like Central pattern generation and reflex responses
    um or something like a central pattern generator is a thing that handles like
    the basic rhythmic motion of my legs and the thing that says oh well one foot
    is going to be in stance and the other one's going to be in swing and then they're
    going to sort of swap off um and a lot of that processing is handled in the spine
    itself um your spine goes down your spinal cord ends actually around here like
    right below your thoracic spine I know right

    is like that's where it does become more um extension Cordy like and you you start
    to lose the gray matter and you get the more just like the peripheral nerves that
    go out to your limbs um yeah the yeah so the peripheral so I also just want to
    just again make that point that that distinction between central nervous system
    and peripheral nervous system is the kind of thing that is often stated as like
    this is a hard delineation um but there's a lot of gray area there one of the
    most classic gray areas is the retina um the retina has a lot of neurons on the
    back of it and there's layers to it and it's often described like we think about
    the retina like the eye sort of like the classical sensory organ um but there's
    stuff happening on the back of the retina before anything even leaves on on that
    optic nerve pass to the brain that really could be considered to be computation
    um similarly your skin has a lot of connections in it that you know might be doing
    things that we might consider computation um that's why like when you get hurt
    if you like rub rub the thing it doesn't hurt as much because the ACT the activity
    of activating sensory organs around the damaged area suppresses the feeling coming
    from the damaged area and that is all happening at the level of your skin um so
    just again this this these these names and terms and whatnot this is not like
    nature is not design divided into pieces with departments and names that's a thing
    that we humans did to Nature so that we could have any hope of making any sense
    of it but anytime we put a name or a label or or a category into nature we're
    always going to be making concessions and sort of we're drawing lines around areas
    because it allows us to have better conversations about those things but there's
    always going to be gray areas and often times it's those gray areas or the cracks
    that the that tend to lead us to abandon certain thoughts and go towards others
    um okay so speaking of the peripheral nervous system um so where I wish had colors
    uh there you go okay this is your arm that's these are your bones and your bones
    are mostly what you are like if we're thinking about it in terms of like the space
    that you inhabit like the

    it's mostly bones um and then all the goop that's associated with that is sort
    of the details but the General cookie cutter shape of you as a as a creature is
    driven by these weird sticks and these weird sticks have weird things attached
    to them called muscles um and yeah and So eventually one of the things that happens
    when you thinking about the sort of like more holistic picture of the world and
    sort of the way that you live in it um is be if you're in a lab if you're if you're
    living this reductionist life where you're choosing a particular domain of inquiry
    um and you're you're sort of simplifying and cutting out any extraneous factors
    that get in your way to to sort of zoom in as far as you can on that particular
    thing um you get to remove all the parts of the question that you don't want to
    look at and so if you're a neuroscientist you might have you might take the mouse
    or the rat or the fruit fly or whoever you want to look at into the lab and then
    just like remove all the parts that you that aren't Neuroscience so that you can
    have a better picture of the neurons that you care about when you want to think
    about when you don't have that capacity and you want to think about things more
    generally um you don't have that um that luxury and so if you want to think about
    how humans move through the world um and even if you care mostly about the neural
    aspects of it even if you care mostly about the perceptual aspects of that you
    are sort of required by the nature of reality to consider things like bones and
    muscles even though those are not particularly neural objects um because when
    we move when when our all this weird neural FL flam is eventually going to have
    to transmit down into something that moves the body through the world and this
    is where we get to the kind of the robotics y conversation because um this is
    the part where the neural activity which has been originally transduced into this
    sensory experience of of vision um all of that sort of combination of things is
    eventually going to get boiled down here to something that sort of flips that
    coin around and now the neural activity is going to be converted into environmental
    energy in this case in the form of mechanical energy so it's going to squeeze
    my muscle and my arm is going to move that muscle my arm is going to be move and
    this is now has there's an there's literal like energy in this movement specifically
    in the form of kinetic energy or you know you know if I'm pulling on a spring
    or something like that might be mechanical energy

  text: like potential energy kinetic energy spring energy that's the stuff that we
    get from our muscles and so there's that's the whole perception action cycle is
    this conversion of environmental energy into perceptual neural activity down back
    into a motor action and so your muscles are weird objects um and a muscle is effectively
    a variable stiffness spring that's pretty much what a muscle is muscles only pull
    your muscle can only pull on things muscles cannot push if when I when it looks
    like I'm pushing it's because this muscle is pulling on the tip of that bone so
    that my arm goes that way and that that's called extension and then if I want
    to squeeze this one then I send a motor command down there it fires the motor
    tendon Union GGI body organs and it says Hey surrounding muscle tissue contract
    and so this what was originally a fairly Wiggly Soft Spring gets electrified and
    becomes a rather stiff spring and pulls this joint up and this one there's they're
    paired there's a flexion uh muscle group and then there's the extension muscle
    group and those two things operate in conjunction to to move this degree of freedom
    and that type of so yeah and so that so the motor plan that comes down from the
    motor cortex and sort of through the cerebellum if you're a fancy type of an animal
    like a human it goes through the corticos spinal tract which goes there is a sort
    of connection straight from your motor cortex down to your spine bypassing things
    like your cerebellum all animals have a cortical spinal tract but it's really
    um but not to equal degree um and that's one of the interesting distinctions in
    the animal kingdom is like this is a fun this is one of my favorite I actually
    use this question to test like AI models to see how it does at Neuroscience is
    asking about the cortical spinal tract and how it varies across the animal kingdom
    because that's one of the places where the questions get really subtle um and
    so I can look at how it does at that answer to see like I'm looking at like a
    local model I can run on my computer like the small ones I I can watch it get
    the subtle Parts wrong when I ask it that kind of a question so but a lot of stuff
    I've been talking about about how like motor cortex motor commands go through
    like the cerebellum and the brain stem and stuff like that that is true um but
    there is also this cortico spinal tract anytime you see one of those big words
    with an o in the middle just replace the o with a slash so cortico spinal is C

    all the subcortical regions um and it's what allows us to be to control our individual
    degrees of freedom of our body directly um as opposed to doing things in like
    it's more synergistic way which is way deeper than I want to talk about in this
    particular lecture cheing that clock it's killing me um so yeah so here I am I'm
    so close I'm so ready to almost touch this cat um and I my motor my motor plan
    which has come down from on high down this sort of hierarchical structure of our
    motor system has uh taken my awareness of the world and my own body so the vision
    gives me information about remote parts of the world things I can not touch things
    that are outside of mine here's a great word peripersonal space the per personal
    space is the area that I can touch with my hands um outside of that is a different
    part of the world that's kind of happening in the parietal Lo one of my favorite
    studies is this like they got a monkey Myck monkey and they trained it to grab
    things on a desk um and then they gave gave it a a temporary lesion so they just
    like squirt something into the part of the brain that handles that peripersonal
    perception so that that part of the brain kind of goes offline um and you get
    what's called cortical blindness so the monkey sort of loses its ability to to
    see things cartoon cartoon um in that per personal Zone then they took the monkeys
    and they train it to use a grabber arm like a little like like claw arm so it
    now its reach is now farther because it can use this arm and when they ask after
    they teach it how to use it and they sort of leion that per personal Zone the
    blind spot increases to include the region that could be reached with the Grabber
    in addition to the hand um so put that into your worldview and see how it fits
    um so anyways um here I am I see this cat and I have this awareness of my body
    a lot of this is sort of call kind of associate that with um proprioception um
    so like as my arm is out here it is uh putting force on my joints because of the
    weight of the arm and my body can encode and is aware of those forces and I can
    use that to kind of be aware of where my arm is I can also see my arm I also have
    a memory of lifting it up there's a lot of ways that we know where our bodies
    are um but I know that it's here and that if I can make this part move that way
    um then I'll have I will have achieved my my my deepest desire of touching this

    we choose to to to break down a complex movement across the available joints in
    the context of the world that's a a cerebellum thing again cartoons um but let's
    pretend like it's not and so I I relax what is it so I I relax the flexor I tighten
    the extensor and that puts a torque on this bone which moves my hand here and
    now I have the reward of cat Sensations under my hand and I have now achieved
    this this goal of mine um right and so now and now we have and that's that's the
    loop so that's one path through that perception action Loop because now that the
    information has gone in been processed been sort of whatever and now that I have
    moved my body I have now changed the state of the world like my body is in the
    world so now as I'm perceiving the situation as it stands I'm perceiving something
    different and now I'm going to go back through that Loop and so of you know you
    perceive you act and then you take in the information and you kind of like that
    Loop is tends to be where you live your whole life um and so yeah and so this
    is kind of the cartoon overview of of the story as it as it holds um I will name
    some of the uh the fields associated with the things that we talked about um yeah
    uh generally speaking when we talk about well talking about like the physiology
    of the eyeball tends to be kind of like optology I guess um uh but that's that's
    more like lens and pupil and like the the goopy Parts um once you're talking about
    like the the neural the neural activity aspect of it we tend to call that like
    visual like visual Neuroscience perceptual Neuroscience because we are such Vision
    heavy animals as humans often when you hear perceptual we tend to mean visual
    um but strictly speaking it's all like anything sensory is perceptual um when
    we start talking about the parts of the Neuroscience that are moving your body
    we tend to call that motor Neuroscience you will often hear people talk about
    perceptual motor Neuroscience which again perceptual motor is the same perceptual
    SL motor and it's kind of like it's this connection and this kind of like this
    reality that the two parts

  text: are um perception in action and perception in motor control they're sort of
    intimately linked um oh I should mention this too um in your peripheral nervous
    system you have peripheral neurons and your peripheral neurons come in two types
    there is perceptual and there's motor shockingly and that distinction is is defined
    by basically which direction the information is Flowing so a motor command goes
    out from your central nervous system towards your periphery carrying a motor command
    so this this is a a neuron that's connected to a you know motor unit in my muscle
    and if it gets sort of tapped by one of these higher level structures it's going
    to get spikes that are telling it to Fire and that will contract the muscle um
    once I touch the cat what was the object of my plans um there are the the the
    the the the neurons connected to like the sensory um organs in my hand start firing
    differently and they send information back down your sensory peripheral nerves
    peripheral sensory nerves yeah so in your periphery it is just it's out outward
    stuff is your motor neurons um inward stuff is your Sensory neurons and that's
    kind of the main distinction there um again uh just the word cartoons going on
    there yeah why are you aware what's that why you not like aware why are you not
    aware yeah this is one of I think the most troubling realities of being alive
    is that and this is also part of the the standard um existential crisis that classes
    like this tends to give to people so have fun with that um we have a very very
    thin awareness of what is going on under the hood in our bodies and we have we
    have some awareness we have some conscious experience of like I'm going to reach
    out and grab this thing I'm going to oh yeah this feels cool in my hand this feels
    hard in my hand um but the more you learn about neuroscience and the more you
    learn about what's going on in the Hood the more you realize that those sensory
    that like the cognitive like the the conscious personal experience of having a
    motor experience um is a really really thin layer on top of a lot of complexity
    that's going on and that is unfortunately just like the situation

  text: that we are in um remember one time I was in grad school and we were in like
    a a parking lot my friends and winter waiting to go on a hike or something like
    that and for some reason this really stuck with me but there was just like a puddle
    of like dirty water in the middle of the parking lot that had this like really
    beautiful like oil sheen on top of it and it was just like the sort of fractal
    iridescent colors just and by the nature of oil it's just like one molecule thick
    that is giving this really beautiful like vibrant colorful shape on top of just
    cold dark murky water and I think about that a lot when I think about the nervous
    system because it just feels like that is kind of our experience of living in
    a body is we have this experience that is sort of riding on top of this really
    deep and complex biological neural complex system and the that conscious Sheen
    is related to the depths of what's going on there but we don't really tend to
    have access to it like I can't feel my stomach deciding when it wants to squirt
    out more enzymes to digest my food and I can't tell the difference between you
    know parts of this thing happening and you know like it's just it's not really
    available to me there are once you start learning about the about the bits and
    pieces you can start kind of mapping on your your conscious experiences to the
    things that I'm going to be telling you is maybe happening under the hood um one
    of the ones that's coming to me right now for whatever reason is like it's kind
    of a thing that is known where when when when a person starts lifting weights
    for the first time if you've never been a weightlifting person there's a a thing
    that happens where you very quickly like you'll shoot up the amount of weight
    that you can lift in a very short amount of time because your body is learning
    how to fire all of your motor units at once and that's just the thing that in
    your general life you just tend not to do and you kind of have to learn how to
    do that like how to extend like maximal effort and that is something that's happening
    at the level of like recruitment of motor units and so if you then if you now
    go to the gym and you start having that experience you sort of feel oh yeah I'm
    getting super strong and it's just kind of like you can map that experience onto
    this thing I just said about how your motor units work but it's in but that mapping
    is in the this like weird cognitive space like it's not at that level of like
    deep awareness but then you have to ask like what what would that even look like
    if it was yeah so over time when you're like lifting weight why do you hit a because
    eventually you you're recruiting all of your motor units and then you just don't
    have enough muscle to produce the force so that's the that beginner spike in performance

    how to actually like use all the muscles that you have and then you hit that plateau
    and it's like okay well now I'm using I'm firing 100% of my muscle abilities just
    my muscles aren't strong enough to actually move my body so and a lot of those
    sort of plateaus in performance can be sort of tied back to sort of physiological
    structures that change and like the time courses of of improvement happen that
    you know like growing more muscle takes time whereas learning how to fire motor
    units also takes time but not in the same way so a lot of dep there um that area
    that I was just so speaking of naming I never I've never been able to finish a
    leure before the end of class um that thing were just that little area is kind
    of often in the area we would call neuromechanics neuromechanics is a relatively
    new newly named field I would be curious to see if it's in that mesh uh terminology
    thing we learned about last time um but neuromechanics neural mechanics um is
    kind of like at that boundary of neural activity and like and like physics like
    mechanics um stuff uh so that thing of like firing a motor unit to create a spring
    force that moves the limb that's a neuromechanical question um and then like how
    that connects to like the spinal Central pattern generators you know that's where
    it starts to get like is that still neuromechanics is that you know these are
    murky areas um on the other side of neuromechanics you have biomechanics biomechanics
    is literally Newton's Laws as it applies to meat um and we will be talking about
    that uh to some level of specificity um the not too distant future um let's see
    yeah let me let me finish this up and we'll talk about that um yeah so biome mechanics
    is related to like just the physics of moving your body um we're particularly
    going to talk about descriptions of the body that are that basically remove any
    conception of biology from them and just thinking about the human as an object
    that weighs a lot and is balanced on a pretty narrow uh platform and that's sort
    of center of mass base of support level of uh description of the human body which
    we will talk about in some detail pretty soon um another thing I haven't mentioned
    but we will talk about to is evolution because all of these systems are evolved
    systems they all they

    in the same sense of things you can describe the system as it stands right now
    but you're always going to be missing some of the story if you don't think about
    it in the context of how it emerged um and so I haven't quite figured out a lot
    of the things I'm talking about are the things that are going to go into these
    sort of numbered lectures once I sort of figure out how I want to chop things
    up um there's I'm going to be extracting a lot of things from what your conversations
    are to figure out how to steer that those lectures um there's some hit points
    that I'm going to hit no matter what you guys want to do um and evolution is going
    to be one of those things and specifically for us um it's going to I'm going to
    be well I guess talk a little about the evolution of your eye but um I think a
    lot of my particular interest is in the thing that is often yeah evolution of
    your your skeleton um like why our skeletons are the particular weird shape that
    they are how we sort of developed from our Origins as fish that turn into lizards
    that turn into squirrels that turn into monkeys that turn into Apes that turn
    into us um because it matters a lot um evolution of our eye is another odd story
    uh the our retina is backwards in some pretty interesting ways like it's not it's
    like flipped in the direction that you would expect it to be like you would expect
    that the light sensing aspects of it will be facing towards the light but they're
    actually backwards they face back and they kind of have to bounce through and
    this is thought to be related to like when we crawled out of the ocean and our
    eyes kind of inverted to allow the same kind of refraction to happen um yeah so
    uh we didn't talk in this particular story about eye movements eye movements we
    will talk about also in some detail um I we have we humans have very mobile eyes
    that's a very Cornerstone aspect of our visual system is that our eyes move a
    lot um it is part of the motor system to be able to move any part of your body
    including the eyes and that specific area is called ocul motor control oculo eye
    motor movement oculo motor is sort of stuff related to eye movements um and so
    things like ocul motor control is obviously very overlapping with things like
    visual perception and perceptual Neuroscience because as we move our eyes the
    information on the retina changes and we have to make and we make decisions about
    where to move our eyes in the same way we make decisions about where to move our
    our arms but this is also a place that

    about your eye movements but once you start thinking about your eye movements
    you'll realize that it's I think about it a lot like it's it feels a lot like
    breathing to me where usually your breathing is something that just happens on
    its own but you can control it to some EXT like I can hold my breath I can take
    a breath I can do that I have volitional control over my breathing in a way that
    I don't over my heart um and our eye movements are kind of like that as well like
    I can choose to look one place or another um I can choose not to look at something
    um but for the most part for 99.9% of my Waking Life my eyes are just kind of
    doing what they do um and being driven by a combination of a ailable visual information
    and my desires of the world and sometimes like if I throw something in the air
    I will look at it and then catch it and there's a lot of that process that is
    happening just below that level of conscious awareness um and that I think is
    a nice enough segue into we're going to talk about for the last 10 minutes which
    is methods methodologies um methods is kind of a it's just just the term that
    we use for like how in God's name are you going to study any of this that's kind
    of what methods means and generally speaking when we talk about methods we're
    talking about um equipment and and ways that we can do empirical measurements
    of the world that will give us information about parts of the world that we think
    might we might be able to glean some insight into these deeper weirder aspects
    of the this is another great term desiderata of our investigation desiderata means
    that which is desired um and it is a sort of philosophy of science term about
    what are you trying to figure out you came into this room as a scientist because
    you have a certain there's something you want to know more about there's some
    part of the world that you want to gain insight into what is that thing and how
    how can you do it given all the limitations and straints and sort of difficulties
    of like how the world is um for me in for me in my sort of domain of inquiry um
    I I use two primary uh research tools map which is sort for motion capture um
    which is the thing if you see like behind the scenes stuff in movies and video
    games like the suit with the dots and stuff like that that's motion capture and
    that's basically related to um moving the body like sort of recording the movement
    of the body um in space and I will

  text: be at one of the lab sections I will be showing um I'll be bringing in some
    cameras and doing a freeo cap recording which is the open source software that
    I've been building um which is designed to like help um record the body with a
    high degree of fidelity um like this specific three-dimensional configuration
    of the body at any given moment in time because you know I would love to be able
    to study all the Bing activity of the pingi cells and the cerebellum but that's
    not available to me in this year of Our Lord 2025 um I can't actually get that
    measurement and the methods that I could use even if we if we if we could get
    that from something like fmri which is like the tube that you get the sort of
    colorful pictures of the brain um in this current moment in technology I can't
    use that type of a tool and also have a person out in the world throwing and catching
    and doing stuff like that um and so we use motion capture as a methodology to
    record the 3D configuration of the body over time then we use those movements
    to try to infer while if the if the arm did this and gravity is like that then
    the muscles must have done this or that in order to produce the forces that generated
    that movement and then you kind of backtrack from well if the mo if the muscles
    did this then the spine must have done that and sort of you can use this kind
    of like this observable aspect of reality which is like the location of the arm
    measure it to the level of fidelity that you can with the available technology
    that you have and then use those empirical measurements to try to infer all this
    weird goopy nonsense of what I've been talking about about this part of the brain
    that part of the brain that part of the brain um the other technology that I tend
    to use a lot is I can draw on this board ey tracking which everybody loves eye
    tracking um it's always a crowd favorite um but that's another sort of like there's
    different tools to use it but mostly these days we use video- based eye trackers
    which is literally just little cameras pointed at the eye and it's kind of a a
    convenient thing that we are as humans um have these highly mobile eyes um that
    sort of wind up giving this really interesting readout of what my brain wanted
    to get more information about at each moment in time so if you give me a task
    like walking over rough terrain or sort of juggling or throwing and catching or
    something like that um you can look at the movement of my eye and at the very
    least know the visual information that was available to me in that moment by doing
    sort of 3D modeling and sort of saying okay the eye moved this way and then this
    the object was over here and so you know you know based on what I know about the
    eye I couldn't see it then or I could see it in my

  text: periphery um and then I chose to make a movement that would align my eye so
    now it's in my phobia and so you can use just like a camera pointed at the eye
    to tell the information that was being transmitted into my visual cortex and sort
    of going down that way which both gives you the information that I had available
    and more importantly arguably the place that my eyes move to tells me the place
    that my central nervous system decided I want more information from this part
    of the world and because those eye movements tend to happen really really fast
    like you know 150 milliseconds per eye movement if you're doing a difficult task
    um like well below the level of conscious awareness we can tell stories about
    what we were doing after the fact but in the moment the eyes just kind of go where
    they need to go um and so I can tell both what information was available to this
    weird magical meat robot at any moment in time and I can also look at the decisions
    that were made of oh I'm going to move my eyes this way and not that way until
    where my central nervous system desired more information from in the world at
    any moment in time and so in the by the combination of these things of being able
    to measure the sort of the perceptual input in the form of eye tracking and the
    motor output in the form of motion capture um Wei this is my general attempt is
    to my my general approach to scientific research is to try to combine these two
    methodologies to give a sense of like get a picture of what's h of what a given
    of a what a human is doing in the world as they sort of perform complex actions
    and then use that weird pile of data that pours out of those machines to give
    some insight into this stuff often in my particular case in the sort of conversation
    of science um I I this domain this typ type of research tends to give ecologically
    valid like like realist like it's real data of real people doing real stuff but
    the Fidelity is just limited like there's only the the accuracy and precision
    of information that I can provide with these methods is just very very limited
    relative to someone who's in a lab pulling out individual neurons and sort of
    doing all the reductionist work that they can do to get really precise numbers
    so the so the the sociology of Sciences people like me doing the broad scoke type
    of research work with people who to the more careful reduction of stuff and ideally
    we kind of we both work together so that we can tell more complete stories and
    tell more satisfying cartoon stories of what's going on for humans to new generations
    of undergrads every every year or two okay get all that covered no more questions
