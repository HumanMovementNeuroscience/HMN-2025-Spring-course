full_transcript: okay all right what hello everybody sorry for the slow start um trying
  to get some stuff downloaded I should have downloaded at home um yeah so standard
  check in so we are officially in week number six uh which is a Fine Place to be
  um so we've covered a lot of stuff uh I would say we've covered the majority of
  like the the I guess like the bi the hardcore biomechanics stuff like to I've almost
  said like the motor control stuff but I probably will get back to it um but we're
  going to take a little bit of time this week uh talking about just like we're g
  like today we're going to go through some examples of papers like direct like published
  papers something that i' really like so of have some experience sort of going through
  a published article and sort of try to make sense of that um and then on Wednesday
  we'll do kind of like the like a sort of a small group kind of assignment to help
  you all prepare for the sort of exam like assignment SL poster proposal too that
  we'll be do probably they'll both be kind of like connected to each other and be
  du at the end of that's this week um right next week um so yeah that's I got these
  wrong I'll fix that later um the so basically the idea is like you know at this
  point I've talked about some of the kind of the topic area stuff usually in the
  riew and then we spend a good amount of time recording some data in class and kind
  of just like eyeballing it like looking through it and sort of trying to figure
  out what kind of stories could be told there we came in with some sort of basic
  hypotheses and things like that um and so uh what I want the kind of this sort of
  Next twoe Period to be which you know next Monday is a holiday so it'll be next
  three classes is to prepare yall to kind of start thinking about your own chosen
  topic whatever that happens to have been um using the kind of like thought processes
  and mental Frameworks and stuff like that that I've been talking about in the context
  of human body human movement research uh based off of kinematic motion capture data
  um so what that's going to look like is you know sort of figuring out what the topic
  area you've chosen is um you've already done that to some extent um but sort of
  just you know digging into that a little bit more and then starting to think about
  uh the methodologies that are used to pursue your your topic of interest um I know
  that sort of the way that we gathered that it was sort of a combination of talking
  about topics and also picking a paper and the paper part is the sort of technically
  the most relevant part to the poster proposal but I want to make sure that that's
  couched in the context of like there's a reason why I like this paper and this because
  I'm interested in this topic um so trying to trying to sort of flesh out like the
  methodologies involved in your area of research um the kind of like and like the
  empirical sort of grounding of it like in the sense of so what are the methodologies
  used what are the tools that are used to collect the relevant data for whatever
  the topic may be um and then how does that kind of map on to the kind of conversations
  we've been having around cameras and motion capture and sort of you know what is
  the what is the sort of the core empirical tool involved what does it measure what
  are the sort of what are the units that get derived from that and what are the you
  know what are the the the data types and structures that the um that the sort of
  scientific insights in your area of focus are sort of build on top of um and that
  will kind of culminate into a sort of like a follow-up proposal like proposal proposal
  number two which will be uh sort of like a fleshed out version of the original sort
  of of like here's a paper I care about thing um so been thinking about like how
  what kind of mechanism I want to use for that sort of thing um and I think what
  it will wind up being is a a a a base level assignment that will live on canvas
  and in the GitHub repo uh that will involve you copy pasting some text uh from your
  own kind of like the profile thing that you have been generating and pasting that
  into a set of chats from the bot that will be sort of prompted in in the server
  um that will be sort of the idea will be like you'll you'll go in there you you'll
  start with whatever your last um whatever the the most relevant blob of text you
  have about what your interest are and what the paper is that you in the topic You'
  chosen take that into a chat space and then the bot in that space will be prompted
  to ask you about a certain sort of layer of the I've been talking about um and then
  at the end of that you'll ask it for a summary possibly using a prompt that I'll
  provide and then take that and put it into another chat and then have another sort
  of layer of conversation um and then the output of sort of those set of conversations
  will be something resembling the poster proposal to that will sort of be the fleshed
  out version of what you're looking at um and the reason for the structure is like
  I thought about trying to make just like like one chat like we've been doing that
  sort of does all the stuff but that starts getting really difficult and that starts
  getting into the space that these types of AI sort of as implemented here just can't
  really do like they're not really like it's like if you give it a set of instructions
  it's not really good at like two-part instructions like do this and then do that
  like it's just not set up for that you can set up the code on the back end to handle
  some of the stuff automatically but it's much much easier to just like make two
  versions of the prompt and then just give you the intelligent humans instructions
  that say do this and then do that um and the idea will be kind of like you know
  you'll be setting yourself up for the next conversation and that will also give
  you some sort of experience but like directed prompting and that kind of like aiish
  training thing um and like the the the conversations and prompts that I set up for
  you will be kind of built out of the lectures that I've been giving Which on the
  YouTube playlist which is linked in the server um so I'll be like you know doing
  something I've been doing might may not be obvious to you like of uh pulling the
  transcripts from those lectures and kind of pulling out the main points and sort
  of using that to help drive the conversation um and so that's why it will sort of
  I'm counting that sort of set of chats as like an exam like object where you will
  have a set of things to do um and if you don't do those things you'll get a bad
  gr and it will be somehow culminative and based off of stuff that has happened before
  which I think is like the legal definition of a test um and then that will kind
  of set you up for The Proposal Part which is another requirement of the structure
  of the classes to make sure that by this week um pushing it um you're set up to
  actually hypothetically start working on the actual poster with the kind of fleshed
  out nature that that needs to be um so I will it's the the lecture pulling stuff
  is the reason why I'm not ready to give you anything today but I have all that stuff
  it's kind of like uploading like the videos they they take a long time to upload
  so I have to wait for the last one to get up there because I only put it up this
  morning um but I'll have something kind of put together and started for that by
  next Wednesday um so that way we can sort of talk about it in class you can ask
  questions things like that um and then you know leading in that be sort of uh hypothetically
  Doe by the end of week seven which is next week and so now I'm going to give a little
  bit of time talking about the the posters themselves and sort of I'll put some templates
  into the um into the server and I I'll get those in the relevant place on campus
  soon um but before I do that before you look to closly uh there any questions so
  far any sort of like concerns stress levels things that if you knew you would feel
  more comfortable about your status here someone sent me an email asking about the
  poster like structure itself for that's what we're going to talk about today um
  yeah great okay okay so the poster itself these are just some examples that I found
  um from previous courses taught uh which is made more difficult because I don't
  have PowerPoint on this computer um but that's okay okay we that one um so this
  is a PowerPoint slide uh it is you know PowerPoint or Google Slides I think it's
  the equivalent or keynote on Mac is the equivalent of that um I'm sure a lot of
  you has PowerPoint slides in it um but it's long story short the nice thing about
  something like a PowerPoint is that is a vector-based art thing um meaning that
  these visuals are defined not by sort of pixels on an image like a lot like most
  images like if you zoom in on them they start you could start to see the pixels
  um uh Vector base Graphics are not like that they are because they're defined mathematically
  like this curve here is not defined as a set of dots it's defined as like a mathematical
  definition of how to draw this shape and everything on the PowerPoint page is that
  way so the advantage there is that you can zoom it up infinitely and you'll never
  see the pixels because it is not based on pixels um the opposite of vector base
  is raster based um and that's most images where if like you take a screenshot and
  zoom in it start you can only zoom in to the level of the resolution of the image
  um so most posters are made with a vector-based visualization method um PowerPoint
  is I would say like the entry level version of that PowerPoint are an equivalent
  of PowerPoint um and for the vast majority of you I would say almost all of you
  except for someone who has like a really specific interest in like design um I would
  just say use use PowerPoint use Google whatever it is use whatever just make basically
  a single page a single slide that has information about your poster there if you're
  feeling fancy and want to do the prograde version of this um the professional version
  of a vector graphics editor is called Adobe Adobe Illustrator is like the main one
  um you all have free access to the Adobe Creative s Suite through your Northeastern
  email email um you don't know how to do that just ask someone that's not me um how
  to get access no yeah just yeah you just kind of you just download and log in right
  you just download Creative Cloud and just log in with your north eastern account
  no you have to uh you have to go to a a specific website and then go to and submit
  a request for a license okay well that's too bad but it takes like a day or so a
  day or two yeah so if you're into that you can do it um there's also um inkscape
  is a free version of Adobe Illustrator um which I've used it I sort of in the way
  that these things tend to go like the free version has kind of been in development
  for a long time when I was in grad school it wasn't very good and wouldn't be what
  I would consider like like an like a viable alternative um but I've used it recently
  and it's gotten pretty good I think for basic usage it might be helpful but it but
  realistically don't expect it to sort of be at the same level as illustrator but
  also realistically if you're new to that space you're not going to be using the
  pro tool to the pro level so you can give it a shot um and whatever you choose I
  would say like the stuff that we'll be doing to prepare like the content of the
  poster will be independent of the poster itself so if you want to try a fancy thing
  and then sort of be like I don't want to do this um you can convert later uh okay
  so what should actually go on the poster itself um the basically a poster is like
  a distillation of a paper that's kind of I think the best way to think about it
  at the level that we're doing in this class um that's not all that a poster has
  to be um it could be other things um but the default sort of purpose of a poster
  is to kind of give you a representation of a particular study typically that you
  typically i' say almost exclusively that you yourself are doing um so that you can
  take it to something like a conference and then put it up and then have then stand
  next to it and hope people come by and talk to you about it um I showed you some
  pictures of like scientific conference poster sessions you can just you know sort
  of uh that's the that is the the structure that's being sort of mimicked here um
  so and at the end of the semester that roughly speaking where they go uh the week
  of April 7th there will be a poster session for all the inquiries classes and you'll
  be assigned one of the days and that will be your day to present um and you'll present
  your poster along with half of the students in each other class and then if you're
  not presenting then your assignment will be to go around and partake in the posters
  um including you know a certain number of posters from this class and a certain
  number of posters from the other classes so you can kind of like get the experience
  of what that sort of process looks like and feels like um yeah so yeah so like I
  said I said before and we'll say again um there there's kind of there's the default
  version of the assignment and then there's kind of the whatever else you want to
  do part of the assignment um so I'm mostly going to be talking about the default
  assignment which is just pick a paper and present that paper as if you were you
  know a person I don't I don't know if they like what the other class say in terms
  of like should be like role playing like a grass in the lab or should you I think
  that gets kind of weird just or you can just be like my paper they blah blah blah
  just talk about it in the third person um but yeah but you also have the option
  of like you know if you want to add more citations there if you want to talk about
  other things um I think if you want to use any of the data that we use in this class
  as part of your poster um we can sort of set that up basically like any of the data
  that you've seen before now before April 7th I'll have I'll make that into a place
  where you can like pull screenshots and sort of just like talk about it um if you
  wanted to have the experience of using like actual data that you've been a part
  of as part of your presentation that's a viable option um yeah so in terms of yeah
  so in terms of like how do you put the poster together together how do you you know
  from a given paper or topic area how do you actually create a poster uh that's where
  there is sort of like instructions about that um which I think might on this one
  there are some instructions from other classes that I'll I'll pull up that are sort
  of more written setup but um the basic idea is that you're not what you're not supposed
  to do is put all the information in the poster all the information in the paper
  on the poster um you don't want to have what we call affectionately um a wall of
  text poster we all know what it feels like to be confronted with a big wall of text
  it's not fun um and it doesn't really it's not helpful to you as a as a person coming
  in um something that I think really needs to be driven home over and over and over
  again is that science the scientific process is primarily a process of communication
  if you're sitting alone in your lab collecting data and running running numbers
  and stuff like that and you never actually show it to anybody else you're not actually
  doing science you're just kind of like you're doing an investigation you're playing
  around with data but the process of science is is a process of communication so
  when you're present in this sort of interface of a poster or a paper um is the traditional
  method for communicating science to other people uh presenting a poster in a conference
  kind of you know I I say unofficially counts as a peer- review type of session but
  you can't say this is a peer reviewed poster um but you are getting it reviewed
  by your peers um in the sense that you know people other people who know the area
  are going to look at what you've done and hypothetically have the option of saying
  oh hey you made a mistake here there or the other um which is a Cornerstone of how
  we do sort of science you know I'm sort of I'm talking about a system that I'm pretty
  uh jaded about so I'll talk about it kind of in the idealized form um so so yeah
  so so when you are translating whatever poster you're doing whatever topic you're
  doing whatever project you're doing into poster form it your job is to kind of do
  the distillation like it's you're the you're the person hypothetically who understands
  the project better than anyone else like argue like if it's your research project
  you probably understand the nitty-gritty of it better than anybody else in the world
  and the people that you're going to be communicating with are only going to be talking
  to you for like a couple of minutes like you know 5 10 minutes at most you know
  not at most but um a very short amount of time like if you look at you know the
  picture of like sfn or something like that there's thousands and thousands of posters
  and if you're a person you're not going to see all of them you're going to go to
  a particular area but you're not going to be spending hours and hours on each poster
  you're going to be kind of coming up and saying hey what's what's the deal here
  and your job as the presenter is to be able to give them the deal like tell them
  what was what the study was and what what happened at a level where if they just
  sat there quietly and listen to you then you could get sort of from start to finish
  let's say within 3 to 5 minutes um and the person listening knows enough of what's
  going on that they can walk away and say oh yeah that poster they did this thing
  they found this result they you know they will if you've done a good job they will
  walk away with a certain sort of gut level takeaway um that they can that they will
  then be able to explain what your study was about without having to know all the
  details itself um so there's a certain strategy on what you put on a poster uh where
  you want to make sure that you are like the takeaways that that person walks away
  with should be the takeaways that you want them to walk away with like there's a
  lot of things in a given research study um and you can present the same study in
  five different ways and sort of have the person walk away with five different hopefully
  not like in hopefully not like incon herent inconsistent beliefs but you know you
  can focus on you know one thing or another and you want to make sure that you're
  packaging it in a way that will they will be able to understand that will stick
  and that they will be able to walk away and when they say hey that study over there
  was was about this person doing this thing and finding this result that they're
  saying roughly speaking what you believe about that thing um now I said if that's
  what would happen if the person just stands there politely and doesn't say anything
  which sometimes is what happens and typically it's not uh the um it's not it's not
  necessarily an insult especially at conferences that people are tired and they want
  to get the the the gist but um in general in Academia and the Sciences if somebody
  starts criticizing your work a lot and then just starts pulling it to pieces and
  picking up the threads it's that's a compliment like they care enough about what
  you're doing to think about it and ask questions and it could be really offputting
  to people especially students who are used to fatigue being like to give you a a
  rank order in your grade um but if I'm asking a lot of questions it's because I
  want to know more and I'm I'm using my time and my energy and my attention to do
  the thing that I was train to do as a scientist who is peer reviewing other other
  research which is to look for problems look for mistakes um not necessarily to like
  not necessarily like to Target the mistakes but just because I want to understand
  what's going on and I want to make sure that it was done right because we're trying
  to sort of create new knowledge here um so that's where the second part of the strategy
  comes in where if you're presenting the poster you're never please do not just read
  it to the person that's not fun for anybody um but you're going to present it in
  a high level way and then so that when the person asks questions ideally you have
  the answer to that question right there W waiting so even though you might be just
  zipping through this and sort of like moving past this stuff because it's your study
  there's a certain like the first time you present something you might be surprised
  by the questions that you get but after the first couple of conversations you realize
  that 90% of the questions that you get are predictable in some way and so you should
  just have those questions sort of answerable from the data that's on the paper so
  you know this type of stuff is a good example where I wouldn't want to be talking
  about um oh yeah we did this study with this mouse Maze and there was the water
  was this deep and the thing was this big I don't want to be describing the size
  of the whole of the of the apparatus but if the person asks how deep it was I should
  have an answer for it and actually they wouldn't even have to ask that question
  they can just look at the picture and get that themselves um similarly with a lot
  of like the the method like often times that's where you put like details that you
  know you wouldn't necessarily say you could say oh yeah we have this rat do this
  thing and this maze but the details are there so the person can just kind of skim
  them and kind of know the answer there um and yeah and I will say I think that the
  you know there should be some kind of a methods section uh which should have some
  visual representation of like what you actually did what the study actually was
  like you know this is a good example because it's like I know by looking at this
  that you looked at mice in a water bucket with a camera you know you could just
  as easily have you know if you skip this type of thing oh yeah you have this with
  a camera and I know that there were three conditions and one of them was a sham
  meaning they didn't give it do anything one is injured and one is whatever this
  condition is and so now I have a sense of like what it is that you actually did
  it's really easy when you know something too well to skip the parts I call it skipping
  Step Zero it's like the things the immediate questions that anybody coming into
  would ask are the first things that you forget to explain when you get into it so
  it's like you know you can have this if you're just showing the result blah blah
  blah blah blah I could be like halfway into my conversation but then my person asked
  wait are these mice are they rats are they fruit flies are are they on a treadmill
  are these celegans you know they start asking questions that make it clear it's
  like oh they don't even know like basic thing that I did which is stand in a room
  with m in a water bat um so the method section should always have something that
  just makes it clear what that is in my preference that will typically be figure
  one in whatever paper you're looking at this isn't always the case but I I think
  this is true for papers as well like figure one or something very close to figure
  one should be some kind of a picture that makes it clear what you're actually doing
  and the results over here um should be some representation of the data that was
  recorded uh typically there's going to be I guess yeah you want there to be some
  nice Harmony here um and this is also typically where you are it's your job to kind
  of choose the most important data um for a lot of papers and certainly for a lot
  of studies you're produce a lot of data um and a lot of visualizations showing various
  things related to the data that you recorded um like whatever paper you choose like
  it could have you know five six 10 or more um figures of data in it but your job
  is to understand what's the main figure what's the main result you know and if I
  if if I can only show one or two results from this paper what should those results
  be and those should be the results that back up the conclusions and then keep your
  directions if that's appropriate um of the study itself so I you know introduction
  is typically it's kind of like the you know here's why we did this this is where
  you can have citations if you want them like we did this because it's related to
  this other study that did this other thing we did this because there is this group
  of papers that sort of suggested this effect is true and so we did this study to
  test if that effect is true um breaking it out into research question hypothesis
  is fine not everything has this stuff so delineate if it's fine uh some kind of
  method saying here's what we did some kind of a data data representation of like
  here's the main results and some kind of a conclusion because of all the stuff that
  we did we believe that some fact of the world is the case um some new proposed fact
  of the world is the case like I this this is ifate the part where you say the things
  that you now believe because of the research that you did and you hope that after
  going through this little journey people that you're talking to the people who are
  reading the paper um will also believe you they'll say yeah the things that you're
  describing seem supported they seem reasonable I will go along with you on this
  you know and then if enough people are convinced by the story that you've told it
  becomes a quote unquote scientific fact which is always something to be wary of
  because we're always wrong about everything and and every scientific fact will be
  proven wrong in the fullness of time um so but we do our best in the moment um one
  so the so generally speaking uh by generally speaking I'll say you will pretty much
  never read a poster to a person like if it's your poster don't read it to the person
  have some other way of talking about it but the idea is that if the person had the
  poster given to them and they read it from start to finish they would know roughly
  speaking the story that you're trying to tell um and so in the poster itself for
  the actual presentation is kind of there as like an it's sort of an aid for you
  um explaining what you're doing so you have so you you don't you can remember what
  they're talking about you have things you can point to you have data you can point
  to um but yeah sort of a yeah it's kind of the process there I should also say this
  is another sort of classic uh way of presenting data where these a points up here
  are what you would call Representative data and then this here is some measure of
  the like the statistics of that data so representative data is basically like you
  can choose like you the researcher because you are a trustworthy person who's not
  lying and has ear methods appropriately documented you are allowed to look at the
  big body of data that you have and pick a particular recording that is representative
  of the of what you're trying to show um so you might record um so yeah so in this
  case they put mice in a water bucket and then they had to learn where platform was
  so they can sort of get out of the water um and our case we were doing stuff like
  you know the jumping task or you know the standing task and so for the standing
  so imagine for the standing task we recorded 25 different uh participants and you
  know and each of them did 10 different repetitions of beta that's that 200 some
  of Trials whatever um you can go in and kind of pick one trial or even one section
  of one trial that exemplifies the effect that you're trying to show um and then
  just click about that one little part sort of clean up and then past it there and
  say this is representing a data from a subject in the partip stud um but that's
  not really that's an without additional support that is anecdotal that is you just
  sort of picking one from a set of a thousand options and saying this is the one
  that looks like the story that I'm trying to tell that's not that that's not really
  evidence on itself so you want to have you want to be able to back that up by having
  some kind of a measure of Statistics that is looking at all 1,000 trials that you
  did and sort of appropriately comparing you know subjects to subjects and conditions
  to conditions and da da da um so that this is where you actually start having statistical
  power and statistically supported statements and this is these are the data that
  kind of like this is where like the real grounding and sort of knowledge generation
  comes from um but it's good to kind of pair both because you know the representative
  subject data helps the kind of understand what you're talking about um or the statistical
  data helps them understand that this is a thing that happens in general um that's
  always going to be different based on the studies and stuff that you're that you're
  doing um you want to see posters um generally if you just walk around a department
  in the school you'll see posters on the wall um people put their favorite posters
  on the walls outside their lab uh and so you can just walk around and take a look
  at what they would look like and sort of just get a sense of the sort of the styles
  that are available and sort of the choices that are made and you'll see some with
  a ton of words on them you'll see some with very few words on them um and I recommend
  just doing that just go whatever hours the day you want through whatever you know
  wherever the various Departments of the school are and you'll you'll typically find
  posters on the wall that you can sort of look at um in our case the sizes can be
  very different I've gone to conferences where the posters are like 6ot by 4ot so
  very very large I've gone to some conferences where they're like 3T X 3T which is
  very small um I can't actually remember I I want to say that our posters are 24
  by 36 Ines um which is like this big but I can't recall I'll I'll look that up that's
  that's a relevant thing to have but mostly that will just affect the font size that
  you use um this is again with the vector scale stuff like the actual scale shouldn't
  matter too much um yeah so but it does depend like you know you want to make sure
  that the font size is not oppressive [Music] um yeah also just Google scientific
  poster you'll find a lot of examples uh is the kind of thing that there will be
  many many layers of explication and tutorials about how to make a good this and
  how to do a good that and that will all be relevant here um with the exception that
  you won't be writing paper yourself a lot of this stuff is just going to be sort
  of copy pasting from the paper itself just you know get the figure put it up and
  um then these sort of the section down here in the bottom right will be where you
  put your citations that will be generated from Soo or whatever else uh yeah yeah
  so we'll we'll go through this and then on a particular day of yeah so yeah so the
  the poster needs to be uploaded by Tuesday March 25th uh which means that you'll
  upload a PDF and then it'll get printed um they charge you for it I want to say
  like 20 something bucks I can't remember exactly I'll get that number too um but
  that's due at the end where 25th is oh that's due on the Monday so two weeks before
  the actual poster session which is mostly um because as you can imagine the the
  printer office gets for this course hundreds I guess of posters so we want to make
  sure to give them enough lead time that they can get it all pretty in case anything
  goes wrong um and there'll be instructions on how to do that and you know all that
  good stuff yeah and this I will um so I'm going to drop these into the Discord server
  before I put them on canvas just so it's available I please load up any questions
  or confusions s okay yeah so like I just do my poster on one paper I just do that
  on paper is there any otheres not really no um like by the the base level assignment
  that so so they had a couple yeah um that was S I say again was that they only reference
  it in int I'm actually I was looking for that uh cuz I actually can't see see where
  these citations actually happen in the poster uh I guess this that might be something
  I can't remember so I would actually say they may have this may have just been like
  incorrectly done because you're supposed to site stuff here but this again for this
  assignment it's a little bit weird um so I'd say like the default assumption is
  that there's you know the base level assignment is that there's only going to be
  one citation here and it's the citation of the actual p paper um where you got the
  things um I would still say you should site it somewhere in the like in either in
  the introduction or in the conclusions and say you know this and that study did
  this you know you this one either have the one or CH at all 2018 just had that cited
  somewhere in the text um and yeah so in default assumption is that's just the one
  paper uh it's also the kind of case I think as you go into your paper there might
  be some other obvious choices to site like you know you know future directions could
  you like oh there are some follow-up studies that were done after this was post
  to be cited there um in in their introduction they might say we're doing this because
  of this other paper and then you can just site that one too um if you wind up you
  know they're using some weird method that you don't understand and then you go find
  the review article that says here's how that method works and how it's used if you
  use that as part of your development of the poster that's a good thing that you
  would want to just have some citations somewhere and then just put it down there
  um you know citations in this context are often used as kind of like you know it's
  a rubric it's like it's like oh you have to have this many in order for it to be
  a valid thing um but that's obviously nonsense that's not how we use it in in the
  real world when you're you just you site stuff that you have used to say to understand
  all the work in this poster that I'm presenting and this research that I'm presenting
  you have to also go back and sort of like I am doing I I am building this study
  and this knowledge on the basis of the stuff that I have you know read before like
  I'm I'm building this on other people's work and if I'm doing that I need to cite
  it because you know for if you're trying to figure out if you should trust this
  resource that I'm presenting you I need to tell you that the stuff I'm presenting
  depends on work that has come before me and this is that work so hypothetically
  if you really really didn't trust somebody when they're presenting their data to
  you you can go back and look at all the things that they're depending on and this
  is where you get into this Con there's like a concept of like citation networks
  and stuff like that where you know any study that has a certain am number of citations
  you can Bounce from that study to other studies and sort of navigate all the empirical
  work that has been done in the world for you know at least since whatever 1800s
  when sure of keeping track of this stuff um so so yeah so but for the for the strict
  assignment it's just one thing and in general when it comes to posters the citation
  thing is a little it's it's it's much squishier like like posters are generally
  speaking kind of an informal type of presentation um not always some conferences
  are are pretty serious about them but I think for the convers that are serious about
  their poster sessions the posters are always paired with a paper so you write a
  six-page paper or whatever Accord that to go along with a poster and the poster
  itself is you sort of often just sort of like you print it for the conference and
  then you just use it to discuss at the conference and then it's not going to go
  into some like you know the anals of some scientific Society or something like that
  so they're generally just sort of treat it as a much more informal type of thing
  and then the actual like the actual proper like review process is done at the level
  of Articles and papers make sense yeah anything else any other questions thoughts
  feelings cool all right yeah yeah we'll we'll I'll be sure to plan some time somewhere
  probably somewhere in this sort of two week chunk oh yeah do at the beginning of
  this week so I'll plan there'll be something in this chunk to kind of like practice
  your poster now I'll try to do it the week before it goes because it's often like
  you put you put the poster together and then you start explaining you're like oh
  this is not at all what I want so I will do some sort of we can do some kind of
  demo run probably in this week um so that you'll have a you have a chance to kind
  of go through it with your peers before you're doing it in person um it is also
  just absolutely standard experience that when you're presenting a poster for the
  first time the first couple people that you present it to get the worst version
  of the story and generally speaking speaking by the end of the session which you
  know for a lot of conferences can be like you know 3 4 hours rather long time um
  you have by by the end of that poster session you have the story of your research
  so down like so perfectly down that it's like if you ever find yourself going to
  a conference and presenting a poster I beg of you to do yourself the favor of taking
  notes voice notes text notes whatever you can about what you've been talking about
  in your poster like the moment the poster session is done because the story that
  you're trying to tell will never be clearer in your mind than it will be after you
  have pulled it you know however many dozens of times you do um and that's another
  like within the context of like how science operates and sort of a practical communal
  sense that is often the purpose of a poster session um not always the case but generally
  the case posters and also talks like most of the times when you're when you're presenting
  stuff at a conference it's stuff that you're working on it's not stuff that's you
  you typically I mean it sort of depends on the cycle but you I think if if you're
  really using the conference to its fullest extent you should be presenting stuff
  that's not quite done yet it's not ready for prime time it's not published it's
  not peer-reviewed it's the paper that you're currently writing not the one that
  you just published um because this poster session the poster session in particular
  is a really great opportunity to like hone the story that you're telling um and
  when you know and ask questions someone you know say oh yeah we use this method
  I'm kind of I'm new to this and someone's going to come by and like oh I actually
  know that method quite well and then you can ask them that question when it comes
  up um you know you might have a certain way of saying it that like the first couple
  times you do it people don't really get it and then you figure out some turn of
  phrase that makes everyone go oh right now I see what's going on and that's the
  way that you want to describe it like you know when you're describing the methods
  like you know you'll you'll often this is this is absolutely the most classic student
  behavior that ever exists you'll describe it in way too much detail um and then
  eventually you'll learn all the details that you can leave out that help people
  understand what it is with with the minimum amount of time and then that's the way
  you should learn how to talk about the stuff that you're doing they're very classic
  especially for grass students like The Birth down grass students start presenting
  uh research they will um they will spend the amount the amount of time they spend
  discussing a particular area is proportional to the amount of time that they spent
  working on that area and that's almost never what you should do like it's possible
  that whoever these people are spent a good four to five months trying to figure
  out how to make the water in the stupid thing stopped leaking out and they kept
  using there some thing that wasn't working and they figured out the glue and then
  blah blah blah blah blah and like that's and then when they actually got it working
  the data just kind of fell out of it and so when they give the presentation they're
  going to spend the first half of the conversation talking about all the glue that
  they had to use and how the the leak you know how they sort of got the the water
  up to the right level and da da da da da that stuff shouldn't even be a part of
  the conversation you just that part off sometimes when I'm giving a presentation
  I'll just say in this slide transition was 6 months of my life and then I just show
  the result where it worked and not the 15 iterations of failed attempts that I had
  to do before I got the version that works um if the things that you were doing to
  make it work are interesting you might want to record them in another place but
  a poster is almost never that time um and then that might be the case where someone
  comes along go how'd you get your stupid thing to fill up because ours keeps leaking
  that's when you can say oh yeah we use this glue and not the other glue and that's
  the place where like at the end of the paper that you wind up publishing on it you
  can have the very long methods where you can have a little section about why you
  have to use this glue and not the other glue and da da da da um yeah so it's the
  process of kind of distillation that I think is really the nut of this assignment
  um and it is your job as the sort of the ambassador of This research study to to
  to make the call to make the Judgment call about what what's the most important
  part and what's the narrative that we're going to try to pursue here okay yeah right
  we good cool um yeah and we will have plenty more opportunity to talk about this
  stuff in your specific case but um cool all right now with all of that said let
  us just let's go and look at at a paper and let's see so we have approximately 40
  minutes left and I am going to attempt to do to look at two separate papers which
  is a terrible idea because I've already done the thing of saying this is going to
  have an and in the lecture um and I love the papers I'm talking about and I'm going
  to want to dive deeply into them um but I think it's fun to do the the quick run
  through so we'll do that and I'll try to keep myself to a particular time um I will
  also finish up a thought I meant to have like half an hour ago wishes uh after we
  do this sort of aside around the the papers and the assignment and the exam like
  object um we're going to transition into Vision stuff um like eyeballs and I'll
  bring in an eye tracker and we sort of like talk more about visual Neuroscience
  I record semit tracking data of like go through it to the similar to how we did
  before um it's going to be a bit of a different vibe there just because the nature
  of the equipment and the data but um we're going to do Vision stuff um which yeah
  is always fun uh yeah vision and specifically eye movements um which are technically
  a part of motor control because it involves muscles but sort of a interesting space
  there okay so in 20 minutes or less which will put us at 410 uh I'm going to look
  up so C prot cpg is one of those things I forgot for that m um storing volary there
  we go 2012 this used to be a new study now it's old that's not that old it's just
  over a decade at this point so I just for so this is a paper published in science
  which is one of the bigger journals out there there sort of there's two journals
  which are sort of like categorically the biggest journals biggest and most prestigious
  science and nature um that sort of cultural reality of there being a biggest thing
  is generally toxic and leads to a lot of bad outcomes but nonetheless uh if you
  see something published in science or nature that's a good study good and prestigious
  study um generally speaking the more generic the name of the journal is the more
  prestigious it is so the Portuguese study of ankle Prosthetics research is generally
  going to be lower Prestige than you know Journal of Prosthetics which is going to
  be lower prestige in Journal of biology which is going to which so science and nature
  are about as big as you can get in that space Also cell is a very good one for biology
  [Music] um and because we are on campus I could just download this here um but just
  for fun we're going to go to scub uh and punch it in there and add that way uh I'm
  using this dark reader thing so turn that off so it looks like it would normally
  look okay and I have 15 some OD minutes to go through this I probably won get to
  a second we'll see okay so this is kind of normal um the when you download the PDF
  the front page is just kind of like info about the thing um title arti artist author
  list Journal at all means there's more of them um and there's links here to things
  like supporting material supporting online material other things that site this
  article sites um with modern papers typically there's going to be supplemental data
  or supplemental data supplemental methods and stuff like that um modern contemporary
  Journal articles are tend to have very very constrained lengths um so the core studies
  are typically going to be quite short um unless it's like a Journal Review or like
  an older you know that all varies very much by um by Journal um so to kind of get
  around that they'll often have these like supplemental stuff so like either something
  like the methods will not be a part of the word count and or um you have the opportunity
  to present additional data there um and yeah so so what I'm going to do now with
  this study because I know this study quite well uh I'm going to try to give you
  something like a very high level overview of this paper that ideally will both be
  fast enough that I can do it in the next 15 minutes um comprehensible enough that
  you'll be able to follow the story despite not being sort of particularly trained
  in this area um and ideally a sort of fair and honest representation of what was
  actually being done so that if you were to take the time so sort of read this paper
  in depth and sort of get through all the nitty-gritty you would come out of it saying
  oh yeah everything that John said about this is an accurate representation like
  I'm creating the cartoon Narrative of the study so that I can present it to you
  in a way that will sort of handle itself and if you became an expert on this area
  and on this paper ideally you would be able to evaluate my choices of cartoon ification
  and understand why I choosing this form of the cartoon and not some other form of
  the cartoon this so so yeah so this is a study about the spinal cord and particular
  it's looking at spinal cord injury and trying to get at something like a what has
  been a sort of Holy Grail type of thing for quite some time which is the ability
  to heal spinal cord injuries like you you know you get an injur you get an accident
  your spinal cord is damaged and you lose control of your limbs below that area may
  you might lose control of your legs you might lose control of your whole body depending
  on where that injury occurs and we really really would like it if we could correct
  that in some way um which yeah the same way that we can correct it when you break
  your ankle or you know damage some muscle damage some skin we would love to be able
  to correct that on a person um yeah so this here is the abstract of the paper um
  again different journals will sort of format this in different ways this one's not
  even labeling it as the abstract they kind of assume that you know that um but sometimes
  it might be called a summary sometimes it might be called something else um I know
  noticed that on yeah so on the actual website they're giving a sort of a high level
  summary in addition to the abstract um but yeah all the information should rly speaking
  be there um so this study Builds on so this study so the the application is for
  uh is in the space of trying to sort of heal spinal cord injury um but this study
  is not looking at patient populations they're not looking at people who have spinal
  cord injuries um they are looking specifically at rats um and this is where like
  if you look at any so these numbers here are the citations and if you scroll to
  the the end of the paper uh they will correspond to the actual citations there um
  these are in science format um sometimes you'll see citations where it's like author
  year so it's like you know Mathis edel 2019 or something like that that's APA format
  this is a more engineering style literally just because it's it's made to be shorter
  um and see if you look at these citations they will be referencing clinical studies
  and medical studies and things like that um but they are not themselves doing research
  on humans this is a this is an application with a basic science sort of motivation
  where they're trying to have a theoretical they're trying to increase theoretical
  understanding but they're doing it in service of being able to move towards this
  applied goal um and they are building on a history of studies of um studying Central
  pattern gener spinal Central pattern generators in mammals um those Central pattern
  generators exist in pretty much all animals not not necessarily all animals but
  many many animals um and they they generally refer to neural architectures that
  generate rhythmic Activation so it's some sort of like a metronome type of activ
  of activity uh which is the basis of a lot of motor behavior and just um General
  life so let's see so so this is a really fun animation of a ant walking alternating
  tripod gate so the red or one tripod blue or another tripod that's how insects operate
  and that's a rhythmic Behavior breathing is a rhythmic Behavior most forms of locomotion
  ayic Behavior flapping is a rhythmic Behavior it's the kind of thing that is present
  down to invertebrates like insects and also present up to mammals like us and um
  spinal cpg cat uh and this particular study is following a particular sort of branch
  of um of ways of studying that idea of central pendon where specifically as they
  exist in the spines of invertebrates um because it's kind of this like there's a
  general question around like we know that cpgs are present in lower animals we can
  study them very carefully in those animals um because they're simpler and you know
  we can sort of open them up and sort of see these things happening um but then the
  question kind of arises like what is the role of these types of neural architectures
  in more complex animals like mammals who have many many many more neurons and have
  many many many or mag more complex behaviors um but still have the same sort of
  evolutionary history um so this is a a a video which is quite old and kind of from
  an era sort of a different era of like animal rights I'll say um so this shows a
  cat that has been uh decerebrated um so it's hard to see but this is this is the
  cat and it's being supported by these liars and this cat has had its spine SED here
  so from so let's see how you drop so that's the brain and then that's the cerebellum
  and that's their spine and then these are the legs and I think for this era they
  would sever the spine there so they they surgically cut the spinal cord so that
  there is no information going from the legs to the brain and no information going
  from the brain to the legs um and so the legs are still connected to the spinal
  cord here um and then kind of the interesting result here is that if the cat is
  supported and walking on a treadmill the hind limbs are still walking they're still
  doing the rhythmic behavior of locomotion being driven by the sensory motor Loops
  from the feet up through the spine and sort of back so this is kind of counter to
  a lot of our intuitions about how the Spine Works um which we tend to think of it
  as like a there yeah um you have to think of this just kind of like extension cables
  that sort of lead from like the brain down to the dumb muscles um but this type
  of stuff shows that there is processing happening in there like your spinal cord
  is a part of your central nervous system and it can handle simple stuff like the
  sensory information coming off of the feet um is enough to generate the behavior
  that leavs the feet to sort of like if I'm being pushed backwards at a certain point
  I should lift up go forward and come down again and the two limbs are sort of reciprocally
  activated by Central pattern generators in the spine and so that not only can the
  cat walk um despite having no cerebral implant to their spine to the back legs as
  the as the treadmill speeds up they speed up with it um which is just sort of chew
  on that you seem perturbed it just feels wrong yeah yeah yeah yeah uh it's it's
  it's a wild result just to be clear and it absolutely is baffling in many layers
  and levels um but and probably is when I like to study so much um and it's kind
  of like you know as is often the case um it's those parts of the empirical investigation
  where you go oh wait that's not what I was expecting we're often the best investigations
  live um because despite how strange that is uh I'm giving up on the second paper
  we're going to focus on this one um for the rest of the class uh we'll talk about
  the next one the next one about dragon flies we'll talk about that once we've done
  more Vision stuff about vision and dragon flies we'll get there um so so yeah so
  the um so despite that being a sort of strange and baffling study um um it has it's
  also venerable like it's it's been around for a while we've known about this for
  a while that there are these Central pattern generators that govern movement and
  they handle like things like the basic trade-offs between you know the limbs going
  from stance to swing and stuff like that um and so there's been active areas of
  research since then trying to understand the nature of these spinal cpgs and trying
  to understand like you know where they how they operate and sort of what the connection
  is between the brain and the and the like the upper level of the brain and the lower
  level of the spine and sort of into the peripheral nerves and stuff like that um
  and those Studies have evolved uh there was some point in time I'm not really sure
  the exact history here uh where you know the animal rights rules kind of evolved
  uh and at some point they were like don't use cats for that anymore um the rules
  about animal ethics are interesting and complicated I'll talk about them at some
  point um but there are kind of like rules about like which animal you're allowed
  to use for which study and there are some kind of like strange designations for
  like higher higher level versus lower level and typically speaking the closer you
  get to a humanlike animal the the the more stringent the standards are so like we
  do still use non human primates for Neuroscience research we don't use apes and
  chimpanzees um but if you want to do monkey research you have to really really justify
  that you that you're doing research that needs to be done that it needs to be done
  on a non-human primate um and so at some point they you know they decided that you
  can't do it on cats anymore so now they do similar stuff with rats so this study
  was done with rats um and this also by the way has a really fun Ted talk about it
  um where Greg Lut is very very like smarmy French type of thing which is is a really
  good presentation um if you can get past the kind of like the Ted Talk of it all
  um but it's a good job of like telling an interesting story um although yeah the
  way he tells his story is actually not the way I tell my story because that's another
  sort of point to to call out here I am telling you this story as I have internalized
  it like I me as a particular individual human scientist with a particular background
  and sort of like area of the world that I'm trying to make sense of when I tell
  you the story about this paper it's going to be different than if the the authors
  of the study told you this paper or if somebody with a different background and
  interest set were tell you the story of this paper um there's this sort of context
  of like narrative that keeps coming up um that feels sort of like unexpected in
  a sort of discussion of like scientific empirical studies but remember this is all
  stuff being done by humans and we only remember stories that make sense to us um
  and so I'm going to tell the story I'm going to tell you sort of highlights a particular
  area of this that I think is sort of I found motivating um since I gave myself a
  little bit more time also talk a little bit more structurally about this paper uh
  so these are all authors of the paper they all contributed in some way um the the
  person at the front is the first author typically speaking this is like the owner
  of this the person who like did the work and sort of own the project generally speaking
  um this is going to be like a grad student or a post do or something like that the
  last author is the often times the senior author um so generally speaking not always
  the case um and this does this is somewhat Fu dependent but in most like biology
  related neuroscience types of of of studies the last author is the person who runs
  the lab where the study was done and the first author is the person in the lab that
  generally did that work um again it's very it's very that's all very very it varies
  dramatically by paper and by field and by whatnot um but if you're like in grad
  school or a postd something like that like you they you will be considering your
  first author Publications differently from your non-ir author Publications the people
  in the middle are people typically people that like helped out in some way um but
  they were not like the owner of the study um yeah then once you get to not once
  you start publishing papers and start looking doing things that involve paper publishing
  um people will ask you questions about how many first author Publications do you
  have versus second author Publications typically you'll have more second author
  pubs than first author pubs and then once you get to the point where you actually
  are running lab people will start asking questions about how many last author Publications
  you have meaning are you training people to do this work appropriately um again
  that's very field dependent um math people when they publish math papers they publish
  their authors alphabetically which is wild to me um but what I'm describing here
  is like sort of like standard cultural practice in contemporary scientific publishing
  um down here you got all these little citations showing what these numbers correspond
  to so like where they're working most of the work with done in Switzerland U and
  it's also going to tag um oh here's a tag that says okay so these two have a star
  that says these authors contributed equally to this work which is something it's
  a way that people try to get around the the first authoress of it but I guarantee
  you there was a discussion about despite them being starred who actually gets to
  be first and then this one is also important uh this is the corresponding author
  so this little symbol here says that if you want to ask a question about this paper
  you should contact this guy so that's typically going to be in there um and also
  I will go to the end just because again from a structural perspective um there's
  always going to be something like an acknowledgement somewhere in the paper and
  they're going to they'll do like thanks you know thank you for this person for helping
  with the robotic interface and da da d da um but they will also generally not not
  generally always should um site their funding sources so where did the money come
  from like in in this case they're listing a bunch of Grants from uh European research
  councils and d d this is an expensive St there a bunch of Grants but it's sort of
  a you know there's always going to be something saying thanks to the NIH for giving
  me this grant or whatever um and typically uh this is another place where like you
  say hey thanks for giving me this Grant and you tell you say this is this is you
  know Grant number is this so you can for public grants which most of these are you
  can go on you can go look up the grant that was written to fund This research and
  sort of see what they were talking about there so it's just kind of another way
  that people kind of keep connected to the larger uh Community when they're publishing
  particular papers um yeah modern papers also tend to talk they have a like a of
  like very like more recent than 2012 you'll it's more common to see uh sections
  that say that list out what each author did so like this person helped collect the
  data this person wrote the thing and there'll be a a paragraph or two saying what
  each author actually did when they were like how do they earn their spot on the
  on the author list okay so this particular study um this is your figure one figure
  one this style of figure is very common in like science and nature um journals because
  science and nature journals are very very short and very very dense this is also
  specifically um a report um which is you know generally speaking the journal will
  have like oh we have articles which are full length and like report which is short
  length and you know brief communication which is some other length and it's just
  so this is a report which is like this the T it's not the longest format it's the
  second it's like a a shorter form and this whole this whole study is five pages
  including uh the this front page so it's only four written pages of text and then
  probably if you go to those supplemental documents it's going to be when you go
  to the supplemental stuff it's typically going to look like a Microsoft Word document
  converted to PDF and it's going to be dozens to possibly more um Pages um but this
  study yeah so this picture with very dense with like letter um sort of sub panels
  um in particular with this kind of like professional looking animation sort of or
  visualization here very indicative of this type of Journal um if you go to sort
  of more like standard bread and butter types of journals like anything that's like
  Journal of like biomechanics Journal of blank um the the the the figures will generally
  look more like a real regular human made them rather than like a professional Graphics
  design team which in this case is what happens um so yeah and then um when I'm looking
  at a new paper uh I will look at the title I'll look at roughly speaking who wrote
  it like not the PE see if I recognize any names and kind of just look at where they're
  working um I'll read the abstract um and then I'll kind of skim the paper and look
  you know start out by just looking at the figures I typically like and by typically
  I will pretty much never just like sit down with a new paper and just read it from
  start to finish like it's a novel like that's just not how we tend to interrogate
  scientific papers usually it's it's kind of like jpeg compression like you do a
  you do skims at different levels and you kind of because you want to have the full
  picture and then you can sort of like choose to to sort of to Zone in um to different
  levels of analysis to different sort of parts of the paper um and science is a no
  clickbait situation so if we're if we're writing a good paper the title is a summary
  the abstract is a summary and then the paper itself will have sort of repetitive
  summaries within it um so so yeah so we're going to look at this this so this is
  figure one which will be referenced in the article somewhere yeah here so figure
  oh that's S1 so S1 is supplemental figure um but yeah so if you this even they're
  even they're citing figures which are not in the main article they're in this only
  you have to go to the supplemental information to get the get the results there
  um but this is the first one I'm seeing Figure 1 C represents this figure and the
  letter corresponds to this section here the figure will always have a caption the
  caption will always have a sort of one sentence summary of like what we're looking
  at here and then each lettered subsection will have some little write up of what's
  going on in that section um so yeah um yeah so this one is kind of doing uh like
  I said I think generally figure one should always be a methods figure and that you
  should also always or ideally have representative data this is doing both this is
  both a methods paper methods figure and a representation of Representative data
  okay so what were they actually doing here um so looking at stal Central pattern
  generators in mammals they're looking at it in rats specifically or they're using
  a rat as their model organism they don't they don't actually care about rats that
  much they're but they're using rats as a proxy animal that we believe has sufficient
  complexity that if we learn something about how supping Works in a rat that will
  be helpful in getting uh a treatment into humans and I happen to know that if you
  look at what this guy's been up to recently they have been able to apply this stuff
  in humans and I think they are actually like getting to the point of I don't know
  about like fully healing but I think they are restoring voluntary control of locomotion
  after a paralyzed spinal cord injury so I I haven't checked in on him in a couple
  like two or three years I guess so um but he's like he's like one of these like
  Mega people like they if you go to sfn he has like several rows that's just like
  a bunch of people that work in his lab because he just you know he's like the it's
  like a like a business owner type of thing so it's a very very different vibe if
  you have like a lab with 150 people in it versus if you have a lab like mine which
  has like three people in it so uh I don't want to run a lab like that that sounds
  terrible um so the idea was so they they they they took the M the rats and they
  yeah um so they took the the rats and they they gave them a surgical spinal cord
  injury they they went to in there and they they they gave them an injury that damaged
  their spine and severed all the fibers going to their brain so this is a picture
  of the central nervous system of a rat these are the two loads of the brain and
  then this is I'm not going to draw it uh but this is the spinal cord itself and
  the idea here this is kind of like the clever part is so this is the spine they
  didn't just cut straight across um they did two cuts one like 60% of the way through
  up here and then a little bit below it they cut it again going down there so all
  of the fibers that are going through here get severed but they're not just chopping
  it out so there is still a sort of a path hypothetically to go through so if it
  was possible for these fibers to kind of regrow and reform and reconnect to each
  other then you could theoretically have a signal coming from here and sort of like
  bypassing these injury points and getting back up to the brain um and so the idea
  was that they so this is and this is the process of sort of the decerebration part
  that's sort of similar to what they did in the Cat video um and literally it just
  you know they went in there and did surgery on these rats and went in with a little
  scalpel and cut them in certain areas and I'm sure if you go yeah adult threat received
  a left lateral over hem section at thoracic T vertebrae t7 and a right lateral hem
  section at T10 one of those things like if you knew what all those words meant then
  you would be able to say oh okay I understand all the details there over hem section
  means a little over half so they they didn't go to the halfway point they went over
  that um and so then what they do and so see if I can uh this on so now we put the
  mouse the rat mouse rat in this little robotic G entry system so this this is a
  uh there's other studies on this particular system but this is kind of the 2012
  version of that little wire wire uh support and treadmill thing from the cat um
  and so basically what they were able to do is it's like I think this is the best
  picture we're going to get in here and actually yeah I think well the almost certainly
  the supplemental information for the paper has many many things to say about this
  particular robotic system but basically it's like a kind of like a 3D printer if
  you ever seen that where it's kind of like a a a motor control that sort of moves
  over a 2d plane and then it sort of goes down to this kind of like supportive mechanism
  oh jeez and it supports the mouse of the Rat um partial body weight support so it's
  not it's not floating off the ground but it's also not holding its full body weight
  and and um and it allows it to turn and stuff like that while maintaining that body
  weight support so you know no matter what happens it's detecting what's going on
  and it's always making sure that the rat has you know 10 to 20% of its body weight
  on the ground the say and sure enough as we are sort of not surpris to learn um
  even after so this is the the activity also they they hold it upright so it walks
  in this kind of like bipedal way which is sort of would be cute if it wasn't so
  mob um and this is what intact means not chopped up um so the intact uh animal looks
  the the behavior looks like this so the trajectories in blue here are the trajectories
  of the feet um and this is all and they go here so we're not we are not shocked
  to learn that um even after uh yeah that even after this injury they can still walk
  decently okay like if you put them in a little robotic thing and drag them along
  they can walk just fine there's this complicated sort of like electrochemical thing
  that they put into their spine to make sure that the neurons are still sort of active
  and healthy and sort of firing hard enough to move the limbs um what they found
  with those cats is that even like the video you saw was probably right after that
  surgery was done but typically what happens is the behaviors kind of extinguish
  over time so like after a couple of hours or days or I think not more than not more
  than weeks um the cat would stop doing that behavior and if you put it back on the
  trebal would just kind of wind up dragging its feet um and so one of the results
  that they built on from their own labs building this sort of combination of like
  a pharmaceutical cocktail and a particular electrical stimulation pattern that allows
  them to keep the animals do like the deated animals doing this movement for a sort
  of arbitrary amount of time um and uh and yeah so that's I think that's the main
  that's the setup so we've got these we've got these they've been deated and they
  can do this sort of walking task and good for them um and so now here's where so
  that's all cool but none of it is shocking this is all stuff that we already knew
  when we showed the Cat video um so they're specific thing that they're trying to
  do is restore the animals ability to initiate walking um so a lot of this stuff
  is kind of like they're dragging it along like on a treadmill so it it gets this
  stimulus that it needs like the feet drag and they sort of pick then sensory signals
  pick up and they start taking steps um but that but the the rat cannot just sit
  there and just decide to start walking forward um so they're trying to restore that
  ability to do that and this is where there's a lot there's a lot going on here in
  terms of methodology that I'm not there's just too much depth to get into but I
  will say that they then they broke the animals up into two groups um one of the
  animals one of the groups of animals was getting the um the control condition I
  guess which was training so they they would they would do this surgery to them they
  would give them this Electro chemical prosthetic that allows them to sort of keep
  walking and then they would put them in this sort of robotic suit and they would
  have them do this like movement training so it take a bunch of steps in a bunch
  you know in a row um then the other group and this is where I think the main sort
  of like interesting nut of the paper comes in the other group would do a matched
  amount of training so a matched amount of steps but before they would start the
  robot thing pulling them forward they would put chocolate in front of their face
  and apparently rats like chocolate and so they put the chocolate in front of their
  face and the r goes oh I really want the chocolate and then the robot kind of pulls
  them forward and then they do the stepping behavior and then they get to eat the
  chocolate that was sort of presented to them so now we have two match groups of
  rats one is being trained and taking a bunch of steps with this robotic Gantry system
  the other is doing the exact same behaviors but they are being given a motivating
  a motivating food thing then they do the exact same steps and they receive the food
  as a reward for doing that and in the last 2 minutes of class if you sort of dig
  into all of this stuff what happens is that the animals that only do the base training
  don't get better and eventually they the behavior still becomes extinguished and
  they sort of they never regain that capacity the animals that get the chocolate
  reward experience this kind of regrowth pattern where they over enough time they
  see these connections getting formed that sort of bypass the injury site and over
  time they can put the chocolate in front of the the rat and the rat can actually
  initiate the stepping behavior before the robotic Gantry kind of pulls them forward
  and that is I think really amazing and the idea is that it Taps into the kind of
  the way that we that we move our bodies in the world it wasn't enough for the for
  the for the control rats to keep doing the stepping Behavior because it wasn't connected
  to anything in the world around it whereas the ones with the chocolate condition
  um they had the experience of oh there's a state there's something out there in
  the world that I want it's in front of me I need to walk to get it they start walking
  they don't know that they're being dragged by a robot and then as a result of that
  behavior they get to eat the chocolate and so when that happens it triggers this
  other concept of the dopamin neric reward system where basically basically the the
  brain gets flooded with this reward chemical that called dopamine and a bunch of
  other stuff that basically has the the the effect of reinforcing all the neurons
  that were just firing just dup energic award system is kind of how that works and
  so it's that connection between that sort of that frontal area that volitional sort
  of prefrontal lobe cortex thing of I wish I was over there so I could eat the chocolate
  and then a bunch of neural fa activity happens then you get to eat the chocolate
  and then your brain gets flooded with neurons that say whatever was just happening
  reinforce that and then that is enough to trigger regrowth of neurons at the spinal
  level and that is as much as I'm going to say about this paper and uh end of class
  so thanks for following along and uh I'll see you all on Wednesday going to do two
  papers someday I'll learn I'll never learn

  text: okay all right what hello everybody sorry for the slow start um trying to
    get some stuff downloaded I should have downloaded at home um yeah so standard
    check in so we are officially in week number six uh which is a Fine Place to be
    um so we've covered a lot of stuff uh I would say we've covered the majority of
    like the the I guess like the bi the hardcore biomechanics stuff like to I've
    almost said like the motor control stuff but I probably will get back to it um
    but we're going to take a little bit of time this week uh talking about just like
    we're g like today we're going to go through some examples of papers like direct
    like published papers something that i' really like so of have some experience
    sort of going through a published article and sort of try to make sense of that
    um and then on Wednesday we'll do kind of like the like a sort of a small group
    kind of assignment to help you all prepare for the sort of exam like assignment
    SL poster proposal too that we'll be do probably they'll both be kind of like
    connected to each other and be du at the end of that's this week um right next
    week um so yeah that's I got these wrong I'll fix that later um the so basically
    the idea is like you know at this point I've talked about some of the kind of
    the topic area stuff usually in the riew and then we spend a good amount of time
    recording some data in class and kind of just like eyeballing it like looking
    through it and sort of trying to figure out what kind of stories could be told
    there we came in with some sort of basic hypotheses and things like that um and
    so uh what I want the kind of this sort of Next twoe Period to be which you know
    next Monday is a holiday so it'll be next three classes is to prepare yall to
    kind of start thinking about your own chosen topic whatever that happens to have
    been um using the kind of like thought processes and mental Frameworks and stuff
    like that that I've been talking about in the context of human body human movement
    research uh based off of kinematic motion capture data um so what that's going
    to look like is you know sort of figuring out what the topic area you've chosen
    is um you've already done that to some extent um but sort of just you know digging
    into that a little bit more and then starting to think

  text: about uh the methodologies that are used to pursue your your topic of interest
    um I know that sort of the way that we gathered that it was sort of a combination
    of talking about topics and also picking a paper and the paper part is the sort
    of technically the most relevant part to the poster proposal but I want to make
    sure that that's couched in the context of like there's a reason why I like this
    paper and this because I'm interested in this topic um so trying to trying to
    sort of flesh out like the methodologies involved in your area of research um
    the kind of like and like the empirical sort of grounding of it like in the sense
    of so what are the methodologies used what are the tools that are used to collect
    the relevant data for whatever the topic may be um and then how does that kind
    of map on to the kind of conversations we've been having around cameras and motion
    capture and sort of you know what is the what is the sort of the core empirical
    tool involved what does it measure what are the sort of what are the units that
    get derived from that and what are the you know what are the the the data types
    and structures that the um that the sort of scientific insights in your area of
    focus are sort of build on top of um and that will kind of culminate into a sort
    of like a follow-up proposal like proposal proposal number two which will be uh
    sort of like a fleshed out version of the original sort of of like here's a paper
    I care about thing um so been thinking about like how what kind of mechanism I
    want to use for that sort of thing um and I think what it will wind up being is
    a a a a base level assignment that will live on canvas and in the GitHub repo
    uh that will involve you copy pasting some text uh from your own kind of like
    the profile thing that you have been generating and pasting that into a set of
    chats from the bot that will be sort of prompted in in the server um that will
    be sort of the idea will be like you'll you'll go in there you you'll start with
    whatever your last um whatever the the most relevant blob of text you have about
    what your interest are and what the paper is that you in the topic You' chosen
    take that into a chat space and then the bot in that space will be prompted to
    ask you about a certain sort of layer of the I've been talking about um and then
    at the end of that you'll ask it for a summary possibly using a prompt that I'll
    provide and then take that and put it into another chat and then have another
    sort of layer of conversation um and then the output of sort of those set of conversations
    will be something resembling the poster proposal to that will sort of be the fleshed
    out version of what you're looking at um and the reason for the structure is like
    I thought about trying to make just like like one chat like we've been doing that

  text: sort of does all the stuff but that starts getting really difficult and that
    starts getting into the space that these types of AI sort of as implemented here
    just can't really do like they're not really like it's like if you give it a set
    of instructions it's not really good at like two-part instructions like do this
    and then do that like it's just not set up for that you can set up the code on
    the back end to handle some of the stuff automatically but it's much much easier
    to just like make two versions of the prompt and then just give you the intelligent
    humans instructions that say do this and then do that um and the idea will be
    kind of like you know you'll be setting yourself up for the next conversation
    and that will also give you some sort of experience but like directed prompting
    and that kind of like aiish training thing um and like the the the conversations
    and prompts that I set up for you will be kind of built out of the lectures that
    I've been giving Which on the YouTube playlist which is linked in the server um
    so I'll be like you know doing something I've been doing might may not be obvious
    to you like of uh pulling the transcripts from those lectures and kind of pulling
    out the main points and sort of using that to help drive the conversation um and
    so that's why it will sort of I'm counting that sort of set of chats as like an
    exam like object where you will have a set of things to do um and if you don't
    do those things you'll get a bad gr and it will be somehow culminative and based
    off of stuff that has happened before which I think is like the legal definition
    of a test um and then that will kind of set you up for The Proposal Part which
    is another requirement of the structure of the classes to make sure that by this
    week um pushing it um you're set up to actually hypothetically start working on
    the actual poster with the kind of fleshed out nature that that needs to be um
    so I will it's the the lecture pulling stuff is the reason why I'm not ready to
    give you anything today but I have all that stuff it's kind of like uploading
    like the videos they they take a long time to upload so I have to wait for the
    last one to get up there because I only put it up this morning um but I'll have
    something kind of put together and started for that by next Wednesday um so that
    way we can sort of talk about it in class you can ask questions things like that
    um and then you know leading in that be sort of uh hypothetically Doe by the end
    of week seven which is next week and so now I'm going to give a little bit of
    time talking about the the posters themselves and sort of I'll put some templates
    into the um into the server and I I'll get those in the relevant place on campus
    soon um but before I do that before you look to closly uh there any questions
    so far any

  text: sort of like concerns stress levels things that if you knew you would feel
    more comfortable about your status here someone sent me an email asking about
    the poster like structure itself for that's what we're going to talk about today
    um yeah great okay okay so the poster itself these are just some examples that
    I found um from previous courses taught uh which is made more difficult because
    I don't have PowerPoint on this computer um but that's okay okay we that one um
    so this is a PowerPoint slide uh it is you know PowerPoint or Google Slides I
    think it's the equivalent or keynote on Mac is the equivalent of that um I'm sure
    a lot of you has PowerPoint slides in it um but it's long story short the nice
    thing about something like a PowerPoint is that is a vector-based art thing um
    meaning that these visuals are defined not by sort of pixels on an image like
    a lot like most images like if you zoom in on them they start you could start
    to see the pixels um uh Vector base Graphics are not like that they are because
    they're defined mathematically like this curve here is not defined as a set of
    dots it's defined as like a mathematical definition of how to draw this shape
    and everything on the PowerPoint page is that way so the advantage there is that
    you can zoom it up infinitely and you'll never see the pixels because it is not
    based on pixels um the opposite of vector base is raster based um and that's most
    images where if like you take a screenshot and zoom in it start you can only zoom
    in to the level of the resolution of the image um so most posters are made with
    a vector-based visualization method um PowerPoint is I would say like the entry
    level version of that PowerPoint are an equivalent of PowerPoint um and for the
    vast majority of you I would say almost all of you except for someone who has
    like a really specific interest in like design um I would just say use use PowerPoint
    use Google whatever it is use whatever just make basically a single page a single
    slide that has information about your poster there if you're feeling fancy and
    want to do the prograde version of this um the professional version of a vector
    graphics editor is called Adobe Adobe Illustrator is like the main one um you
    all have free access to the Adobe Creative s Suite through your Northeastern email
    email um you don't

  text: know how to do that just ask someone that's not me um how to get access no
    yeah just yeah you just kind of you just download and log in right you just download
    Creative Cloud and just log in with your north eastern account no you have to
    uh you have to go to a a specific website and then go to and submit a request
    for a license okay well that's too bad but it takes like a day or so a day or
    two yeah so if you're into that you can do it um there's also um inkscape is a
    free version of Adobe Illustrator um which I've used it I sort of in the way that
    these things tend to go like the free version has kind of been in development
    for a long time when I was in grad school it wasn't very good and wouldn't be
    what I would consider like like an like a viable alternative um but I've used
    it recently and it's gotten pretty good I think for basic usage it might be helpful
    but it but realistically don't expect it to sort of be at the same level as illustrator
    but also realistically if you're new to that space you're not going to be using
    the pro tool to the pro level so you can give it a shot um and whatever you choose
    I would say like the stuff that we'll be doing to prepare like the content of
    the poster will be independent of the poster itself so if you want to try a fancy
    thing and then sort of be like I don't want to do this um you can convert later
    uh okay so what should actually go on the poster itself um the basically a poster
    is like a distillation of a paper that's kind of I think the best way to think
    about it at the level that we're doing in this class um that's not all that a
    poster has to be um it could be other things um but the default sort of purpose
    of a poster is to kind of give you a representation of a particular study typically
    that you typically i' say almost exclusively that you yourself are doing um so
    that you can take it to something like a conference and then put it up and then
    have then stand next to it and hope people come by and talk to you about it um
    I showed you some pictures of like scientific conference poster sessions you can
    just you know sort of uh that's the that is the the structure that's being sort
    of mimicked here um so and at the end of the semester that roughly speaking where
    they go uh the week of April 7th there will be a poster session for all the inquiries
    classes and you'll be assigned one of the days and that will be your day to present
    um and you'll present your poster along with half of the students in each other
    class and then if you're not presenting then your assignment will be to go around
    and partake in the posters um including

  text: you know a certain number of posters from this class and a certain number
    of posters from the other classes so you can kind of like get the experience of
    what that sort of process looks like and feels like um yeah so yeah so like I
    said I said before and we'll say again um there there's kind of there's the default
    version of the assignment and then there's kind of the whatever else you want
    to do part of the assignment um so I'm mostly going to be talking about the default
    assignment which is just pick a paper and present that paper as if you were you
    know a person I don't I don't know if they like what the other class say in terms
    of like should be like role playing like a grass in the lab or should you I think
    that gets kind of weird just or you can just be like my paper they blah blah blah
    just talk about it in the third person um but yeah but you also have the option
    of like you know if you want to add more citations there if you want to talk about
    other things um I think if you want to use any of the data that we use in this
    class as part of your poster um we can sort of set that up basically like any
    of the data that you've seen before now before April 7th I'll have I'll make that
    into a place where you can like pull screenshots and sort of just like talk about
    it um if you wanted to have the experience of using like actual data that you've
    been a part of as part of your presentation that's a viable option um yeah so
    in terms of yeah so in terms of like how do you put the poster together together
    how do you you know from a given paper or topic area how do you actually create
    a poster uh that's where there is sort of like instructions about that um which
    I think might on this one there are some instructions from other classes that
    I'll I'll pull up that are sort of more written setup but um the basic idea is
    that you're not what you're not supposed to do is put all the information in the
    poster all the information in the paper on the poster um you don't want to have
    what we call affectionately um a wall of text poster we all know what it feels
    like to be confronted with a big wall of text it's not fun um and it doesn't really
    it's not helpful to you as a as a person coming in um something that I think really
    needs to be driven home over and over and over again is that science the scientific
    process is primarily a process of communication if you're

  text: sitting alone in your lab collecting data and running running numbers and
    stuff like that and you never actually show it to anybody else you're not actually
    doing science you're just kind of like you're doing an investigation you're playing
    around with data but the process of science is is a process of communication so
    when you're present in this sort of interface of a poster or a paper um is the
    traditional method for communicating science to other people uh presenting a poster
    in a conference kind of you know I I say unofficially counts as a peer- review
    type of session but you can't say this is a peer reviewed poster um but you are
    getting it reviewed by your peers um in the sense that you know people other people
    who know the area are going to look at what you've done and hypothetically have
    the option of saying oh hey you made a mistake here there or the other um which
    is a Cornerstone of how we do sort of science you know I'm sort of I'm talking
    about a system that I'm pretty uh jaded about so I'll talk about it kind of in
    the idealized form um so so yeah so so when you are translating whatever poster
    you're doing whatever topic you're doing whatever project you're doing into poster
    form it your job is to kind of do the distillation like it's you're the you're
    the person hypothetically who understands the project better than anyone else
    like argue like if it's your research project you probably understand the nitty-gritty
    of it better than anybody else in the world and the people that you're going to
    be communicating with are only going to be talking to you for like a couple of
    minutes like you know 5 10 minutes at most you know not at most but um a very
    short amount of time like if you look at you know the picture of like sfn or something
    like that there's thousands and thousands of posters and if you're a person you're
    not going to see all of them you're going to go to a particular area but you're
    not going to be spending hours and hours on each poster you're going to be kind
    of coming up and saying hey what's what's the deal here and your job as the presenter
    is to be able to give them the deal like tell them what was what the study was
    and what what happened at a level where if they just sat there quietly and listen
    to you then you could get sort of from start to finish let's say within 3 to 5
    minutes um and the person listening knows enough of what's going on that they
    can walk away and say oh yeah that poster they did this thing they found this
    result they you know they will if you've done a good job they will walk away with
    a certain sort of gut level takeaway um that they can that they will then be able
    to explain what your study was about without having to know all the details itself
    um so there's a certain strategy on what you put on a poster uh where you want
    to make sure that you are like the takeaways that that person walks away with
    should be the takeaways that you want them to walk away with like there's a lot
    of things in a given research

  text: study um and you can present the same study in five different ways and sort
    of have the person walk away with five different hopefully not like in hopefully
    not like incon herent inconsistent beliefs but you know you can focus on you know
    one thing or another and you want to make sure that you're packaging it in a way
    that will they will be able to understand that will stick and that they will be
    able to walk away and when they say hey that study over there was was about this
    person doing this thing and finding this result that they're saying roughly speaking
    what you believe about that thing um now I said if that's what would happen if
    the person just stands there politely and doesn't say anything which sometimes
    is what happens and typically it's not uh the um it's not it's not necessarily
    an insult especially at conferences that people are tired and they want to get
    the the the gist but um in general in Academia and the Sciences if somebody starts
    criticizing your work a lot and then just starts pulling it to pieces and picking
    up the threads it's that's a compliment like they care enough about what you're
    doing to think about it and ask questions and it could be really offputting to
    people especially students who are used to fatigue being like to give you a a
    rank order in your grade um but if I'm asking a lot of questions it's because
    I want to know more and I'm I'm using my time and my energy and my attention to
    do the thing that I was train to do as a scientist who is peer reviewing other
    other research which is to look for problems look for mistakes um not necessarily
    to like not necessarily like to Target the mistakes but just because I want to
    understand what's going on and I want to make sure that it was done right because
    we're trying to sort of create new knowledge here um so that's where the second
    part of the strategy comes in where if you're presenting the poster you're never
    please do not just read it to the person that's not fun for anybody um but you're
    going to present it in a high level way and then so that when the person asks
    questions ideally you have the answer to that question right there W waiting so
    even though you might be just zipping through this and sort of like moving past
    this stuff because it's your study there's a certain like the first time you present
    something you might be surprised by the questions that you get but after the first
    couple of conversations you realize that 90% of the questions that you get are
    predictable in some way and so you should just have those questions sort of answerable
    from the data that's on the paper so you know this type of stuff is a good example
    where I wouldn't want to be talking about um oh yeah we did this study with this
    mouse Maze and there was the water was this deep and the thing was this big I
    don't want to be describing the size of the whole of the of the apparatus but
    if the person asks how deep it was I should have an answer for it and actually
    they wouldn't even have to ask

  text: that question they can just look at the picture and get that themselves um
    similarly with a lot of like the the method like often times that's where you
    put like details that you know you wouldn't necessarily say you could say oh yeah
    we have this rat do this thing and this maze but the details are there so the
    person can just kind of skim them and kind of know the answer there um and yeah
    and I will say I think that the you know there should be some kind of a methods
    section uh which should have some visual representation of like what you actually
    did what the study actually was like you know this is a good example because it's
    like I know by looking at this that you looked at mice in a water bucket with
    a camera you know you could just as easily have you know if you skip this type
    of thing oh yeah you have this with a camera and I know that there were three
    conditions and one of them was a sham meaning they didn't give it do anything
    one is injured and one is whatever this condition is and so now I have a sense
    of like what it is that you actually did it's really easy when you know something
    too well to skip the parts I call it skipping Step Zero it's like the things the
    immediate questions that anybody coming into would ask are the first things that
    you forget to explain when you get into it so it's like you know you can have
    this if you're just showing the result blah blah blah blah blah I could be like
    halfway into my conversation but then my person asked wait are these mice are
    they rats are they fruit flies are are they on a treadmill are these celegans
    you know they start asking questions that make it clear it's like oh they don't
    even know like basic thing that I did which is stand in a room with m in a water
    bat um so the method section should always have something that just makes it clear
    what that is in my preference that will typically be figure one in whatever paper
    you're looking at this isn't always the case but I I think this is true for papers
    as well like figure one or something very close to figure one should be some kind
    of a picture that makes it clear what you're actually doing and the results over
    here um should be some representation of the data that was recorded uh typically
    there's going to be I guess yeah you want there to be some nice Harmony here um
    and this is also typically where you are it's your job to kind of choose the most
    important data um for a lot of papers and certainly for a lot of studies you're
    produce a lot of data um and a lot of visualizations showing various things related
    to the data that you recorded um like whatever paper you choose like it could
    have you know five six 10 or more um figures of data in it but your job is to
    understand what's the main figure what's the main result you know and if I if
    if I can only show one or two results from this

  text: paper what should those results be and those should be the results that back
    up the conclusions and then keep your directions if that's appropriate um of the
    study itself so I you know introduction is typically it's kind of like the you
    know here's why we did this this is where you can have citations if you want them
    like we did this because it's related to this other study that did this other
    thing we did this because there is this group of papers that sort of suggested
    this effect is true and so we did this study to test if that effect is true um
    breaking it out into research question hypothesis is fine not everything has this
    stuff so delineate if it's fine uh some kind of method saying here's what we did
    some kind of a data data representation of like here's the main results and some
    kind of a conclusion because of all the stuff that we did we believe that some
    fact of the world is the case um some new proposed fact of the world is the case
    like I this this is ifate the part where you say the things that you now believe
    because of the research that you did and you hope that after going through this
    little journey people that you're talking to the people who are reading the paper
    um will also believe you they'll say yeah the things that you're describing seem
    supported they seem reasonable I will go along with you on this you know and then
    if enough people are convinced by the story that you've told it becomes a quote
    unquote scientific fact which is always something to be wary of because we're
    always wrong about everything and and every scientific fact will be proven wrong
    in the fullness of time um so but we do our best in the moment um one so the so
    generally speaking uh by generally speaking I'll say you will pretty much never
    read a poster to a person like if it's your poster don't read it to the person
    have some other way of talking about it but the idea is that if the person had
    the poster given to them and they read it from start to finish they would know
    roughly speaking the story that you're trying to tell um and so in the poster
    itself for the actual presentation is kind of there as like an it's sort of an
    aid for you um explaining what you're doing so you have so you you don't you can
    remember what they're talking about you have things you can point to you have
    data you can point to um but yeah sort of a yeah it's kind of the process there
    I should also say this is another sort of classic uh way of presenting data where
    these a points up here are what you would call Representative data and then this
    here is some measure of the like the statistics of that data so representative
    data is basically like you can choose like you the researcher because you are
    a trustworthy person who's not lying and has ear methods

  text: appropriately documented you are allowed to look at the big body of data that
    you have and pick a particular recording that is representative of the of what
    you're trying to show um so you might record um so yeah so in this case they put
    mice in a water bucket and then they had to learn where platform was so they can
    sort of get out of the water um and our case we were doing stuff like you know
    the jumping task or you know the standing task and so for the standing so imagine
    for the standing task we recorded 25 different uh participants and you know and
    each of them did 10 different repetitions of beta that's that 200 some of Trials
    whatever um you can go in and kind of pick one trial or even one section of one
    trial that exemplifies the effect that you're trying to show um and then just
    click about that one little part sort of clean up and then past it there and say
    this is representing a data from a subject in the partip stud um but that's not
    really that's an without additional support that is anecdotal that is you just
    sort of picking one from a set of a thousand options and saying this is the one
    that looks like the story that I'm trying to tell that's not that that's not really
    evidence on itself so you want to have you want to be able to back that up by
    having some kind of a measure of Statistics that is looking at all 1,000 trials
    that you did and sort of appropriately comparing you know subjects to subjects
    and conditions to conditions and da da da um so that this is where you actually
    start having statistical power and statistically supported statements and this
    is these are the data that kind of like this is where like the real grounding
    and sort of knowledge generation comes from um but it's good to kind of pair both
    because you know the representative subject data helps the kind of understand
    what you're talking about um or the statistical data helps them understand that
    this is a thing that happens in general um that's always going to be different
    based on the studies and stuff that you're that you're doing um you want to see
    posters um generally if you just walk around a department in the school you'll
    see posters on the wall um people put their favorite posters on the walls outside
    their lab uh and so you can just walk around and take a look at what they would
    look like and sort of just get a sense of the sort of the styles that are available
    and sort of the choices that are made and you'll see some with a ton of words
    on them you'll see some with very few words on them um and I recommend just doing
    that just go whatever hours the day you want through whatever you know wherever
    the various Departments of the school are and you'll you'll typically find posters
    on the wall that you can sort of look at um in our case the sizes can be very

    24 by 36 Ines um which is like this big but I can't recall I'll I'll look that
    up that's that's a relevant thing to have but mostly that will just affect the
    font size that you use um this is again with the vector scale stuff like the actual
    scale shouldn't matter too much um yeah so but it does depend like you know you
    want to make sure that the font size is not oppressive [Music] um yeah also just
    Google scientific poster you'll find a lot of examples uh is the kind of thing
    that there will be many many layers of explication and tutorials about how to
    make a good this and how to do a good that and that will all be relevant here
    um with the exception that you won't be writing paper yourself a lot of this stuff
    is just going to be sort of copy pasting from the paper itself just you know get
    the figure put it up and um then these sort of the section down here in the bottom
    right will be where you put your citations that will be generated from Soo or
    whatever else uh yeah yeah so we'll we'll go through this and then on a particular
    day of yeah so yeah so the the poster needs to be uploaded by Tuesday March 25th
    uh which means that you'll upload a PDF and then it'll get printed um they charge
    you for it I want to say like 20 something bucks I can't remember exactly I'll
    get that number too um but that's due at the end where 25th is oh that's due on
    the Monday so two weeks before the actual poster session which is mostly um because
    as you can imagine the the printer office gets for this course hundreds I guess
    of posters so we want to make sure to give them enough lead time that they can
    get it all pretty in case anything goes wrong um and there'll be instructions
    on how to do that and you know all that good stuff yeah and this I will um so

  text: canvas just so it's available I please load up any questions or confusions
    s okay yeah so like I just do my poster on one paper I just do that on paper is
    there any otheres not really no um like by the the base level assignment that
    so so they had a couple yeah um that was S I say again was that they only reference
    it in int I'm actually I was looking for that uh cuz I actually can't see see
    where these citations actually happen in the poster uh I guess this that might
    be something I can't remember so I would actually say they may have this may have
    just been like incorrectly done because you're supposed to site stuff here but
    this again for this assignment it's a little bit weird um so I'd say like the
    default assumption is that there's you know the base level assignment is that
    there's only going to be one citation here and it's the citation of the actual
    p paper um where you got the things um I would still say you should site it somewhere
    in the like in either in the introduction or in the conclusions and say you know
    this and that study did this you know you this one either have the one or CH at
    all 2018 just had that cited somewhere in the text um and yeah so in default assumption
    is that's just the one paper uh it's also the kind of case I think as you go into
    your paper there might be some other obvious choices to site like you know you
    know future directions could you like oh there are some follow-up studies that
    were done after this was post to be cited there um in in their introduction they
    might say we're doing this because of this other paper and then you can just site
    that one too um if you wind up you know they're using some weird method that you
    don't understand and then you go find the review article that says here's how
    that method works and how it's used if you use that as part of your development
    of the poster that's a good thing that you would want to just have some citations
    somewhere and then just put it down there um you know citations in this context
    are often used as kind of like you know it's a rubric it's like it's like oh you
    have to have this many in order for it to be a valid thing um but that's obviously
    nonsense that's not how we use it in in the real world when you're you just you
    site stuff that you have used to say to understand all the work in this poster

    on the basis of the stuff that I have you know read before like I'm I'm building
    this on other people's work and if I'm doing that I need to cite it because you
    know for if you're trying to figure out if you should trust this resource that
    I'm presenting you I need to tell you that the stuff I'm presenting depends on
    work that has come before me and this is that work so hypothetically if you really
    really didn't trust somebody when they're presenting their data to you you can
    go back and look at all the things that they're depending on and this is where
    you get into this Con there's like a concept of like citation networks and stuff
    like that where you know any study that has a certain am number of citations you
    can Bounce from that study to other studies and sort of navigate all the empirical
    work that has been done in the world for you know at least since whatever 1800s
    when sure of keeping track of this stuff um so so yeah so but for the for the
    strict assignment it's just one thing and in general when it comes to posters
    the citation thing is a little it's it's it's much squishier like like posters
    are generally speaking kind of an informal type of presentation um not always
    some conferences are are pretty serious about them but I think for the convers
    that are serious about their poster sessions the posters are always paired with
    a paper so you write a six-page paper or whatever Accord that to go along with
    a poster and the poster itself is you sort of often just sort of like you print
    it for the conference and then you just use it to discuss at the conference and
    then it's not going to go into some like you know the anals of some scientific
    Society or something like that so they're generally just sort of treat it as a
    much more informal type of thing and then the actual like the actual proper like
    review process is done at the level of Articles and papers make sense yeah anything
    else any other questions thoughts feelings cool all right yeah yeah we'll we'll
    I'll be sure to plan some time somewhere probably somewhere in this sort of two
    week chunk oh yeah do at the beginning of this week so I'll plan there'll be something
    in this chunk to kind of like practice your poster now I'll try to do it the week
    before it goes because it's often like you put you put the poster together and
    then you start explaining you're like oh this is not at all what I want so I will

  text: demo run probably in this week um so that you'll have a you have a chance
    to kind of go through it with your peers before you're doing it in person um it
    is also just absolutely standard experience that when you're presenting a poster
    for the first time the first couple people that you present it to get the worst
    version of the story and generally speaking speaking by the end of the session
    which you know for a lot of conferences can be like you know 3 4 hours rather
    long time um you have by by the end of that poster session you have the story
    of your research so down like so perfectly down that it's like if you ever find
    yourself going to a conference and presenting a poster I beg of you to do yourself
    the favor of taking notes voice notes text notes whatever you can about what you've
    been talking about in your poster like the moment the poster session is done because
    the story that you're trying to tell will never be clearer in your mind than it
    will be after you have pulled it you know however many dozens of times you do
    um and that's another like within the context of like how science operates and
    sort of a practical communal sense that is often the purpose of a poster session
    um not always the case but generally the case posters and also talks like most
    of the times when you're when you're presenting stuff at a conference it's stuff
    that you're working on it's not stuff that's you you typically I mean it sort
    of depends on the cycle but you I think if if you're really using the conference
    to its fullest extent you should be presenting stuff that's not quite done yet
    it's not ready for prime time it's not published it's not peer-reviewed it's the
    paper that you're currently writing not the one that you just published um because
    this poster session the poster session in particular is a really great opportunity
    to like hone the story that you're telling um and when you know and ask questions
    someone you know say oh yeah we use this method I'm kind of I'm new to this and
    someone's going to come by and like oh I actually know that method quite well
    and then you can ask them that question when it comes up um you know you might
    have a certain way of saying it that like the first couple times you do it people
    don't really get it and then you figure out some turn of phrase that makes everyone
    go oh right now I see what's going on and that's the way that you want to describe
    it like you know when you're describing the methods like you know you'll you'll
    often this is this is absolutely the most classic student behavior that ever exists
    you'll describe it in way too much detail um and then eventually you'll learn
    all the details that you can leave out that help people understand what it is
    with with the minimum amount of time and then that's the way you should learn
    how to talk about the stuff that you're doing they're very classic especially
    for grass students like The Birth down grass students start presenting uh research
    they will um they will spend

    to the amount of time that they spent working on that area and that's almost never
    what you should do like it's possible that whoever these people are spent a good
    four to five months trying to figure out how to make the water in the stupid thing
    stopped leaking out and they kept using there some thing that wasn't working and
    they figured out the glue and then blah blah blah blah blah and like that's and
    then when they actually got it working the data just kind of fell out of it and
    so when they give the presentation they're going to spend the first half of the
    conversation talking about all the glue that they had to use and how the the leak
    you know how they sort of got the the water up to the right level and da da da
    da da that stuff shouldn't even be a part of the conversation you just that part
    off sometimes when I'm giving a presentation I'll just say in this slide transition
    was 6 months of my life and then I just show the result where it worked and not
    the 15 iterations of failed attempts that I had to do before I got the version
    that works um if the things that you were doing to make it work are interesting
    you might want to record them in another place but a poster is almost never that
    time um and then that might be the case where someone comes along go how'd you
    get your stupid thing to fill up because ours keeps leaking that's when you can
    say oh yeah we use this glue and not the other glue and that's the place where
    like at the end of the paper that you wind up publishing on it you can have the
    very long methods where you can have a little section about why you have to use
    this glue and not the other glue and da da da da um yeah so it's the process of
    kind of distillation that I think is really the nut of this assignment um and
    it is your job as the sort of the ambassador of This research study to to to make
    the call to make the Judgment call about what what's the most important part and
    what's the narrative that we're going to try to pursue here okay yeah right we
    good cool um yeah and we will have plenty more opportunity to talk about this
    stuff in your specific case but um cool all right now with all of that said let
    us just let's go and look at at a paper and let's see so we have approximately
    40 minutes left and I am going to attempt to do to look at two separate papers
    which is a terrible idea because I've already done the thing of saying this is
    going to have an and in the lecture um and I love the papers I'm talking about

    data there um and yeah so so what I'm going to do now with this study because
    I know this study quite well uh I'm going to try to give you something like a
    very high level overview of this paper that ideally will both be fast enough that
    I can do it in the next 15 minutes um comprehensible enough that you'll be able
    to follow the story despite not being sort of particularly trained in this area
    um and ideally a sort of fair and honest representation of what was actually being
    done so that if you were to take the time so sort of read this paper in depth
    and sort of get through all the nitty-gritty you would come out of it saying oh
    yeah everything that John said about this is an accurate representation like I'm
    creating the cartoon Narrative of the study so that I can present it to you in
    a way that will sort of handle itself and if you became an expert on this area
    and on this paper ideally you would be able to evaluate my choices of cartoon
    ification and understand why I choosing this form of the cartoon and not some
    other form of the cartoon this so so yeah so this is a study about the spinal
    cord and particular it's looking at spinal cord injury and trying to get at something
    like a what has been a sort of Holy Grail type of thing for quite some time which
    is the ability to heal spinal cord injuries like you you know you get an injur
    you get an accident your spinal cord is damaged and you lose control of your limbs
    below that area may you might lose control of your legs you might lose control
    of your whole body depending on where that injury occurs and we really really
    would like it if we could correct that in some way um which yeah the same way
    that we can correct it when you break your ankle or you know damage some muscle
    damage some skin we would love to be able to correct that on a person um yeah
    so this here is the abstract of the paper um again different journals will sort
    of format this in different ways this one's not even labeling it as the abstract
    they kind of assume that you know that um but sometimes it might be called a summary
    sometimes it might be called something else um I know noticed that on yeah so
    on the actual website they're

  text: giving a sort of a high level summary in addition to the abstract um but yeah
    all the information should rly speaking be there um so this study Builds on so
    this study so the the application is for uh is in the space of trying to sort
    of heal spinal cord injury um but this study is not looking at patient populations
    they're not looking at people who have spinal cord injuries um they are looking
    specifically at rats um and this is where like if you look at any so these numbers
    here are the citations and if you scroll to the the end of the paper uh they will
    correspond to the actual citations there um these are in science format um sometimes
    you'll see citations where it's like author year so it's like you know Mathis
    edel 2019 or something like that that's APA format this is a more engineering
    style literally just because it's it's made to be shorter um and see if you look
    at these citations they will be referencing clinical studies and medical studies
    and things like that um but they are not themselves doing research on humans this
    is a this is an application with a basic science sort of motivation where they're
    trying to have a theoretical they're trying to increase theoretical understanding
    but they're doing it in service of being able to move towards this applied goal
    um and they are building on a history of studies of um studying Central pattern
    gener spinal Central pattern generators in mammals um those Central pattern generators
    exist in pretty much all animals not not necessarily all animals but many many
    animals um and they they generally refer to neural architectures that generate
    rhythmic Activation so it's some sort of like a metronome type of activ of activity
    uh which is the basis of a lot of motor behavior and just um General life so let's
    see so so this is a really fun animation of a ant walking alternating tripod gate
    so the red or one tripod blue or another tripod that's how insects operate and
    that's a rhythmic Behavior breathing is a rhythmic Behavior most forms of locomotion
    ayic Behavior flapping is a rhythmic Behavior it's the kind of thing that is present
    down to invertebrates like insects and also present up to mammals like us and

  text: um spinal cpg cat uh and this particular study is following a particular sort
    of branch of um of ways of studying that idea of central pendon where specifically
    as they exist in the spines of invertebrates um because it's kind of this like
    there's a general question around like we know that cpgs are present in lower
    animals we can study them very carefully in those animals um because they're simpler
    and you know we can sort of open them up and sort of see these things happening
    um but then the question kind of arises like what is the role of these types of
    neural architectures in more complex animals like mammals who have many many many
    more neurons and have many many many or mag more complex behaviors um but still
    have the same sort of evolutionary history um so this is a a a video which is
    quite old and kind of from an era sort of a different era of like animal rights
    I'll say um so this shows a cat that has been uh decerebrated um so it's hard
    to see but this is this is the cat and it's being supported by these liars and
    this cat has had its spine SED here so from so let's see how you drop so that's
    the brain and then that's the cerebellum and that's their spine and then these
    are the legs and I think for this era they would sever the spine there so they
    they surgically cut the spinal cord so that there is no information going from
    the legs to the brain and no information going from the brain to the legs um and
    so the legs are still connected to the spinal cord here um and then kind of the
    interesting result here is that if the cat is supported and walking on a treadmill
    the hind limbs are still walking they're still doing the rhythmic behavior of
    locomotion being driven by the sensory motor Loops from the feet up through the
    spine and sort of back so this is kind of counter to a lot of our intuitions about
    how the Spine Works um which we tend to think of it as like a there yeah um you
    have to think of this just kind of like extension cables that sort of lead from
    like the brain down to the dumb muscles um but this

  text: type of stuff shows that there is processing happening in there like your
    spinal cord is a part of your central nervous system and it can handle simple
    stuff like the sensory information coming off of the feet um is enough to generate
    the behavior that leavs the feet to sort of like if I'm being pushed backwards
    at a certain point I should lift up go forward and come down again and the two
    limbs are sort of reciprocally activated by Central pattern generators in the
    spine and so that not only can the cat walk um despite having no cerebral implant
    to their spine to the back legs as the as the treadmill speeds up they speed up
    with it um which is just sort of chew on that you seem perturbed it just feels
    wrong yeah yeah yeah yeah uh it's it's it's a wild result just to be clear and
    it absolutely is baffling in many layers and levels um but and probably is when
    I like to study so much um and it's kind of like you know as is often the case
    um it's those parts of the empirical investigation where you go oh wait that's
    not what I was expecting we're often the best investigations live um because despite
    how strange that is uh I'm giving up on the second paper we're going to focus
    on this one um for the rest of the class uh we'll talk about the next one the
    next one about dragon flies we'll talk about that once we've done more Vision
    stuff about vision and dragon flies we'll get there um so so yeah so the um so
    despite that being a sort of strange and baffling study um um it has it's also
    venerable like it's it's been around for a while we've known about this for a
    while that there are these Central pattern generators that govern movement and
    they handle like things like the basic trade-offs between you know the limbs going
    from stance to swing and stuff like that um and so there's been active areas of
    research since then trying to understand the nature of these spinal cpgs and trying
    to understand like you know where they how they operate and sort of what the connection
    is between the brain and the and the like the upper level of the brain and the
    lower level of the spine and sort of into the peripheral nerves and stuff like
    that um and those Studies have evolved uh there was some point in time I'm not
    really sure the exact history here uh where you know the animal rights rules kind
    of evolved uh and at some point they were like don't use cats for that anymore
    um the rules about animal ethics are

  start: 3960.0
  text: interesting and complicated I'll talk about them at some point um but there
    are kind of like rules about like which animal you're allowed to use for which
    study and there are some kind of like strange designations for like higher higher
    level versus lower level and typically speaking the closer you get to a humanlike
    animal the the the more stringent the standards are so like we do still use non
    human primates for Neuroscience research we don't use apes and chimpanzees um
    but if you want to do monkey research you have to really really justify that you
    that you're doing research that needs to be done that it needs to be done on a
    non-human primate um and so at some point they you know they decided that you
    can't do it on cats anymore so now they do similar stuff with rats so this study
    was done with rats um and this also by the way has a really fun Ted talk about
    it um where Greg Lut is very very like smarmy French type of thing which is is
    a really good presentation um if you can get past the kind of like the Ted Talk
    of it all um but it's a good job of like telling an interesting story um although
    yeah the way he tells his story is actually not the way I tell my story because
    that's another sort of point to to call out here I am telling you this story as
    I have internalized it like I me as a particular individual human scientist with
    a particular background and sort of like area of the world that I'm trying to
    make sense of when I tell you the story about this paper it's going to be different
    than if the the authors of the study told you this paper or if somebody with a
    different background and interest set were tell you the story of this paper um
    there's this sort of context of like narrative that keeps coming up um that feels
    sort of like unexpected in a sort of discussion of like scientific empirical studies
    but remember this is all stuff being done by humans and we only remember stories
    that make sense to us um and so I'm going to tell the story I'm going to tell
    you sort of highlights a particular area of this that I think is sort of I found
    motivating um since I gave myself a little bit more time also talk a little bit
    more structurally about this paper uh so these are all authors of the paper they
    all contributed in some way um the the person at the front is the first author
    typically speaking this is like the owner of this the person who like did the
    work and sort of own the project generally speaking um this is going to be like
    a grad student or a post do or something like that the last author is the often
    times the senior author um so generally speaking not always the case um and this
    does this is somewhat Fu dependent but in most like biology related neuroscience
    types of of of studies the last author is the person who runs the lab where the
    study was

  text: done and the first author is the person in the lab that generally did that
    work um again it's very it's very that's all very very it varies dramatically
    by paper and by field and by whatnot um but if you're like in grad school or a
    postd something like that like you they you will be considering your first author
    Publications differently from your non-ir author Publications the people in the
    middle are people typically people that like helped out in some way um but they
    were not like the owner of the study um yeah then once you get to not once you
    start publishing papers and start looking doing things that involve paper publishing
    um people will ask you questions about how many first author Publications do you
    have versus second author Publications typically you'll have more second author
    pubs than first author pubs and then once you get to the point where you actually
    are running lab people will start asking questions about how many last author
    Publications you have meaning are you training people to do this work appropriately
    um again that's very field dependent um math people when they publish math papers
    they publish their authors alphabetically which is wild to me um but what I'm
    describing here is like sort of like standard cultural practice in contemporary
    scientific publishing um down here you got all these little citations showing
    what these numbers correspond to so like where they're working most of the work
    with done in Switzerland U and it's also going to tag um oh here's a tag that
    says okay so these two have a star that says these authors contributed equally
    to this work which is something it's a way that people try to get around the the
    first authoress of it but I guarantee you there was a discussion about despite
    them being starred who actually gets to be first and then this one is also important
    uh this is the corresponding author so this little symbol here says that if you
    want to ask a question about this paper you should contact this guy so that's
    typically going to be in there um and also I will go to the end just because again
    from a structural perspective um there's always going to be something like an
    acknowledgement somewhere in the paper and they're going to they'll do like thanks
    you know thank you for this person for helping with the robotic interface and
    da da d da um but they will also generally not not generally always should um
    site their funding sources so where did the money come from like in in this case
    they're listing a bunch of Grants from uh European research councils and d d this
    is an expensive St there a bunch of Grants but it's sort of a you know there's
    always going to be something saying thanks to the NIH for giving me this grant
    or whatever um and

  text: typically uh this is another place where like you say hey thanks for giving
    me this Grant and you tell you say this is this is you know Grant number is this
    so you can for public grants which most of these are you can go on you can go
    look up the grant that was written to fund This research and sort of see what
    they were talking about there so it's just kind of another way that people kind
    of keep connected to the larger uh Community when they're publishing particular
    papers um yeah modern papers also tend to talk they have a like a of like very
    like more recent than 2012 you'll it's more common to see uh sections that say
    that list out what each author did so like this person helped collect the data
    this person wrote the thing and there'll be a a paragraph or two saying what each
    author actually did when they were like how do they earn their spot on the on
    the author list okay so this particular study um this is your figure one figure
    one this style of figure is very common in like science and nature um journals
    because science and nature journals are very very short and very very dense this
    is also specifically um a report um which is you know generally speaking the journal
    will have like oh we have articles which are full length and like report which
    is short length and you know brief communication which is some other length and
    it's just so this is a report which is like this the T it's not the longest format
    it's the second it's like a a shorter form and this whole this whole study is
    five pages including uh the this front page so it's only four written pages of
    text and then probably if you go to those supplemental documents it's going to
    be when you go to the supplemental stuff it's typically going to look like a Microsoft
    Word document converted to PDF and it's going to be dozens to possibly more um
    Pages um but this study yeah so this picture with very dense with like letter
    um sort of sub panels um in particular with this kind of like professional looking
    animation sort of or visualization here very indicative of this type of Journal
    um if you go to sort of more like standard bread and butter types of journals
    like anything that's like Journal of like biomechanics Journal of blank um the
    the the the figures will generally look more like a real regular human made them
    rather than like a professional Graphics design team which in this case is what
    happens um

  text: so yeah and then um when I'm looking at a new paper uh I will look at the
    title I'll look at roughly speaking who wrote it like not the PE see if I recognize
    any names and kind of just look at where they're working um I'll read the abstract
    um and then I'll kind of skim the paper and look you know start out by just looking
    at the figures I typically like and by typically I will pretty much never just
    like sit down with a new paper and just read it from start to finish like it's
    a novel like that's just not how we tend to interrogate scientific papers usually
    it's it's kind of like jpeg compression like you do a you do skims at different
    levels and you kind of because you want to have the full picture and then you
    can sort of like choose to to sort of to Zone in um to different levels of analysis
    to different sort of parts of the paper um and science is a no clickbait situation
    so if we're if we're writing a good paper the title is a summary the abstract
    is a summary and then the paper itself will have sort of repetitive summaries
    within it um so so yeah so we're going to look at this this so this is figure
    one which will be referenced in the article somewhere yeah here so figure oh that's
    S1 so S1 is supplemental figure um but yeah so if you this even they're even they're
    citing figures which are not in the main article they're in this only you have
    to go to the supplemental information to get the get the results there um but
    this is the first one I'm seeing Figure 1 C represents this figure and the letter
    corresponds to this section here the figure will always have a caption the caption
    will always have a sort of one sentence summary of like what we're looking at
    here and then each lettered subsection will have some little write up of what's
    going on in that section um so yeah um yeah so this one is kind of doing uh like
    I said I think generally figure one should always be a methods figure and that
    you should also always or ideally have representative data this is doing both
    this is both a methods paper methods figure and a representation of Representative
    data okay so what were they actually doing here um so looking at stal Central
    pattern generators in mammals they're looking at it in rats specifically or they're
    using a rat as

  text: their model organism they don't they don't actually care about rats that much
    they're but they're using rats as a proxy animal that we believe has sufficient
    complexity that if we learn something about how supping Works in a rat that will
    be helpful in getting uh a treatment into humans and I happen to know that if
    you look at what this guy's been up to recently they have been able to apply this
    stuff in humans and I think they are actually like getting to the point of I don't
    know about like fully healing but I think they are restoring voluntary control
    of locomotion after a paralyzed spinal cord injury so I I haven't checked in on
    him in a couple like two or three years I guess so um but he's like he's like
    one of these like Mega people like they if you go to sfn he has like several rows
    that's just like a bunch of people that work in his lab because he just you know
    he's like the it's like a like a business owner type of thing so it's a very very
    different vibe if you have like a lab with 150 people in it versus if you have
    a lab like mine which has like three people in it so uh I don't want to run a
    lab like that that sounds terrible um so the idea was so they they they they took
    the M the rats and they yeah um so they took the the rats and they they gave them
    a surgical spinal cord injury they they went to in there and they they they gave
    them an injury that damaged their spine and severed all the fibers going to their
    brain so this is a picture of the central nervous system of a rat these are the
    two loads of the brain and then this is I'm not going to draw it uh but this is
    the spinal cord itself and the idea here this is kind of like the clever part
    is so this is the spine they didn't just cut straight across um they did two cuts
    one like 60% of the way through up here and then a little bit below it they cut
    it again going down there so all of the fibers that are going through here get
    severed but they're not just chopping it out so there is still a sort of a path
    hypothetically to go through so if it was possible for these fibers to kind of
    regrow and reform and reconnect to each other then you could theoretically have

  text: a signal coming from here and sort of like bypassing these injury points and
    getting back up to the brain um and so the idea was that they so this is and this
    is the process of sort of the decerebration part that's sort of similar to what
    they did in the Cat video um and literally it just you know they went in there
    and did surgery on these rats and went in with a little scalpel and cut them in
    certain areas and I'm sure if you go yeah adult threat received a left lateral
    over hem section at thoracic T vertebrae t7 and a right lateral hem section at
    T10 one of those things like if you knew what all those words meant then you would
    be able to say oh okay I understand all the details there over hem section means
    a little over half so they they didn't go to the halfway point they went over
    that um and so then what they do and so see if I can uh this on so now we put
    the mouse the rat mouse rat in this little robotic G entry system so this this
    is a uh there's other studies on this particular system but this is kind of the
    2012 version of that little wire wire uh support and treadmill thing from the
    cat um and so basically what they were able to do is it's like I think this is
    the best picture we're going to get in here and actually yeah I think well the
    almost certainly the supplemental information for the paper has many many things
    to say about this particular robotic system but basically it's like a kind of
    like a 3D printer if you ever seen that where it's kind of like a a a motor control
    that sort of moves over a 2d plane and then it sort of goes down to this kind
    of like supportive mechanism oh jeez and it supports the mouse of the Rat um partial
    body weight support so it's not it's not floating off the ground but it's also
    not holding its full body weight and and um and it allows it to turn and stuff
    like that while maintaining that body weight support so you know no matter what
    happens it's detecting what's going on and it's always making sure that the rat
    has you know 10 to 20% of its body weight on the ground the say and sure enough
    as we are sort of not surpris to learn um even after so this is the the

  text: activity also they they hold it upright so it walks in this kind of like bipedal
    way which is sort of would be cute if it wasn't so mob um and this is what intact
    means not chopped up um so the intact uh animal looks the the behavior looks like
    this so the trajectories in blue here are the trajectories of the feet um and
    this is all and they go here so we're not we are not shocked to learn that um
    even after uh yeah that even after this injury they can still walk decently okay
    like if you put them in a little robotic thing and drag them along they can walk
    just fine there's this complicated sort of like electrochemical thing that they
    put into their spine to make sure that the neurons are still sort of active and
    healthy and sort of firing hard enough to move the limbs um what they found with
    those cats is that even like the video you saw was probably right after that surgery
    was done but typically what happens is the behaviors kind of extinguish over time
    so like after a couple of hours or days or I think not more than not more than
    weeks um the cat would stop doing that behavior and if you put it back on the
    trebal would just kind of wind up dragging its feet um and so one of the results
    that they built on from their own labs building this sort of combination of like
    a pharmaceutical cocktail and a particular electrical stimulation pattern that
    allows them to keep the animals do like the deated animals doing this movement
    for a sort of arbitrary amount of time um and uh and yeah so that's I think that's
    the main that's the setup so we've got these we've got these they've been deated
    and they can do this sort of walking task and good for them um and so now here's
    where so that's all cool but none of it is shocking this is all stuff that we
    already knew when we showed the Cat video um so they're specific thing that they're
    trying to do is restore the animals ability to initiate walking um so a lot of
    this stuff is kind of like they're dragging it along like on a treadmill so it
    it gets this stimulus that it needs like the feet drag and they sort of pick then
    sensory signals pick up and they start taking steps um but that but the the rat
    cannot just sit there and just decide to start walking forward um so they're trying
    to restore that ability to do that and this is where there's a lot there's a lot
    going on here in terms of methodology that I'm not there's just too much depth
    to get into but I will say that they then they broke the animals up into two groups
    um one of the

  text: animals one of the groups of animals was getting the um the control condition
    I guess which was training so they they would they would do this surgery to them
    they would give them this Electro chemical prosthetic that allows them to sort
    of keep walking and then they would put them in this sort of robotic suit and
    they would have them do this like movement training so it take a bunch of steps
    in a bunch you know in a row um then the other group and this is where I think
    the main sort of like interesting nut of the paper comes in the other group would
    do a matched amount of training so a matched amount of steps but before they would
    start the robot thing pulling them forward they would put chocolate in front of
    their face and apparently rats like chocolate and so they put the chocolate in
    front of their face and the r goes oh I really want the chocolate and then the
    robot kind of pulls them forward and then they do the stepping behavior and then
    they get to eat the chocolate that was sort of presented to them so now we have
    two match groups of rats one is being trained and taking a bunch of steps with
    this robotic Gantry system the other is doing the exact same behaviors but they
    are being given a motivating a motivating food thing then they do the exact same
    steps and they receive the food as a reward for doing that and in the last 2 minutes
    of class if you sort of dig into all of this stuff what happens is that the animals
    that only do the base training don't get better and eventually they the behavior
    still becomes extinguished and they sort of they never regain that capacity the
    animals that get the chocolate reward experience this kind of regrowth pattern
    where they over enough time they see these connections getting formed that sort
    of bypass the injury site and over time they can put the chocolate in front of
    the the rat and the rat can actually initiate the stepping behavior before the
    robotic Gantry kind of pulls them forward and that is I think really amazing and
    the idea is that it Taps into the kind of the way that we that we move our bodies
    in the world it wasn't enough for the for the for the control rats to keep doing
    the stepping Behavior because it wasn't connected to anything in the world around
    it whereas the ones with the chocolate condition um they had the experience of
    oh there's a state there's something out there in the world that I want it's in
    front of me I need to walk to get it they start walking they don't know that they're
    being dragged by a robot and then as a result of that behavior they get to eat
    the chocolate and so when that happens it triggers this other concept of the dopamin
    neric reward system where basically basically the the brain gets flooded with
    this reward chemical that called dopamine and a bunch of other stuff that basically
- dur: 180.0
  end: 5580.0
  start: 5400.0
  text: has the the the effect of reinforcing all the neurons that were just firing
    just dup energic award system is kind of how that works and so it's that connection
    between that sort of that frontal area that volitional sort of prefrontal lobe
    cortex thing of I wish I was over there so I could eat the chocolate and then
    a bunch of neural fa activity happens then you get to eat the chocolate and then
    your brain gets flooded with neurons that say whatever was just happening reinforce
    that and then that is enough to trigger regrowth of neurons at the spinal level
    and that is as much as I'm going to say about this paper and uh end of class so
    thanks for following along and uh I'll see you all on Wednesday going to do two
    papers someday I'll learn I'll never learn
