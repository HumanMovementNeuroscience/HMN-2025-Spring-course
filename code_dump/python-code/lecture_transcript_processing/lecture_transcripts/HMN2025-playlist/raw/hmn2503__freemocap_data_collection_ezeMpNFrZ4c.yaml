full_transcript: okay hello everybody and welcome to Wednesday um so today is a very
  special day um because today we're going to do some data collection which is always
  a very exciting time in any scientist's life when you you you get some numbers you
  take some recordings and then often times you spend the next like while uh analyzing
  that data so how it goes matters a lot this is not a particularly High uh high stakes
  situation but yeah it'll be fun so we're going to do I'm going to try to like finish
  up what I was talking about last time and then I'm going to set up the cameras and
  uh do a quick recording do a couple of quick recordings with the free moap softare
  which I made with my lab over the past six years or so um and then if if all goes
  well it should pop something out that's worth looking at today um and then I will
  do some additional fiddling with it and I either have something to say about that
  on Monday or wait and give myself an extra bit of time and talk about that on Wednesday
  um so if you're not yeah your job is mostly to just sit and listen and try not to
  fall asleep but if you fall asleep I understand you're you got a lot going on um
  so Behold a human person it is roughly speaking this shape see uh this is a complicated
  shap but it's not nearly as complicated as this weird object um but if we needed
  to because we are finite beings with finite technology in finite time if we wanted
  to study this complicated object this the desidera of our research being to understand
  how humans move through the world eight um you have to make simplifications you
  have to make assumptions you have to do things like that and so last time I talked
  about can I do this that works so last time I talked about my personal favorite
  uh oversimplification of a complex physical object which is to take that object
  and reduce it down to a single point mass that we call the center of Mass center
  of mass we often hear it called like center of gravity um which in that term in
  that meaning uh gravity is sort of meant in like the old school sense of like density
  uh because density and mass are kind of the same thing in some conceptions um but
  the the beauty of the center mass is that it's a rather simple thing um the center
  of mass is the the concept of Center Mass is the thing that's the intuition that
  says that if I want to balance this stick on my finger I put my finger under two
  fingers under the midpoint of the the Total distribution of Mass on the thing and
  it balances there because there's the same amount of pull on this side as there
  is on that side and if it's a symmetric object the center of mass corresponds to
  the geometric center of the object itself if it is non that's the wrong direction
  oh I did that whoops um uh what am I trying to do I'm trying to do that if the weight
  is non-symmetrically um so linguistically it we tend to like interchange mass and
  weight language wise um in imperial units we actually don't have a dedicated measure
  for Mass we just use pounds which is actually a measure of weight weight is a measure
  of force it's like how much force am I putting into the ground so if you assume
  that gravity isn't changing mass and weight are interchangeable but just because
  I spent like an hour and a half last week for on Monday talking about SI units I
  should specify that when I say weight I typically mean mass in vice versa uh but
  until we go to the Moon that won't be a problem anyways Center of mass when the
  weight is non the mass is non uniformly distributed the center of mass is not going
  to be the same as the geometric center of the object but the same basic idea maintains
  like there is as much mass on this side of the base of support which is this as
  there is on that side and so the center of mass of the thing is right around here
  and so if I wanted to hold this object off of the ground sta I I need the base of
  support to be under the center of mass of the object itself if I put the center
  of base of support outside of the center of mass it'll fall in that direction which
  is not particularly mind-blowing but it is an app description of what balance is
  at a very s of low level of physics um have a let make sure we have enough time
  to sort of say all the things I want to say uh should be fine um so last time we
  also talked about any balls here I didn't bring me um when an object is flying through
  the air it has this nice ballistic trajectory which is caused by the transduction
  and exchange between kinetic and potential energy in a gravity well and there's
  MGH is potential energy 1 12 mv^ s is kinetic energy and even though this object
  is complicated in its form the trajectory that it takes in the air is exactly the
  same as it would be if if I was throwing an equivalent mass in a like if if this
  if you condense this down to like a single lead sphere and I toss it in the air
  it would follow the same trajectory if I spin it it spins around its Center of mass
  because it's in a when it's not when it doesn't have anything to push off against
  you don't have any there's nothing to react there no re no re no reaction force
  to push you in any direction things balance out and you get sort of simple predictable
  physical behavior um we also talked very briefly about one of my favorite things
  which is pendul pendulums pendulums pendul which this is an example of a pendulum
  you've seen them in various places of your life and it's basically a mass hanging
  below a standard pendulum is a mass hanging below a pivot point and if without you
  know if you pull it back and then let it go it'll swing back and forth for quite
  some time until friction bleeds off enough energy that it will eventually slow down
  and the reason for that sort of conservative motion is the same kind of transduction
  between potential and kinetic energy so if you imagine that's a pivot point that's
  the the Bob the mass of the pendulum let's assume that this string doesn't weigh
  anything or at the very least it weighs much much much less than this if we wanted
  to we could also just imagine that if it's shaped if this is the shape you know
  the center of mass of the thing is still going to be definable mathematically in
  some place there um but here it is up here and then we let it go it's it's up here
  at rest so it's kinetic energy equals zero and its potential energy is at let's
  just say it's Max and then so we let it go and it drops and then it gets to this
  point here where it's at the lowest point of its swing and at that point its potential
  energy is at its minimum because it's the lowest it's going to get you could even
  say the potential energy is zero if you want to talk about it that way um but its
  kinetic energy is going to be its maximum it's going to be moving the fastest it's
  going to move here after you drop it and then it's going to be moving so fast that
  it will have moment momentum because of that whole inertia thing that first law
  that will carry it up the other side of the Swing until it gets here and then again
  it will briefly pause kinetic velocity zero kinetic energy zero kinetic energy zero
  potential energy Max um and then it will then the same process repeats in reverse
  and as long as there's no way place that the energy can go it will continue like
  that forever in reality there's always going to be things like friction on points
  like this there's always going to be things like air resistance that will be bleeding
  off some of the energy so it will eventually if we if we plot it over time and we
  plot let's say this is the angle here Theta we want and we drop it from here it'll
  go like this and then it will slowly we call that damping out if it was a ideal
  system this would just be like a nice sine wave forever but because there's going
  to be some bleed due to friction this will be the nice trajectory there so that
  is a this is what a a standard hanging pendulum and look at it go pendula are very
  very very very important in the history of science they are sort of part of almost
  every important measurement in history um like gravitational constants you know
  Electro kolum Force um apparently there was a time when they used to use the period
  of a pendulum to do prospecting for iron ore because you can measure the D like
  the the period of a pendulum very very accurately and it's going to be defined by
  the density it's like the gravitational constant the gravitational force is a part
  of that uh equation of motion so apparently they would just like move these very
  very very precise pendula over parts of the ground where they thought there might
  be iron ore and then if they measured a change in the period that's an that's a
  reason to believe that there's a higher density in the column between you and the
  center of the earth this is I read about this in a book I had a hard time validating
  verifying that information but nonetheless it's very it's a pendula pendulums very
  good stuff um pendulums are also a nice example of like that periodic motion I mentioned
  briefly last time how we think about time there's like the the there's like stopwatch
  time which always counts up but then there's kind of like wall clock time that resets
  every so often and with something like an oscillator like this you sort of you're
  thinking in that phasic sort of like time you know goes from zero to some Maximum
  and then it like resets and then that's we call that a full cycle many many parts
  of biology ology have this kind of like phasic behavior um a lot of my research
  historically has been on Locomotion and that has a lot of pendulums in it um the
  main one that you would think about with the pendulum is like The Swinging leg um
  but there's another much more dramatic and Central pendulum which is the inverted
  pendulum of your sort of standing body so this is a pendulum hanging from a a central
  Pivot Point um but but you could lift this thing up until it's all the way on top
  and then have it be up here as an inverted pendulum and at this place uh so at the
  bottom here this is a stable point because if we just let it run this is where it
  will wind up this is in the language of dynamical systems um this is called an unstable
  point because technically speaking if you placed this here precisely at you know
  the angle of deflection equals zero this would stay it's it would sort of stand
  up in the same way that this marker stands up on the desk um but the reality but
  because this is an unstable point a any perturbation from to the left or the right
  is going to cause it like if you if this is not perfectly straight if it's a little
  bit off to the right right then gravity is going to pull it down and then it's going
  to keep pulling it down until it falls down there so you can balance a a p so you
  can hang a pendulum and it's passively stable gravity does all the work for you
  you don't have to worry about it um if you have if the pendulum has if the base
  of support has extent if it's nonzero base of support you can balance it happily
  on a flat surface and it will also stay there passively forever um but if it's if
  it's not then you can balance it you then the only way that you can balance it upright
  is if you are actively controlling it so this is the classic like boom broom trick
  where you can just like balance something on your hand and you can do it because
  I'm moving around the base of support to make sure that the that the whole thing
  never Falls over but I can't so this is all by way of preamble to the recordings
  we're about to do so if you think about in some idealized pendulum and this is the
  center of Mass on top of it uh remember we're spending a lot of time thinking about
  Force equals mass time acceleration um where this is the mass which we're assuming
  the mass doesn't change so we can sort of assume that Force equals acceleration
  some approximation um and so if you're you know in the idealized form you manag
  to standing up here if the projection of the center of mass onto the floor if the
  distance from that projection from this infimal base of support is zero then it'll
  be happily standing ight forever um if instead we're off by a little bit and the
  projection of the center of mass has a distance here from the base of support then
  in a very intuitive sense that gravity pulls things down Gravely pulling like that
  and then this distance there will be sort of P pushing the object away so that's
  why it's unstable because any deflection from zero and it will start to fall and
  the farther that it falls the more it gets pushed away so it'll be accelerating
  away from that sort of stable Point um and so if I'm if you're supporting it like
  the broom then you can make you can fix that by moving around the base of support
  on the ground um but if you yourself are the pendulum in question and you are you
  know imagine my center of mass is here and I'm standing on my one little leg if
  I I can um the only way that I can really have any control over where my body is
  is by the forces that I'm putting into the ground to my foot um so if we now imagine
  that's me that's my center of mass this joint here is the only place that I can
  push into the ground and so if I'm leaning a little bit too far forward I can push
  with my toe and push myself back if I'm lean a little too far back I can push with
  my heel not really I can I can lean forward I can do something to try to like change
  the forces to push myself in that direction but in in general if I'm not if I don't
  have monkey feet or grippers on my on the ground I can only really push so that
  means that my center of mass has to stay within this base of support range in order
  for me to be able to maintain standing posture without doing something dramatic
  like taking a step that's usually what we can do so if we're assuming that the task
  is to stand upright without taking a step the goal condition there is the center
  of mass stays within the base of support so that I can sort of move move around
  the force I'm pushing into the ground and sort of push my body back and forth to
  where it needs to go so that is balance and standing posture in a nutshell um all
  of this that we're doing here it falls under the category of biomechanics anytime
  you hear anyone talking about like forces and mechanics and Newton's laws and centers
  of mass and joints and cors and stuff like that you're you're hearing someone talk
  about biomechanics um but if you think about sort of like zoom out a little bit
  from those low-level physics and start thinking instead about the you know start
  thinking about the this physical object now as a biological system with a biological
  system with muscles and neurons and sensory systems and stuff like that um you can
  start trying to ask the questions from the sort of neuroscience perspective of how
  does all of that sort of play out in a a human person with things like joints and
  muscles and stuff like that so how do I if I'm if I'm because we're very very good
  at standing up this body configuration with the two feet and the arms that are that
  are off the ground this is wild in the animal kingdom this is a wild way to be musculos
  skeletally um pretty much all other mammals are quadrip heads um the only other
  bipeds out there are birds and most of them fly um the ground birds are arguably
  better bipeds than we are because they have like 450 million years of evolution
  on us so uh good for them but generally speaking like for Animals as big as we are
  to to support your entire body weight of off the ground with Just 2 feet is wacky
  it's like unpress ented there we really there's no other animals at least in the
  Maman Kingdom that have um bipedal locomotion kangaroos are a good example but they
  they can't really walk on two legs when they're when they're moving they can bounce
  on two legs but when they're when they're in place they sort of you know crawl around
  on four feet and they use their tails um animals like uh like bears and apes and
  stuff like that can walk on two feet but they tend to be they're knuckle Walkers
  um we are I believe I'm always like waiting to be find a counter example but at
  this point I should probably just accept that there aren't any uh we're like the
  only obligate bipeds in the Maman Kingdom where obligate bipad means like we really
  don't have like another option here like we it's bip or nothing um and we are also
  as far as they can figure out the only animal that has two of the main limbs of
  the sort of tetrapod this is tetrapod pod shape head two limbs on top two limbs
  on bottom and and a spine um we the only ones that have really well adapted upper
  limbs that have nothing to do with Locomotion um even ground Birds they have wings
  but they tend to kind of suck as appendages go um but we really we gave up a lot
  to have these like grabbing objects um and the cost was that we had now have to
  do this sort of gymnastics routine every time we want to get from point A to point
  B so thinking about this um like the neural bases of bipedalism and standing posture
  is one of those things that feels like kind of like a baser level of behavior than
  we tend to think about when we're thinking about the Majesty of human you know neuroscience
  and biology um but it's really fundamental and it's really core to like what we
  are as organisms and creatures so I think it's worth consideration here and and
  yeah yeah and so with that I think we can start transitioning towards like the data
  collection part of this so if we assume now that we all have the shared desire to
  understand how we weird bipedal humans manage to stand as effectively as we do stand
  upright and walk around as effectively as we do um we can start now trying to think
  of this as empirical scientists and start asking the question of if the if that
  is if the desired outcome the desera of our research Endeavors is to understand
  the neural bases of let's say just for Simplicity sake standing posture what are
  the measurements that we can take and what are the analyses that we can do and that
  that would give us insight into the underpinnings of that behavior um and there's
  lot of options um but we're going to do some simplified not some it's not even all
  that simplified but we're going to take um a full body perspective like you could
  go in and say oh well I want to figure out the sensitivity like how do we detect
  our lean angle like is it the vestibular organs in our inner ear is it the pressure
  under our foot is it the is it the the the proprioceptive forces and our ankles
  how can we measure the sensitivities of those things how can we sort of understand
  those circuits what are some other animals we can look at and you can do the kind
  of like the classic reductive um like biological stuff and start looking at like
  the the properties of of the muscles and we can you know cut up some cavers and
  see what's the density of of you know somata sensory organs in the bottom of the
  feet we can do that kind of like like zooming in on one part of the task um but
  necessarily doing that will leave out the actual behavior that we care about and
  what what we would would call the ecologically valid Behavior behavior of the organism
  in question performing the task that we care about in the real world or something
  close to the real world that you know is the if we assume we care about standing
  posture then we care about standing posture in the real world we don't care about
  standing posture in the lab in some weird artificial environment that we concocted
  so that we could have something that we could study um we might have to use that
  to be able to make any progress but secretly we we will feel a little bit sad because
  we will know that we have created an artificial representation of the thing in question
  and we are not actually studying the thing itself um so with that said yeah uh I
  won't go I won't do the whole Biz about this but also jumping exists we're going
  to course I'm jumping too jumping is kind of like this except instead of like leaning
  you're you're putting Force into the ground and if you put more Force into the ground
  then you weigh you'll leave the ground until you have bled off that additional energy
  and then you'll come back down and do something roughly equivalent to that uh yeah
  um yeah okay how do you feel about that so far emotionally prepared for what is
  to come great [Applause] so in a little bit here I have an hour and hour to go which
  there would be enough time uh spoiler alert I'm going to I'm going to set up some
  cameras and those cameras are going to allow us to record um full body 3D kinematic
  data of a human person standing in space this human person is me I would love to
  do a thing where we like record you guys and do that but like it just the time doesn't
  really work out um and so this weird confguration of cheap cameras and free software
  will will give us an approximation of my body uh at 30 frames per second down to
  some level of precision um at the centimeter scale of precision for my joints and
  the approximation will be roughly equivalent to this it will tell me roughly where
  my head was where each body segment was where each joint was and this will be kind
  of like the this is the data model that will come out of it um and this is where
  I'm going to start thinking as we go uh and I'm going to record myself doing a couple
  of behaviors so the first thing I'm going to do is calibrate because I have to do
  that and I'll tell you about talk about that as it goes um then I'm going to do
  a standing task so I'm going to stand on two feet then I'm going to stand on one
  foot and then I'm going to stand on the other foot and then we're going to probably
  I'll ask someone to pull out a timer we do like 20 30 seconds of standing in each
  each one so this will be recording one this will be recording two uh sorry 0 1 and
  then two I'm going to do the same thing doing this different than I've done the
  past years but I'm going to do the same thing except now I'm going to do the same
  thing while holding on to a chair so I'll like so I'll start out doing just like
  freestanding and then next time I'll like lean over and like have my hand on the
  desk and sort of do the same kinds of tasks um then after that I'm going to do I'm
  going to take a couple big jumps just jump standing jump as high as I can jump uh
  and then we'll do another one where I'll do like I'll jump in place for like 30
  seconds and then at that point that'll be enough recordings um so that yeah so we're
  going to so this will be so we'll get 1 2 3 four five total recordings which should
  process in the moment depending on how fast how long it takes set up I may or may
  not truncate the processing so that we can get through them all um but the your
  task as you're watching the the show um is just kind of think about these behaviors
  and think about them relative to the kind of the the biomechanic Center of mass
  types of uh of conversations we've been having so far and just make some predictions
  about what these data will look like um and you could think about it at like the
  full joint level like you know down to the level of like knees and ankles and shoulders
  and stuff like that um but that can be a little overwhelming so I would also recommend
  thinking about it just in terms of like if you boiled this whole thing down to just
  a ground plane a foot and a leg and then a center of mass what would you expect
  to see like what's going to be the difference between like standing on two legs
  versus standing on one leg what's gonna be the difference between standing on one
  leg free versus standing one leg while like leaning on a table uh what's it going
  to look like when I take a big jump like what's it going to look like when I take
  a bunch of jumps um and yeah think about it oo make some predictions uh because
  there's your ability to make predictions about what this is going to go is how you
  know that you're operating within a theoretical framework they're thinking about
  there is an assumption that I am making that boiling down the this hyper complex
  object into a singular 3D Point Mass and and and saying I we'll be able to say things
  about that we'll be able to predict the motion of that point mass and say things
  about that point mass that will tell us things about that the global organism um
  that's a that's a theoretical framework that's a strong bold claim um but we're
  going to operate within that space and yeah I'm going to try to do this without
  crashing my computer too uh which is always fun so great has anybody here worked
  anywhere near motion capture before any like physical therapy or anything like that
  no yeah so it's one of these things where motion capture like mostly where you will
  have seen it will be like behind the scenes and of movies and video games and stuff
  like that um you know a lot of like Lord of the Rings stuff of Golem and smile run
  running around um all right uh but it has been around and used to study human movement
  for quite some time um arguably video like the invention of video uh was technically
  what am I doing here that I got that I have this this yes um and then this so the
  original like video was created to study horses in motion based off a a barbat uh
  from Vanderbilt the guy like the robber bearing um about whether or not horses ever
  was there was ever a point in their Gallop with they at all fourt off the ground
  so you've probably seen the picture of like this like a bunch of horses old timey
  video um basically to solve that bet uh Vanderbilt commissioned a photographer to
  like take a bunch of sequential videos of pictures of a horse in full gallop and
  was able to show that there is in fact a phase where they're all off the ground
  where the feet are all off the ground um but in since then motion capture has been
  used in the study of human movement and clinical stuff um for as long as we've been
  doing that what am I doing doing this okay uh but also traditionally it's it's not
  a very common thing to do because it's very very expensive um the motion capture
  lab I have in Richards invol has like A4 million dollar worth of motion capture
  equipment in it and it's in a a room that was specifically built for the purpose
  of doing motion capture and it's you know it's a very good system it's very very
  precise but it's also a huge pain it to use and it's just it's expensive so the
  the you know there's the the number of people out there who are studying human movement
  is much much larger than the number of people can who can afford motion capture
  so that was kind of a part of the motivation that I had for making this strange
  system um was basically realizing around 2017 when a software came out called uh
  open pose that used convolutional neural networks to basically draw a stick figure
  on a person in a video and I saw that and then sometime later realized that that
  capacity to basically draw like a 2d skeleton estimate on a person in a scene was
  kind of enough to build a motion capture system out of um and then you know that
  was sort of an idea that I had and sort of the thought was yeah that's a cool idea
  but like I don't know how to write code and that seems like way too much work so
  I guess I'll never do it and then three years later Co hit and I lost access to
  my lab for an undef period of time and I also lost faith in the academic system
  uh pretty much entirely and started like rethinking the idea that using I'm going
  to have to unplug this camera now um sure I'll turn you off later um yeah I I kind
  of I started to really doubt the core principle of science which is that the best
  thing that we can do as scientist is to publish papers in esoteric journals that
  exploit us for profit um and started thinking about like you know is this Behavior
  actually making the world a better place and started had the uncomfortable realization
  that like I don't really think it does like I think it's a good thing to do I think
  that you know scientists are generally trying to like improve the world um but we're
  trapped in these systems of of communication that just like it just doesn't serve
  like it it made sense in the 1800s it just doesn't make sense now so I personally
  transitioned away from publishing papers and journals and towards using the skills
  and understandings that I have from my sort of history of scientific research to
  build tools that people can actually use in their real lives uh so this is one of
  them um so real quick if you want to look it up Freo cap just Google Freo cap you'll
  find it freeo cap it's pretty oh I'm not on the internet am I on the internet I
  am on the internet yeah um hey look people make videos about me uh but yeah you
  can look it up it was a whole it's been a whole process um and let's get to it so
  so free mo cap stands for free motion capture it is a markless motion capture system
  the majority of like traditional motion capture you wind up you wear the spandex
  with the suits and the reflective dots this is markerless so the idea is to use
  sort of like the modern sort of uh what's the word the the arising technology of
  just like computer vision and sort of like the wacky stuff we can do with that to
  to play the role that the markers used to play in traditional motion capture systems
  um let's talk a little bit more what that means I'm actually doing it um just go
  uh the hardest part of making this process the most sophisticated part of The Code
  by by a mile is the part that connects to the cameras um maybe it shouldn't have
  been as surprising do this yeah I think that makes sense um so everything is Skelly
  skelly's the logo it's like a skeleton you see it's like you know kind of how it
  works uh my personal Journey as a researcher I was a philosopher I got a bachelor
  degree in philosophy then I started doing more perceptual motor neuroscience and
  kind of like was studying vision from like a vision science perspective um and was
  feeling not it felt insufficient it felt like incomplete and it wasn't until I started
  digging into I started like found my way into some of the more biomechanics approach
  to movement um that because I was studying visually guided Locomotion in an environment
  that really didn't have any consideration of like the physics of being an object
  moving through space um and when I started reading the biomechanics papers was when
  it a lot of things started to click for me and those papers had a bunch of skeletons
  in it calm it down guys um and that's why there's skeletons everywhere just because
  it's sort of like this it's like kind of a joke that I studi Neuroscience from the
  perspective of a skeleton because that's like physics wise it's mostly skeleton
  the neural components are really not not really Newton doesn't really notice the
  Neuroscience parts of it he mostly notices the skeleton anyway anyway um so so this
  is the latest form of the software um actually it's not uh the the main so the current
  stage of development of free moap is that the the the core software is a little
  bit behind the development side of it so we're using the this camera stuff it's
  very slow for some reason why are we so slow okay there we go oh right I have to
  turn you off over here okay apologies to oh I guess we can do that so uh turn you
  off okay there you go um let me shut you down me again so this is one of those places
  where like all the stuff streaming by is where all the work went and then the outside
  is quite simple in comparison um reasonably confident that this will work but anytime
  oh wait that's still okay hopefully that should work better we can hope yeah so
  as a scientific tool um motion capture is in the very uh crowded space of being
  a camera based research tool so the environmental energy that we are encoding and
  recording in this case will be light so light bounces off of me bounces goes through
  the lens of the camera gets absorbed by the camera sensor which is just a little
  rectangular silicone wafer silicon wafer whatever whichever one of those is accurate
  um and yeah and then we will be recording the we will be pulling samples from a
  light cone from three different locations in space um 30 times per second uh and
  there's been a lot like a lot a lot like years of my life has been spent uh making
  sure that the videos that get recorded from these cameras are uh synchronous so
  as these cameras are pulling as each camera is sort of pulling uh you know frames
  from its field of view um there's a lot of code under the hood that's making sure
  that each camera is pulling at close to the same time as the others as possible
  so we're pulling syn Eyes videos so we talked about the mentioned last time the
  sort of the concept of like spatio temporal calibration to in recording and sort
  of that just like the spatial components and the temporal components great the temporal
  components here are handled by the software so we are going to assume that all the
  the samples from each camera are synchronized in time to some approximation um so
  the second part of that is the spatial so let's see so those are all rotated are
  they rotated the same way they are which is counterclockwise I think that should
  work did I get that right I got it backwards it's always backwards yeah we here
  okay good um yeah great so it's not using the space particularly well but don't
  worry about that so this is so now I'm going to point the cameras so I'm going to
  stand right here and so I'm going to try to point the cameras that they can all
  get a good view of that spot all right oh I have that one that's nice we also have
  that that's nice okay now unfortunately I am I am going to I'll do that later um
  so the images are a little dark I think that is the the nature of the Beast another
  part of the of the game here with Freo cap was building the cheapest possible system
  I could possibly get so intentionally targeting like garbage cameras these are really
  garbage cameras like they cost $10 is a pop um on the assumption that you know as
  a researcher buying four GoPros is nothing but if I'm trying to make something that's
  accessible to the world uh GoPros are expensive um so trying to build it on the
  cheapest possible Hardware was a part of the game um okay so we're going to have
  to do uh some projective geometry at some point so I mentioned that we have the
  temporal synchronization happening through the software um but we are also going
  to need to know the position of each of these cameras in space we're going to specifically
  need to know the six degree of Freedom position so XYZ location then XYZ rotation
  so six total numbers six degrees of freedom um and the way we're going to do that
  is by way of a calibration routine um that involves a calibration object um this
  is called a Cho these little markers here are called Aro markers and this is a calibration
  object which many um you know SC every scientific tool will have some calibration
  component to it and the typical pattern for calibration is you're use you use the
  system to measure something that you know the answer to I'm going to use this to
  measure the position of these Corners in the board because I know that these Corners
  are all 58 mm apart like I know that these blast squares are 58 millim wide so if
  I use this system and I record this shape I know what the right answer is so if
  I if I record the position of the board and I check the numbers and it says yeah
  these are 58 mm apart then I now have some confidence that the system is working
  as intended and now I can use it to measure the unknown thing which is the body
  in space that I'm not going to have any other additional measurement and insight
  about um so every form of scientific research is going to involve calibration at
  some point in some cases that calibration is done at the factory when they're where
  they make the tool um but in this kind of like more hacky DIY world we uh we make
  do with our own stuff okay how we doing on timeing okay on time all right so recording
  so basically what this looks like is I take the board and I show it to the cameras
  and I make sure that each camera has shared views so in this case they can all see
  it at the same time um oh I'm going to need to turn that off actually uh all right
  you can look here but I have to turn this off because there's too much light I I
  was you got to be careful with the light so uh you can look there if you need to
  um so basically the board the cameras can see the board they have shared views of
  the board um so they can you can do the kind of the the the actually not so simple
  math of if I am camera a and I can see the board from this angle and at the same
  time camera B can see the board and I see it from this angle then camera a must
  be in this position relative to camera B and vice versa um make sure that works
  usually when I do this part of the class I bring my grad student in to help me out
  and this time he was busy so I was like I can do it all on my own and I can do it
  all on my own but it is definitely one of the cases I was like I sure wish Aaron
  was here it'd be nice to have an additional nervous system doing this stuff uh so
  now I'm just manually moving stuff from one folder to another just because of the
  stage of software it's in um PR what we doing uh you going to run you going to crash
  did I learn picture anyone ah UV sync okay we may also another traditional so I
  tested a lot of this but I didn't I'm realizing now I didn't test like every part
  of it um so we might find ourselves having a little bit more running on trust that
  I would have preferred okay well as that runs um let's see what are you doing why
  okay calling the audible so well remember how so uh I will have to process these
  offline because it's not set up and I don't have the brain space to do the online
  debugging so this will be a lot more prediction than usual just usually I can make
  this happen in the same time um but but for now so we've done calibration now we're
  going to do simple standing so twoot standing one foot and one foot on the left
  one foot on the right um we would call this a control condition because this is
  the one where we're not there's nothing will be manipulated in this case um and
  then we're going to do this sort of manipulation condition which is going to be
  very similar to this but with this sort of sort of extra factor of I will be supporting
  myself on a chair or a table or something like that and your I guess I can use this
  yeah it's that um and then we'll do the jumping stuff so for you know yeah and we're
  not going to be getting uh we're not going to be getting real time output from this
  this class unfortunately but that just means that the your mental model of prediction
  must work across times okay now I unfortunately have to take my shoes off which
  is fine but I just always feel weird doing it um the main reason if I had been smart
  I would have at least worn lightly colored socks um but you can see how dark the
  ground is and you just can't see my feet relative to the ground so I will Tom soyer
  up my feet now you can't um this is one of the in a real recording I would be like
  I'd have lights and stuff like that um it's also one of these cases where like it
  tends to work best like outside in the sun because the sun is very very bright um
  yeah there you go now you can see my feet um still a bit dark still very dark that
  one's good okay so one and two are a little dark manual oh it looks better on my
  screen okay okay so can I have someone can I request a a stopwatch person thank
  you uh so I'm going to ask for like basically 30 second intervals um so I'll let
  you know when it's ready to go um I do have to turn this off again and I'll leave
  that down and all right where is the and I want to be standing like here great all
  right uh I'll let you know it's not right now so here we go so I'm going to stand
  here and I guess yeah start it now so this is me standing uh I'm kind of already
  bored with this so I'm going to lean I'm going to be sort of intentionally in all
  these cases leaning as far as I can lean sort of within ideally without moving my
  feet um so I'm leaning all the way to the right and all the way forward uh let me
  know when we hit 30 there cool no great okay so now I'm on one foot and my Bas of
  support has now gotten appreciably smaller and I'm wiggling around both for fun
  and because I'm off balance um so again sort of like just look at like what's happening
  bodily I'm doing a lot of movement but we have some strong predictions we can make
  about the position of my center of mass relative to my Bas of support and you make
  those preditions even stronger thank you um and Y uh when the base of support gets
  smaller your ability to predict the location of the center of Mass gets better like
  you have more predictive capacity because it is a more constrained task there are
  fewer ways that I can successfully complete the task of standing upright when I
  only have one foot on the ground than I do when I have two feet on the ground and
  and done [Applause] okay great so with those predictions in mind um how am I going
  to do this I think I will yeah that works great this is my now my standing stick
  um so same thing uh sorry I your name stopwatch friend stopwatch friend what's your
  name isab Isabelle thank you uh same thing now for the let's say let's call this
  a support condition we're now going to be using like a stick to support myself um
  outside of my biologically prescribed base of support so we go over here and I will
  stand for a little bit so just go ahead and start the timer whenever this is just
  kind of calibration purposes and then now uh I'm going to do the same kind of task
  of Leaning as far as I can relative to my base of support except now I have this
  stick to sort of assist me so with the knowledge and theoretical models of human
  body that you are armed with like how do you think this is going to change that
  data um so now I'm going to go onto my right foot similarly playing all over the
  place and let's assume for like when we get this data back you're not going to the
  stick is not going to be in the data uh we will know that it was there and we'll
  know that this hand is is mounted to the ground um but if you think about what the
  data will look like you can have some predictions there and now we switch feet and
  so again just like think about it what what do you think would be different here
  it's been a long day it's like standing in place is not the hardest thing in the
  world but I'm making it difficult and okay cool okay thank you Isabelle um H this
  next part I hope I don't I hope I don't die on camera but if I do just analyze the
  data okay okay um so for this one I am going to record I'll say three because that's
  what I wrote uh but this is going to be standing high jump so I'm going to try to
  jump as high as I can from a standing place and again think about think about what
  that will look like think about what it will look like at this level think about
  what's happening at the physics level where is the force coming from what when it
  where is it coming from at the the start where is it going at the end what's happening
  in the middle um what could be measured what could be inferred what additional data
  will you wish you had um and if I break anything you know you can have questions
  about that okay uh I don't need a timer for this so record so it goes in here hello
  I don't want to whack myself there God I used to I used not weigh as much okay and
  and that's all the knees I have today I ask do a little bit more okay so big jumps
  discreet jumps pauses in the middle lot of arm swinging and knee torquing this big
  hip joint doing its thing and some amount of air time some amount of cheating in
  the air time oo uh okay um see this going to stay on when I do this next part if
  it does probably this will be more probably be more reliable uh okay okay so now
  instead of doing sub veral discreet high jumps I'm just going to bounce in place
  uh and I'll bounce in place for as long as I want to which I'm not going to ask
  anyone to time it I'm just going to go until I want to stop may do at least 10 and
  then I'll just go until I'm tired and I'm already tired so we'll see how that goes
  oh also pointing out I pulled my legs up I pulled the pants up both to expose the
  nice pale skin below which does well this feels bright to us but our eyes um the
  human eye is incredibly good at adjusting to changes in luminance so relative to
  like a sunny day it's basically Pitch Black in here and we're just really really
  good at adapting to that um but so I exposed my legs both because they are lighter
  and they are contrasting with the carpet but I'm also trying to give the cameras
  a view of my knee um as opposed to having it be blocked again like if you're trying
  if you're trying to predict where my knee is it's going to be way harder if it's
  being covered by cloth than it is if it's directly exposed so it's not just a fashion
  statement it's empirically grounded okay so yeah so we'll say we'll call this discret
  jumps and we'll call this repeated Hops and boun so again thinking about the behavior
  thinking about the mechanics thinking about the joint torqus thinking about the
  fatigue where does the energy come from what did I have for dinner last night these
  are the questions of biology okay I'm not going to drop time it okay so record standing
  here give that nice calibration of and now we hop okay one 2 3 oh my God there's
  just so many people looking at me it's fine also I wonder there like are there people
  below us are they wondering what's happening I don't know how long have I been jumping
  how many jumps was that I don't know okay I think I think that's playing 10 more
  okay one two three four five six 7even 8 nine 10 okay done okay great data collected
  not processed um okay um let me see if I can get this thing running I'll give it
  one one more College try as they say oh I need to get myself enough time to clean
  up too okay good all righty so let's see so UV V not that's to look like dot V come
  on do this from a terminal V uh dot V scrips activate EV sync punch that and free
  mo cap there SK oh Skelly cam damn it do scripts activate you sync and REM cap huh
  huh huh huh oh right you can't see anything sorry sort of the fundamental nature
  of working on anything for any length of time particularly if the thing you're making
  is something that other people are using uh the version of the thing that other
  that the people are using is the version that you are like ashamed of because like
  I the code for this I wrote years ago I've learned so much since then that when
  I look at this I'm like oh my God I'm so sorry to the world for what I've done to
  it okay so this is freemo Cap this is the core software um then if I do that I click
  on that say set active recording yes yes run calibration from active recording run
  calibration okay so we're now running calibration data um and it's going through
  I can put my shoes on at least um it's going through and uh detecting the boards
  in the screen um it'll take a little bit of time but at this point I think we should
  be able to get like we'll be able to look at something by the end of but before
  the end of the day which will be good does anyone have any burning questions while
  we're while the thing is running it's one of those things like I'm sure there are
  many questions so does can anyone choose one question from the many that are floating
  around I also made a mistake because I was like talking during this calibration
  thing so I was like doing it and at some point I was like blah blah blah and then
  so it's longer than it needs to be uh which is rookie mistake this is the code that
  I am like currently rewriting like I'm currently uh rebuilding the calibration part
  of it which will allow it to do much more it'll be faster okay um I guess I could
  look at the other stuff but I don't really want to do that that feels like cheating
  like I have recordings from the past but that's that feels like cheating right now
  um yeah H okay yes okay now this stuff is going through yeah great so now now now
  you have this object should I can't write now for some reason so camera 0o camera
  1 camera 2 camera Matrix and then these are the two points that matter rotation
  1 2 3 translation 1 2 3 camera one is defined to zero so these are the six degrees
  of freedom that we need for each of the cameras so we now know where all the cameras
  are these are measured in millimeters and theoretically you know 1 and 1/2 so 1
  1500 mm is like 1 and 1/2 m th M so they say that they're you know meter to two
  apart which checks out intuitively so now that we have that uh we can okay I think
  let's look at the jump the big jump that's the most fun one I think so that was
  the actually yeah oh it's kind of off screen there but we'll see how that goes uh
  set is active recording okay these most recent calibration and that probably the
  shortest too so go ahead and process okay okay so if all goes well do you see my
  blender you do see my blender great so now what it's doing is it's going through
  and in each of the videos it's going through frame by frame um so let say if it's
  a you know a thousand frames of recording which is you know whatever 30 seconds
  or something less than 30 seconds actually um then for three cameras you have 3,000
  total images and then in each of those images you have to run through and do the
  relatively heavy computation of using the convolutional neural network to try to
  detect where the person is in the screen uh in the recording and that will look
  oh actually that's from old okay never mind um yeah and so then once you have done
  that you will have 3,00 two-dimensional estimates of where I was in space coupled
  with estimates for where each of the cameras were in space and so you can do don't
  worry about that that's normal um you from so from the the two-dimensional estimates
  in the images plus the six degree of Freedom positions of the cameras you can triangulate
  the position of each of those point points by basically just imagining firing a
  laser so like tracking my elbow from camera 1 2 and three if you imagine you fired
  a laser from each of those cameras the place where the lasers cross over each other
  is the position of that object in space um and all of that is going to happen under
  the hood very very fast and it's all just a bunch of like like that kind of geometry
  hasn't changed in like a thousand years it's the same stuff that that's like uclid
  level geometry it's just now being done much much much faster on a strange rectangle
  of silicone and electricity um but yeah once this pink line oh are we still running
  oh good we can actually yeah so it looks roughly like that so this is the output
  from one of the videos so this is so from the perspective of I guess that camera
  this was the location of my right shoulder that's the left shoulder there's a bunch
  of points on my face these are hips ankles toes basically tagging all the joint
  centers in two-dimensional image coordinates um which we can and so yeah so that's
  all well and good it's useful information but you would have a very difficult time
  doing any of the the because you don't really have a measurement in this case of
  like where the ground is like you don't really have a measurement of what up is
  you have up in the image but you can see that the image is tilted so if you're want
  to say oh you're moving relative to gravity like if you want to say your balance
  over your feet those are all terms that happen in the reference frame of like the
  physics we said we call it the inertial reference frame um and this data is all
  coming in in camera sensor reference frame this is 0 in image coordinates just the
  upper left point of the screen and that's 0 meaning the upper left corner of the
  little silicone wafer the at the back of the camera thing um so converting that
  into something that is it's very strange that that one is like running so much slower
  than the others um but to be able to be able to talk about this data in sort of
  these physically grounded terms that we've been trying to sort of build up uh requires
  a transfer and sort of a lot of computation to sort of to get this data referenced
  in a inertial reference frame okay what is going on okay cool um so now the pink
  lines are gone which means we've done all the 2D estimation and this white much
  much faster line is doing all of the triangulation so so uh 550,000 data points
  uh just cranking yeah and now how we going doing that recording data this takes
  a s now okay yeah it's now saving stuff down to disk and now it will with any luck
  start cranking yeah come on buddy yeah yes and so now this this part of the code
  is now sending so at this point we've we've we've we've done the main task we've
  recorded the PE the person we've done the two-dimensional thing the 3D reconstruction
  has actually already happened um and now a very important often neglected step is
  occurring which is converting it into a human into some visualizable format so something
  that we as humans can look at and make sense of because saving all the data out
  until like a massive CSV Excel spreadsheet is good but like it's still not a a term
  that we can really make any sense out of so or a format that we can make sense out
  of so this is blender which is a 3D animation software and this is where we see
  if it actually worked well which I feel let's see how it does so I'm not in the
  screen there we go here I am it's okay so this one is not looking the best so you
  see this one it's um the image is upside down is it going to it's going to fix oh
  man there we go so that was actually a nice uh case where this is a good view this
  is a good view this one it's seeing the skeleton upside down uh so this reconstructive
  view is not going to look right because a third of the data is flipped upside down
  and luckily I took a few steps forward and then it fixed itself and so now this
  is a much better looking skeleton um see time go can't time so now that I know it
  works I can blame the point um it's a little bit rotated which I can fix later so
  rotate around X there you go um this pink and blue ball here is the calculated Center
  of mass um the skeleton is sort of more for visualization than actual data um this
  these stick figures here those are the rigid bodies that I was talking about so
  this is the the thigh the upper arm things like that and cool yeah great and so
  now okay so it's not the best data I've ever gotten in my life it's just very dark
  in here um um but it's not bad and if I look oops so that is the trajectory of my
  center of mass in the Z coordinate so the ground plane we're going to call XY up
  is z um and yeah and so this is a Time series plot we talked about these last time
  so the x axis is time and then the Y AIS is whatever the the Z value that is the
  height that's the height of my center of mass above the ground and if you recall
  so if gravity didn't change my mass didn't change so that means the height tells
  you my potential energy uh if we assume that this is where I'm this is my standing
  height we can call that zero if we want to that's zero potential energy and then
  here we see something interesting happening so before I you've seen this several
  times now I do got to stop and we're going to talk about this at length next time
  um but just imagine at like my center of mass level like we have some guess about
  what this Behavior corres responds to um so think about what is this dip what is
  this peak and what is this dip again and oops wish I didn't do that come on there
  we go so there we go that's my lowest point skeleton's kind of screwy uh just because
  it's a weird View and I'm kind of off screen here um but going to go up and that's
  the peak that's the apex of the jump that's the highest this is the place my my
  potential energy is at its highest and my kinetic energy in the in the Z position
  is zero I'm I am paused at that height um and now I'm coming back down and again
  the the the data is not the best in the world but you can see that kind of I don't
  just land with like straight legs I land and I bend into it there's intuitive reasons
  why but then there's also like deeper biomechanical and biopys and physiological
  reasons why why this is a lot of energy I have to bleed off and I don't want to
  Bleed It Off directly into my joints I would rather bleed it off into my soft tissue
  and let the muscles kind of pull against it so that I don't blow out my Meniscus
  or something like that um and then I do it again and so this is also kind of a nice
  example of why the center of mass is such a nice measurement because even in these
  cases where the data is not that great and the skeleton gets all wble garble in
  these in these particular moments the overall trajectory is roughly speaking what
  you would expect it to be so even in context where the data has you know Fidelity
  issues uh you can still talk about the global data because it's basically a giant
  smoothing algorithm to just collapse this entire thing down to a singular point
  we uh and then I really I I got to go but I can't help myself uh in range around
  frame 3030 calculate the whole thing okay let play so that is is the frame by frame
  measurement of it you can see this the 3D trajectory oh why did it go oh it's not
  doing the whole path oh cuz it's much longer than that uh dat paths all paths there
  you go and here we can even take the whole guy hide him hide him so that is the
  mechanical estimate of the global Behavior okay I will take my time I'll I'll clean
  this up um and think about think about the things we talk about make some general
  predictions um I'm going to make an assignment for y'all for next uh for the next
  for next week about talking to the bot about predictions around this data stuff
  and also about just like the concept of units and measurements and how it applies
  to your particular domain of inquiry um but just you know chew on it with your brain

  text: okay hello everybody and welcome to Wednesday um so today is a very special
    day um because today we're going to do some data collection which is always a
    very exciting time in any scientist's life when you you you get some numbers you
    take some recordings and then often times you spend the next like while uh analyzing
    that data so how it goes matters a lot this is not a particularly High uh high
    stakes situation but yeah it'll be fun so we're going to do I'm going to try to
    like finish up what I was talking about last time and then I'm going to set up
    the cameras and uh do a quick recording do a couple of quick recordings with the
    free moap softare which I made with my lab over the past six years or so um and
    then if if all goes well it should pop something out that's worth looking at today
    um and then I will do some additional fiddling with it and I either have something
    to say about that on Monday or wait and give myself an extra bit of time and talk
    about that on Wednesday um so if you're not yeah your job is mostly to just sit
    and listen and try not to fall asleep but if you fall asleep I understand you're
    you got a lot going on um so Behold a human person it is roughly speaking this
    shape see uh this is a complicated shap but it's not nearly as complicated as
    this weird object um but if we needed to because we are finite beings with finite
    technology in finite time if we wanted to study this complicated object this the
    desidera of our research being to understand how humans move through the world
    eight um you have to make simplifications you have to make assumptions you have
    to do things like that and so last time I talked about can I do this that works
    so last time I talked about my personal favorite uh oversimplification of a complex
    physical object which is to take that object and reduce it down to a single point
    mass that we call the center of Mass center of mass we often hear it called like
    center of gravity um which in that term in that meaning

  text: uh gravity is sort of meant in like the old school sense of like density uh
    because density and mass are kind of the same thing in some conceptions um but
    the the beauty of the center mass is that it's a rather simple thing um the center
    of mass is the the concept of Center Mass is the thing that's the intuition that
    says that if I want to balance this stick on my finger I put my finger under two
    fingers under the midpoint of the the Total distribution of Mass on the thing
    and it balances there because there's the same amount of pull on this side as
    there is on that side and if it's a symmetric object the center of mass corresponds
    to the geometric center of the object itself if it is non that's the wrong direction
    oh I did that whoops um uh what am I trying to do I'm trying to do that if the
    weight is non-symmetrically um so linguistically it we tend to like interchange
    mass and weight language wise um in imperial units we actually don't have a dedicated
    measure for Mass we just use pounds which is actually a measure of weight weight
    is a measure of force it's like how much force am I putting into the ground so
    if you assume that gravity isn't changing mass and weight are interchangeable
    but just because I spent like an hour and a half last week for on Monday talking
    about SI units I should specify that when I say weight I typically mean mass in
    vice versa uh but until we go to the Moon that won't be a problem anyways Center
    of mass when the weight is non the mass is non uniformly distributed the center
    of mass is not going to be the same as the geometric center of the object but
    the same basic idea maintains like there is as much mass on this side of the base
    of support which is this as there is on that side and so the center of mass of
    the thing is right around here and so if I wanted to hold this object off of the
    ground sta I I need the base of support to be under the center of mass of the
    object itself if I put the center of base of support outside of the center of
    mass it'll fall in that direction which is not particularly mind-blowing but it
    is an app description of what balance is at a very s of low level of physics um
    have a let make sure we have enough time to sort of say all the things I want
    to say uh should be fine um so last time we also talked about any balls here I
    didn't bring me um when an object is flying through the air it has this nice ballistic

    energy in a gravity well and there's MGH is potential energy 1 12 mv^ s is kinetic
    energy and even though this object is complicated in its form the trajectory that
    it takes in the air is exactly the same as it would be if if I was throwing an
    equivalent mass in a like if if this if you condense this down to like a single
    lead sphere and I toss it in the air it would follow the same trajectory if I
    spin it it spins around its Center of mass because it's in a when it's not when
    it doesn't have anything to push off against you don't have any there's nothing
    to react there no re no re no reaction force to push you in any direction things
    balance out and you get sort of simple predictable physical behavior um we also
    talked very briefly about one of my favorite things which is pendul pendulums
    pendulums pendul which this is an example of a pendulum you've seen them in various
    places of your life and it's basically a mass hanging below a standard pendulum
    is a mass hanging below a pivot point and if without you know if you pull it back
    and then let it go it'll swing back and forth for quite some time until friction
    bleeds off enough energy that it will eventually slow down and the reason for
    that sort of conservative motion is the same kind of transduction between potential
    and kinetic energy so if you imagine that's a pivot point that's the the Bob the
    mass of the pendulum let's assume that this string doesn't weigh anything or at
    the very least it weighs much much much less than this if we wanted to we could
    also just imagine that if it's shaped if this is the shape you know the center
    of mass of the thing is still going to be definable mathematically in some place
    there um but here it is up here and then we let it go it's it's up here at rest
    so it's kinetic energy equals zero and its potential energy is at let's just say
    it's Max and then so we let it go and it drops and then it gets to this point
    here where it's at the lowest point of its swing and at that point its potential
    energy is at its minimum because it's the lowest it's going to get you could even
    say the potential energy is zero if you want to talk about it that way um but
    its kinetic energy is going to be its maximum it's going to be moving the fastest
    it's going to move here after you drop it and then it's going to be moving so
    fast that it will have moment momentum because of that whole inertia

    it gets here and then again it will briefly pause kinetic velocity zero kinetic
    energy zero kinetic energy zero potential energy Max um and then it will then
    the same process repeats in reverse and as long as there's no way place that the
    energy can go it will continue like that forever in reality there's always going
    to be things like friction on points like this there's always going to be things
    like air resistance that will be bleeding off some of the energy so it will eventually
    if we if we plot it over time and we plot let's say this is the angle here Theta
    we want and we drop it from here it'll go like this and then it will slowly we
    call that damping out if it was a ideal system this would just be like a nice
    sine wave forever but because there's going to be some bleed due to friction this
    will be the nice trajectory there so that is a this is what a a standard hanging
    pendulum and look at it go pendula are very very very very important in the history
    of science they are sort of part of almost every important measurement in history
    um like gravitational constants you know Electro kolum Force um apparently there
    was a time when they used to use the period of a pendulum to do prospecting for
    iron ore because you can measure the D like the the period of a pendulum very
    very accurately and it's going to be defined by the density it's like the gravitational
    constant the gravitational force is a part of that uh equation of motion so apparently
    they would just like move these very very very precise pendula over parts of the
    ground where they thought there might be iron ore and then if they measured a
    change in the period that's an that's a reason to believe that there's a higher
    density in the column between you and the center of the earth this is I read about
    this in a book I had a hard time validating verifying that information but nonetheless
    it's very it's a pendula pendulums very good stuff um pendulums are also a nice
    example of like that periodic motion I mentioned briefly last time how we think
    about time there's like the the there's like stopwatch time which always counts
    up but then there's kind of like wall clock time that resets every so often and
    with something like an oscillator like this you sort of you're thinking in that
    phasic sort of like time you know goes from zero to some Maximum and then it like
    resets and then that's we call that a full cycle many many parts of biology ology
    have this kind of like phasic

  text: behavior um a lot of my research historically has been on Locomotion and that
    has a lot of pendulums in it um the main one that you would think about with the
    pendulum is like The Swinging leg um but there's another much more dramatic and
    Central pendulum which is the inverted pendulum of your sort of standing body
    so this is a pendulum hanging from a a central Pivot Point um but but you could
    lift this thing up until it's all the way on top and then have it be up here as
    an inverted pendulum and at this place uh so at the bottom here this is a stable
    point because if we just let it run this is where it will wind up this is in the
    language of dynamical systems um this is called an unstable point because technically
    speaking if you placed this here precisely at you know the angle of deflection
    equals zero this would stay it's it would sort of stand up in the same way that
    this marker stands up on the desk um but the reality but because this is an unstable
    point a any perturbation from to the left or the right is going to cause it like
    if you if this is not perfectly straight if it's a little bit off to the right
    right then gravity is going to pull it down and then it's going to keep pulling
    it down until it falls down there so you can balance a a p so you can hang a pendulum
    and it's passively stable gravity does all the work for you you don't have to
    worry about it um if you have if the pendulum has if the base of support has extent
    if it's nonzero base of support you can balance it happily on a flat surface and
    it will also stay there passively forever um but if it's if it's not then you
    can balance it you then the only way that you can balance it upright is if you
    are actively controlling it so this is the classic like boom broom trick where
    you can just like balance something on your hand and you can do it because I'm
    moving around the base of support to make sure that the that the whole thing never
    Falls over but I can't so this is all by way of preamble to the recordings we're
    about to do so if you think about in some idealized pendulum and this is the center
    of Mass on top of it uh remember we're spending a lot of time thinking about Force
    equals mass time acceleration

  text: um where this is the mass which we're assuming the mass doesn't change so
    we can sort of assume that Force equals acceleration some approximation um and
    so if you're you know in the idealized form you manag to standing up here if the
    projection of the center of mass onto the floor if the distance from that projection
    from this infimal base of support is zero then it'll be happily standing ight
    forever um if instead we're off by a little bit and the projection of the center
    of mass has a distance here from the base of support then in a very intuitive
    sense that gravity pulls things down Gravely pulling like that and then this distance
    there will be sort of P pushing the object away so that's why it's unstable because
    any deflection from zero and it will start to fall and the farther that it falls
    the more it gets pushed away so it'll be accelerating away from that sort of stable
    Point um and so if I'm if you're supporting it like the broom then you can make
    you can fix that by moving around the base of support on the ground um but if
    you yourself are the pendulum in question and you are you know imagine my center
    of mass is here and I'm standing on my one little leg if I I can um the only way
    that I can really have any control over where my body is is by the forces that
    I'm putting into the ground to my foot um so if we now imagine that's me that's
    my center of mass this joint here is the only place that I can push into the ground
    and so if I'm leaning a little bit too far forward I can push with my toe and
    push myself back if I'm lean a little too far back I can push with my heel not
    really I can I can lean forward I can do something to try to like change the forces
    to push myself in that direction but in in general if I'm not if I don't have
    monkey feet or grippers on my on the ground I can only really push so that means
    that my center of mass has to stay within this base of support range in order
    for me to be able to maintain standing posture without doing something dramatic
    like taking a step that's usually what we can do so if we're assuming that the
    task is to stand upright without taking a step the goal

    that I can sort of move move around the force I'm pushing into the ground and
    sort of push my body back and forth to where it needs to go so that is balance
    and standing posture in a nutshell um all of this that we're doing here it falls
    under the category of biomechanics anytime you hear anyone talking about like
    forces and mechanics and Newton's laws and centers of mass and joints and cors
    and stuff like that you're you're hearing someone talk about biomechanics um but
    if you think about sort of like zoom out a little bit from those low-level physics
    and start thinking instead about the you know start thinking about the this physical
    object now as a biological system with a biological system with muscles and neurons
    and sensory systems and stuff like that um you can start trying to ask the questions
    from the sort of neuroscience perspective of how does all of that sort of play
    out in a a human person with things like joints and muscles and stuff like that
    so how do I if I'm if I'm because we're very very good at standing up this body
    configuration with the two feet and the arms that are that are off the ground
    this is wild in the animal kingdom this is a wild way to be musculos skeletally
    um pretty much all other mammals are quadrip heads um the only other bipeds out
    there are birds and most of them fly um the ground birds are arguably better bipeds
    than we are because they have like 450 million years of evolution on us so uh
    good for them but generally speaking like for Animals as big as we are to to support
    your entire body weight of off the ground with Just 2 feet is wacky it's like
    unpress ented there we really there's no other animals at least in the Maman Kingdom
    that have um bipedal locomotion kangaroos are a good example but they they can't
    really walk on two legs when they're when they're moving they can bounce on two
    legs but when they're when they're in place they sort of you know crawl around
    on four feet and they use their tails um animals like uh like bears and apes and
    stuff like that can walk on two feet but they tend to be they're knuckle Walkers
    um we are I believe I'm always like waiting to be find a counter example but at
    this point I should probably just accept that there aren't any uh we're like the
    only obligate bipeds in the Maman Kingdom where obligate bipad means like we really
    don't have like another option here like we it's bip or nothing um and we are
    also as far as they can figure out the only animal that has two of the main limbs

    we gave up a lot to have these like grabbing objects um and the cost was that
    we had now have to do this sort of gymnastics routine every time we want to get
    from point A to point B so thinking about this um like the neural bases of bipedalism
    and standing posture is one of those things that feels like kind of like a baser
    level of behavior than we tend to think about when we're thinking about the Majesty
    of human you know neuroscience and biology um but it's really fundamental and
    it's really core to like what we are as organisms and creatures so I think it's
    worth consideration here and and yeah yeah and so with that I think we can start
    transitioning towards like the data collection part of this so if we assume now
    that we all have the shared desire to understand how we weird bipedal humans manage
    to stand as effectively as we do stand upright and walk around as effectively
    as we do um we can start now trying to think of this as empirical scientists and
    start asking the question of if the if that is if the desired outcome the desera
    of our research Endeavors is to understand the neural bases of let's say just
    for Simplicity sake standing posture what are the measurements that we can take
    and what are the analyses that we can do and that that would give us insight into
    the underpinnings of that behavior um and there's lot of options um but we're
    going to do some simplified not some it's not even all that simplified but we're
    going to take um a full body perspective like you could go in and say oh well
    I want to figure out the sensitivity like how do we detect our lean angle like
    is it the vestibular organs in our inner ear is it the pressure under our foot
    is it the is it the the the proprioceptive forces and our ankles how can we measure
    the sensitivities of those things how can we sort of understand those circuits
    what are some other animals we can look at and you can do the kind of like the
    classic reductive um like biological stuff and start looking at like the the properties
    of of the muscles and we can you know cut up some cavers and see what's the density
    of of you know somata sensory organs in the bottom of the feet we can do that
    kind of like like zooming in on one part of the task um but necessarily doing
    that will leave out the actual behavior that we care about and what what we would
    would call the ecologically valid Behavior behavior of

    care about standing posture then we care about standing posture in the real world
    we don't care about standing posture in the lab in some weird artificial environment
    that we concocted so that we could have something that we could study um we might
    have to use that to be able to make any progress but secretly we we will feel
    a little bit sad because we will know that we have created an artificial representation

    so with that said yeah uh I won't go I won't do the whole Biz about this but also
    jumping exists we're going to course I'm jumping too jumping is kind of like this
    except instead of like leaning you're you're putting Force into the ground and
    if you put more Force into the ground then you weigh you'll leave the ground until
    you have bled off that additional energy and then you'll come back down and do
    something roughly equivalent to that uh yeah um yeah okay how do you feel about
    that so far emotionally prepared for what is to come great [Applause] so in a
    little bit here I have an hour and hour to go which there would be enough time

    are going to allow us to record um full body 3D kinematic data of a human person
    standing in space this human person is me I would love to do a thing where we
    like record you guys and do that but like it just the time doesn't really work
    out um and so this weird confguration of cheap cameras and free software will
    will give us an approximation of my body uh at 30 frames per second down to some
    level of precision um at the centimeter scale of precision for my joints and the
    approximation will be roughly equivalent to this it will tell me roughly where
    my head was where each body segment was where each joint was and this will be
    kind of like the this is the data model that will come out of it um and this is

    out a timer we do like 20 30 seconds of standing in each each one so this will
    be recording one this will be recording two uh sorry 0 1 and then two I'm going
    to do the same thing doing this different than I've done the past years but I'm
    going to do the same thing except now I'm going to do the same thing while holding
    on to a chair so I'll like so I'll start out doing just like freestanding and
    then next time I'll like lean over and like have my hand on the desk and sort
    of do the same kinds of tasks um then after that I'm going to do I'm going to
    take a couple big jumps just jump standing jump as high as I can jump uh and then
    we'll do another one where I'll do like I'll jump in place for like 30 seconds
    and then at that point that'll be enough recordings um so that yeah so we're going
    to so this will be so we'll get 1 2 3 four five total recordings which should
    process in the moment depending on how fast how long it takes set up I may or
    may not truncate the processing so that we can get through them all um but the
    your task as you're watching the the show um is just kind of think about these
    behaviors and think about them relative to the kind of the the biomechanic Center
    of mass types of uh of conversations we've been having so far and just make some
    predictions about what these data will look like um and you could think about
    it at like the full joint level like you know down to the level of like knees
    and ankles and shoulders and stuff like that um but that can be a little overwhelming
    so I would also recommend thinking about it just in terms of like if you boiled
    this whole thing down to just a ground plane a foot and a leg and then a center
    of mass what would you expect to see like what's going to be the difference between
    like standing on two legs versus standing on one leg what's gonna be the difference

    there's your ability to make predictions about what this is going to go is how
    you know that you're operating within a theoretical framework they're thinking
    about there is an assumption that I am making that boiling down the this hyper
    complex object into a singular 3D Point Mass and and and saying I we'll be able
    to say things about that we'll be able to predict the motion of that point mass

    this without crashing my computer too uh which is always fun so great has anybody
    here worked anywhere near motion capture before any like physical therapy or anything

    where you will have seen it will be like behind the scenes and of movies and video
    games and stuff like that um you know a lot of like Lord of the Rings stuff of
    Golem and smile run running around um all right uh but it has been around and
    used to study human movement for quite some time um arguably video like the invention
    of video uh was technically what am I doing here that I got that I have this this
    yes um and then this so the original like video was created to study horses in
    motion based off a a barbat uh from Vanderbilt the guy like the robber bearing
    um about whether or not horses ever was there was ever a point in their Gallop

    solve that bet uh Vanderbilt commissioned a photographer to like take a bunch
    of sequential videos of pictures of a horse in full gallop and was able to show
    that there is in fact a phase where they're all off the ground where the feet
    are all off the ground um but in since then motion capture has been used in the
    study of human movement and clinical stuff um for as long as we've been doing
    that what am I doing doing this okay uh but also traditionally it's it's not a
    very common thing to do because it's very very expensive um the motion capture
    lab I have in Richards invol has like A4 million dollar worth of motion capture
    equipment in it and it's in a a room that was specifically built for the purpose
    of doing motion capture and it's you know it's a very good system it's very very
    precise but it's also a huge pain it to use and it's just it's expensive so the
    the you know there's the the number of people out there who are studying human
    movement is much much larger than the number of people can who can afford motion
    capture so that was kind of a part of the motivation that I had for making this
    strange system um was basically realizing around 2017 when a software came out
    called uh open pose that used convolutional neural networks to basically draw
    a stick figure on a person in a video and I saw that and then sometime later realized
    that that capacity to basically draw like a 2d skeleton estimate on a person in
    a scene was kind of enough to build a motion capture system out of um and then
    you know that was sort of an idea that I had and sort of the thought was yeah
    that's a cool idea but like I don't know how to write code and that seems like
    way too much work so I guess I'll never do it and then three years later Co hit
    and I lost access to my lab for an undef period of time and I also lost faith
    in the academic system uh pretty much entirely and started like rethinking the
    idea that using I'm going to have to unplug this camera now um

    thinking about like you know is this Behavior actually making the world a better

    are generally trying to like improve the world um but we're trapped in these systems
    of of communication that just like it just doesn't serve like it it made sense
    in the 1800s it just doesn't make sense now so I personally transitioned away

    the modern sort of uh what's the word the the arising technology of just like
    computer vision and sort of like the wacky stuff we can do with that to to play
    the role that the markers used to play in traditional motion capture systems um

    degree in philosophy then I started doing more perceptual motor neuroscience and
    kind of like was studying vision from like a vision science perspective um and
    was feeling not it felt insufficient it felt like incomplete and it wasn't until
    I started digging into I started like found my way into some of the more biomechanics
    approach to movement um that because I was studying visually guided Locomotion
    in an environment that really didn't have any consideration of like the physics
    of being an object moving through space um and when I started reading the biomechanics
    papers was when it a lot of things started to click for me and those papers had
    a bunch of skeletons in it calm it down guys um and that's why there's skeletons
    everywhere just because it's sort of like this it's like kind of a joke that I
    studi Neuroscience from the perspective of a skeleton because that's like physics
    wise it's mostly skeleton the neural components are really not not really Newton
    doesn't really notice the Neuroscience parts of it he mostly notices the skeleton
    anyway anyway um so so this is the latest form of the software um actually it's
    not uh the the main so the current stage of development of free moap is that the
    the the core software is a little bit behind the development side of it so we're
    using the this camera stuff it's very slow for some reason why are we so slow

    this case will be light so light bounces off of me bounces goes through the lens
    of the camera gets absorbed by the camera sensor which is just a little rectangular
    silicone wafer silicon wafer whatever whichever one of those is accurate um and
    yeah and then we will be recording the we will be pulling samples from a light
    cone from three different locations in space um 30 times per second uh and there's
    been a lot like a lot a lot like years of my life has been spent uh making sure
    that the videos that get recorded from these cameras are uh synchronous so as
    these cameras are pulling as each camera is sort of pulling uh you know frames
    from its field of view um there's a lot of code under the hood that's making sure
    that each camera is pulling at close to the same time as the others as possible
    so we're pulling syn Eyes videos so we talked about the mentioned last time the
    sort of the concept of like spatio temporal calibration to in recording and sort
    of that just like the spatial components and the temporal components great the
    temporal components here are handled by the software so we are going to assume
    that all the the samples from each camera are synchronized in time to some approximation
    um so the second part of that is the spatial so let's see so those are all rotated
    are they rotated the same way they are which is counterclockwise I think that
    should work did I get that right I got it backwards it's always backwards yeah

  text: okay good um yeah great so it's not using the space particularly well but
    don't worry about that so this is so now I'm going to point the cameras so I'm
    going to stand right here and so I'm going to try to point the cameras that they
    can all get a good view of that spot all right oh I have that one that's nice
    we also have that that's nice okay now unfortunately I am I am going to I'll do
    that later um so the images are a little dark I think that is the the nature of
    the Beast another part of the of the game here with Freo cap was building the
    cheapest possible system I could possibly get so intentionally targeting like
    garbage cameras these are really garbage cameras like they cost $10 is a pop um
    on the assumption that you know as a researcher buying four GoPros is nothing
    but if I'm trying to make something that's accessible to the world uh GoPros are
    expensive um so trying to build it on the cheapest possible Hardware was a part
    of the game um okay so we're going to have to do uh some projective geometry at
    some point so I mentioned that we have the temporal synchronization happening
    through the software um but we are also going to need to know the position of
    each of these cameras in space we're going to specifically need to know the six
    degree of Freedom position so XYZ location then XYZ rotation so six total numbers
    six degrees of freedom um and the way we're going to do that is by way of a calibration
    routine um that involves a calibration object um this is called a Cho these little
    markers here are called Aro markers and this is a calibration object which many
    um you know SC every scientific tool will have some calibration component to it
    and the typical pattern for calibration is you're use you use the system to measure
    something that you know the answer to I'm going to use this to measure the position
    of these Corners in the board because I know that these Corners are all 58 mm
    apart like I know that these blast squares are 58 millim

  text: wide so if I use this system and I record this shape I know what the right
    answer is so if I if I record the position of the board and I check the numbers
    and it says yeah these are 58 mm apart then I now have some confidence that the
    system is working as intended and now I can use it to measure the unknown thing
    which is the body in space that I'm not going to have any other additional measurement
    and insight about um so every form of scientific research is going to involve
    calibration at some point in some cases that calibration is done at the factory
    when they're where they make the tool um but in this kind of like more hacky DIY
    world we uh we make do with our own stuff okay how we doing on timeing okay on
    time all right so recording so basically what this looks like is I take the board
    and I show it to the cameras and I make sure that each camera has shared views
    so in this case they can all see it at the same time um oh I'm going to need to
    turn that off actually uh all right you can look here but I have to turn this
    off because there's too much light I I was you got to be careful with the light
    so uh you can look there if you need to um so basically the board the cameras
    can see the board they have shared views of the board um so they can you can do
    the kind of the the the actually not so simple math of if I am camera a and I
    can see the board from this angle and at the same time camera B can see the board
    and I see it from this angle then camera a must be in this position relative to
    camera B and vice versa um make sure that works usually when I do this part of
    the class I bring my grad student in to help me out and this time he was busy
    so I was like I can do it all on my own and I can do it all on my own but it is
    definitely one of the cases I was like I sure wish Aaron was here it'd be nice
    to have an additional nervous system doing this stuff uh so now I'm just manually
    moving stuff from one folder to another just because of the stage of software
    it's in um PR what we doing

    having a little bit more running on trust that I would have preferred okay well
    as that runs um let's see what are you doing why okay calling the audible so well
    remember how so uh I will have to process these offline because it's not set up
    and I don't have the brain space to do the online debugging so this will be a
    lot more prediction than usual just usually I can make this happen in the same
    time um but but for now so we've done calibration now we're going to do simple
    standing so twoot standing one foot and one foot on the left one foot on the right
    um we would call this a control condition because this is the one where we're
    not there's nothing will be manipulated in this case um and then we're going to
    do this sort of manipulation condition which is going to be very similar to this
    but with this sort of sort of extra factor of I will be supporting myself on a
    chair or a table or something like that and your I guess I can use this yeah it's
    that um and then we'll do the jumping stuff so for you know yeah and we're not
    going to be getting uh we're not going to be getting real time output from this
    this class unfortunately but that just means that the your mental model of prediction
    must work across times okay now I unfortunately have to take my shoes off

    I had been smart I would have at least worn lightly colored socks um but you can
    see how dark the ground is and you just can't see my feet relative to the ground
    so I will Tom soyer up my feet now you can't um this is one of the in a real recording
    I would be like I'd have lights and stuff like that um it's also one of these
    cases where like it tends to work best like outside in the sun because the sun
    is very very bright um yeah there you go now you can see my feet um still a bit
    dark still very dark that one's good okay so one and two are a little dark manual
    oh it looks better on my screen okay okay so can I have someone can I request
    a a stopwatch person thank you uh so I'm going to ask for like basically 30 second
    intervals um so I'll let you know when it's ready to go um I do have to turn this
    off again and I'll leave that down and all right where is the and I want to be
    standing like here great all right uh I'll let you know it's not right now so
    here we go so I'm going to stand here and I guess yeah start it now so this is
    me standing uh I'm kind of already bored with this so I'm going to lean I'm going
    to be sort of intentionally in all these cases leaning as far as I can lean sort
    of within ideally without moving my feet um so I'm leaning all the way to the
    right and all the way forward uh let me know when we hit 30 there cool no great
    okay so now I'm on one foot and my Bas of support has now gotten appreciably smaller
    and I'm wiggling around both for fun and because I'm off balance um so again sort

    some strong predictions we can make about the position of my center of mass relative
    to my Bas of support and you make those preditions even stronger thank you um
    and Y uh when the base of support gets smaller your ability to predict the location
    of the center of Mass gets better like you have more predictive capacity because
    it is a more constrained task there are fewer ways that I can successfully complete
    the task of standing upright when I only have one foot on the ground than I do
    when I have two feet on the ground and and done [Applause] okay great so with
    those predictions in mind um how am I going to do this I think I will yeah that
    works great this is my now my standing stick um so same thing uh sorry I your
    name stopwatch friend stopwatch friend what's your name isab Isabelle thank you
    uh same thing now for the let's say let's call this a support condition we're
    now going to be using like a stick to support myself um outside of my biologically
    prescribed base of support so we go over here and I will stand for a little bit
    so just go ahead and start the timer whenever this is just kind of calibration
    purposes and then now uh I'm going to do the same kind of task of Leaning as far
    as I can relative to my base of support except now I have this stick to sort of
    assist me so with the knowledge and theoretical models of human body that you
    are armed with like how do you think this is going to change that data um so now
    I'm going to go onto my right foot similarly playing all over the place and let's
    assume for like when we get this data back you're not going to the stick is not
    going to be in the data uh we will know that it was there and we'll know that
    this hand is is mounted to the ground um but if you think about what the data
    will look like you can have some predictions there and now we switch feet and
    so again just like think about it what what do you think would

  text: be different here it's been a long day it's like standing in place is not
    the hardest thing in the world but I'm making it difficult and okay cool okay
    thank you Isabelle um H this next part I hope I don't I hope I don't die on camera
    but if I do just analyze the data okay okay um so for this one I am going to record
    I'll say three because that's what I wrote uh but this is going to be standing
    high jump so I'm going to try to jump as high as I can from a standing place and
    again think about think about what that will look like think about what it will
    look like at this level think about what's happening at the physics level where
    is the force coming from what when it where is it coming from at the the start
    where is it going at the end what's happening in the middle um what could be measured
    what could be inferred what additional data will you wish you had um and if I
    break anything you know you can have questions about that okay uh I don't need
    a timer for this so record so it goes in here hello I don't want to whack myself
    there God I used to I used not weigh as much okay and and that's all the knees
    I have today I ask do a little bit more okay so big jumps discreet jumps pauses
    in the middle lot of arm swinging and knee torquing this big hip joint doing its
    thing and some amount of air time some amount of cheating in the air time oo uh
    okay um

  text: see this going to stay on when I do this next part if it does probably this
    will be more probably be more reliable uh okay okay so now instead of doing sub
    veral discreet high jumps I'm just going to bounce in place uh and I'll bounce
    in place for as long as I want to which I'm not going to ask anyone to time it
    I'm just going to go until I want to stop may do at least 10 and then I'll just
    go until I'm tired and I'm already tired so we'll see how that goes oh also pointing
    out I pulled my legs up I pulled the pants up both to expose the nice pale skin
    below which does well this feels bright to us but our eyes um the human eye is
    incredibly good at adjusting to changes in luminance so relative to like a sunny
    day it's basically Pitch Black in here and we're just really really good at adapting
    to that um but so I exposed my legs both because they are lighter and they are
    contrasting with the carpet but I'm also trying to give the cameras a view of
    my knee um as opposed to having it be blocked again like if you're trying if you're
    trying to predict where my knee is it's going to be way harder if it's being covered
    by cloth than it is if it's directly exposed so it's not just a fashion statement
    it's empirically grounded okay so yeah so we'll say we'll call this discret jumps
    and we'll call this repeated Hops and boun so again thinking about the behavior
    thinking about the mechanics thinking about the joint torqus thinking about the
    fatigue where does the energy come from what did I have for dinner last night
    these are the questions of biology okay I'm not going to drop time it okay so
    record standing here give that nice calibration of and now we hop okay one 2 3
    oh my God there's just so many people looking at me it's fine also I wonder there
    like are there people below us are they wondering what's happening I don't know
    how long have I been jumping how many jumps was that I don't know okay I think
    I think that's playing 10 more okay one two three four five six 7even 8

    length of time particularly if the thing you're making is something that other
    people are using uh the version of the thing that other that the people are using
    is the version that you are like ashamed of because like I the code for this I
    wrote years ago I've learned so much since then that when I look at this I'm like
    oh my God I'm so sorry to the world for what I've done to it okay so this is freemo
    Cap this is the core software um then if I do that I click on that say set active
    recording yes yes run calibration from active recording run calibration okay so
    we're now running calibration data um and it's going through I can put my shoes
    on at least um it's going through and uh detecting the boards in the screen um
    it'll take a little bit of time but at this point I think we should be able to
    get like we'll be able to look at something by the end of but before the end of
    the day which will be good does anyone have any burning questions while we're
    while the thing is running it's one of those things like I'm sure there are many
    questions so does can anyone choose one question from the many that are floating
    around I also made a mistake because I was like talking during this calibration
    thing so I was like doing it and at some point I was like blah blah blah and then
    so it's longer than it needs to be uh which is rookie mistake this is the code
    that I am like currently rewriting like I'm currently uh rebuilding the calibration
    part of it which will allow it to do much

    don't really want to do that that feels like cheating like I have recordings from
    the past but that's that feels like cheating right now um yeah H okay yes okay
    now this stuff is going through yeah great so now now now you have this object
    should I can't write now for some reason so camera 0o camera 1 camera 2 camera
    Matrix and then these are the two points that matter rotation 1 2 3 translation
    1 2 3 camera one is defined to zero so these are the six degrees of freedom that
    we need for each of the cameras so we now know where all the cameras are these
    are measured in millimeters and theoretically you know 1 and 1/2 so 1 1500 mm
    is like 1 and 1/2 m th M so they say that they're you know meter to two apart
    which checks out intuitively so now that we have that uh we can okay I think let's
    look at the jump the big jump that's the most fun one I think so that was the
    actually yeah oh it's kind of off screen there but we'll see how that goes uh
    set is active recording okay these most recent calibration and that probably the
    shortest too so go ahead and process okay okay so if all goes well do you see
    my blender you do see my blender

  text: great so now what it's doing is it's going through and in each of the videos
    it's going through frame by frame um so let say if it's a you know a thousand
    frames of recording which is you know whatever 30 seconds or something less than
    30 seconds actually um then for three cameras you have 3,000 total images and
    then in each of those images you have to run through and do the relatively heavy
    computation of using the convolutional neural network to try to detect where the
    person is in the screen uh in the recording and that will look oh actually that's
    from old okay never mind um yeah and so then once you have done that you will
    have 3,00 two-dimensional estimates of where I was in space coupled with estimates
    for where each of the cameras were in space and so you can do don't worry about
    that that's normal um you from so from the the two-dimensional estimates in the
    images plus the six degree of Freedom positions of the cameras you can triangulate
    the position of each of those point points by basically just imagining firing
    a laser so like tracking my elbow from camera 1 2 and three if you imagine you
    fired a laser from each of those cameras the place where the lasers cross over
    each other is the position of that object in space um and all of that is going
    to happen under the hood very very fast and it's all just a bunch of like like
    that kind of geometry hasn't changed in like a thousand years it's the same stuff
    that that's like uclid level geometry it's just now being done much much much
    faster on a strange rectangle of silicone and electricity um but yeah once this
    pink line oh are we still running oh good we can actually yeah so it looks roughly
    like that so this is the output from one of the videos so this is so from the
    perspective of I guess that camera this was the location of my right shoulder
    that's the left shoulder there's a bunch of points on my face these are hips ankles
    toes basically tagging all the joint centers in two-dimensional image coordinates

  text: um which we can and so yeah so that's all well and good it's useful information
    but you would have a very difficult time doing any of the the because you don't
    really have a measurement in this case of like where the ground is like you don't
    really have a measurement of what up is you have up in the image but you can see
    that the image is tilted so if you're want to say oh you're moving relative to
    gravity like if you want to say your balance over your feet those are all terms
    that happen in the reference frame of like the physics we said we call it the
    inertial reference frame um and this data is all coming in in camera sensor reference
    frame this is 0 in image coordinates just the upper left point of the screen and
    that's 0 meaning the upper left corner of the little silicone wafer the at the
    back of the camera thing um so converting that into something that is it's very
    strange that that one is like running so much slower than the others um but to
    be able to be able to talk about this data in sort of these physically grounded
    terms that we've been trying to sort of build up uh requires a transfer and sort
    of a lot of computation to sort of to get this data referenced in a inertial reference
    frame okay what is going on okay cool um so now the pink lines are gone which
    means we've done all the 2D estimation and this white much much faster line is
    doing all of the triangulation so so uh 550,000 data points uh just cranking yeah
    and now how we going doing that recording data this takes a s now okay yeah it's
    now saving stuff down to disk and now it will with any luck start cranking yeah
    come on buddy yeah yes and so now this this part of the code is now sending so
    at this point we've we've we've we've done the main task we've recorded the PE
    the person we've done the two-dimensional thing the 3D reconstruction has actually

    is converting it into a human into some visualizable format so something that

    like a massive CSV Excel spreadsheet is good but like it's still not a a term
    that we can really make any sense out of so or a format that we can make sense
    out of so this is blender which is a 3D animation software and this is where we
    see if it actually worked well which I feel let's see how it does so I'm not in
    the screen there we go here I am it's okay so this one is not looking the best
    so you see this one it's um the image is upside down is it going to it's going
    to fix oh man there we go so that was actually a nice uh case where this is a
    good view this is a good view this one it's seeing the skeleton upside down uh
    so this reconstructive view is not going to look right because a third of the
    data is flipped upside down and luckily I took a few steps forward and then it
    fixed itself and so now this is a much better looking skeleton um see time go
    can't time so now that I know it works I can blame the point um it's a little
    bit rotated which I can fix later so rotate around X there you go um this pink
    and blue ball here is the calculated Center of mass um the skeleton is sort of
    more for visualization than actual data um this these stick figures here those

    so the ground plane we're going to call XY up is z um and yeah and so this is
    a Time series plot we talked about these last time so the x axis is time and then
    the Y AIS is whatever the the Z value that is the height that's the height of
    my center of mass above the ground and if you recall so if gravity didn't change
    my mass didn't change so that means the height tells you my potential energy uh
    if we assume that this is where I'm this is my standing height we can call that
    zero if we want to that's zero potential energy and then here we see something
    interesting happening so before I you've seen this several times now I do got
    to stop and we're going to talk about this at length next time um but just imagine
    at like my center of mass level like we have some guess about what this Behavior
    corres responds to um so think about what is this dip what is this peak and what
    is this dip again and oops wish I didn't do that come on there we go so there
    we go that's my lowest point skeleton's kind of screwy uh just because it's a
    weird View and I'm kind of off screen here um but going to go up and that's the
    peak that's the apex of the jump that's the highest this is the place my my potential
    energy is at its highest and my kinetic energy in the in the Z position is zero
    I'm I am paused at that height um and now I'm coming back down and again the the
    the data is not the best in the world but you can see that kind of I don't just
    land with like straight legs I land and I bend into it there's intuitive reasons
    why but then there's also like deeper biomechanical and biopys and physiological
    reasons why why this is a lot of energy I have to bleed off and I don't want to

    measurement because even in these cases where the data is not that great and the
    skeleton gets all wble garble in these in these particular moments the overall
    trajectory is roughly speaking what you would expect it to be so even in context
    where the data has you know Fidelity issues uh you can still talk about the global
    data because it's basically a giant smoothing algorithm to just collapse this
    entire thing down to a singular point we uh and then I really I I got to go but
    I can't help myself uh in range around frame 3030 calculate the whole thing okay
    let play so that is is the frame by frame measurement of it you can see this the
    3D trajectory oh why did it go oh it's not doing the whole path oh cuz it's much
    longer than that uh dat paths all paths there you go and here we can even take
    the whole guy hide him hide him so that is the mechanical estimate of the global
    Behavior okay I will take my time I'll I'll clean this up um and think about think
