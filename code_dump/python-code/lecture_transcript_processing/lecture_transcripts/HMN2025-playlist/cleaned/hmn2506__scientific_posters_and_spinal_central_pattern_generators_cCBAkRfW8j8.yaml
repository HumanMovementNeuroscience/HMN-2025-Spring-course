full_transcript: "Okay, all right. Hello everybody, sorry for the slow start. I was\
  \ trying to get some stuff downloaded that I should have done at home. So, standard\
  \ check-in: we are officially in week number six, which is a fine place to be. We\
  \ have covered a lot of material; I would say we've covered the majority of the\
  \ hardcore biomechanics content. I almost said the motor control stuff, but I will\
  \ probably get back to that later.\n\nThis week, we are going to take a little bit\
  \ of time to discuss some examples of published papers\u2014something that I really\
  \ like. I have some experience going through a published article and trying to make\
  \ sense of it. Then, on Wednesday, we'll have a small group assignment to help you\
  \ all prepare for the exam, which is related to the SL poster proposal. Both of\
  \ these will be due at the end of this week, probably next week.\n\nSo, I initially\
  \ got these dates wrong; I will fix that later. The idea is that at this point,\
  \ I have talked about some of the topic areas, usually in the review. We have spent\
  \ a good amount of time collecting data in class and sort of eyeballing it\u2014\
  looking through it and trying to figure out what kind of stories could be told from\
  \ it. We came in with some basic hypotheses and things like that.\n\nFor the next\
  \ two periods, which will be three classes since next Monday is a holiday, I want\
  \ to prepare you all to start thinking about your own chosen topic, whatever that\
  \ happens to be. We will use the thought processes and mental frameworks that I\
  \ have been discussing in the context of human body and human movement research\
  \ based on kinematic motion capture data. So, starting to dig into the topic area\
  \ you've chosen and thinking more deeply about it is where we are headed. About\
  \ the methodologies that are used to pursue your topic of interest, I know that\
  \ the way we gathered that information was a combination of discussing topics and\
  \ also selecting a paper. The paper part is, technically, the most relevant component\
  \ to the poster proposal, but I want to make sure it\u2019s framed in the context\
  \ of my interest in this topic.\n\nSo, I am trying to flesh out the methodologies\
  \ involved in your area of research\u2014the empirical grounding of it. This includes\
  \ understanding what methodologies are used, what tools are utilized to collect\
  \ relevant data for your topic, and how this connects to the conversations we've\
  \ been having around cameras and motion capture. Specifically, what is the core\
  \ empirical tool involved? What does it measure, and what units are derived from\
  \ it? What are the data types and structures that the scientific insights in your\
  \ area of focus are built upon?\n\nThis will culminate in a follow-up proposal\u2014\
  Proposal Number Two\u2014which will be a fleshed-out version of the original concept\
  \ of identifying a paper I care about. I have been considering what kind of mechanism\
  \ to use for this process. I think it will ultimately be a base-level assignment\
  \ that will exist on Canvas and in the GitHub repository. This will involve you\
  \ copy-pasting some text from your profile, which you've been generating, into a\
  \ chat with the bot that will be prompted in the server.\n\nThe idea is that you'll\
  \ start with the last relevant piece of text you have regarding your interests and\
  \ the paper you've chosen. You will take that into a chat space, and the bot will\
  \ be prompted to ask you about certain layers of the methodology we\u2019ve discussed.\
  \ At the end of that interaction, you'll ask for a summary, possibly using a prompt\
  \ that I will provide. Then you'll take that summary and put it into another chat\
  \ for additional layers of conversation.\n\nThe output of those conversations will\
  \ resemble the poster proposal, serving as a fleshed-out version of what you are\
  \ examining. The reason for this structure is that I considered simply creating\
  \ one chat, like we've been doing, but this approach allows for more depth. This\
  \ sort of approach does all the necessary tasks, but it starts to get really complicated\
  \ and enters a space where these types of AI, as implemented here, can\u2019t really\
  \ function effectively. They are not capable of handling two-part instructions like\
  \ \"do this and then do that.\" They are just not set up for that. You can set up\
  \ the code on the back end to handle some tasks automatically, but it is much easier\
  \ to create two versions of the prompt and provide clear instructions for intelligent\
  \ humans that say, \"do this and then do that.\" \n\nThe idea is that you'll be\
  \ preparing yourself for the next conversation, which will also give you some experience\
  \ in directed prompting and that kind of AI training. The conversations and prompts\
  \ I\u2019ve set up for you will be based on the lectures I\u2019ve been giving,\
  \ which are available on the YouTube playlist linked in the server. So, I will be\
  \ doing something that might not be obvious to you, such as pulling the transcripts\
  \ from those lectures, extracting the main points, and using that content to guide\
  \ our discussions. \n\nThat's why I am considering that set of chats as an exam-like\
  \ object where you\u2019ll have specific tasks to complete. If you don\u2019t complete\
  \ those tasks, you will receive a lower grade, and it will be cumulative based on\
  \ previous activities, which I think aligns with the legal definition of a test.\
  \ \n\nAdditionally, this will prepare you for the Proposal Part, which is another\
  \ requirement in this class structure. By this week, my aim is to have you hypothetically\
  \ ready to start working on the actual poster with the level of detail it needs.\
  \ It\u2019s the lecture material that has delayed me from providing you with anything\
  \ today. I have all that content ready; it\u2019s just that uploading the videos\
  \ takes a long time. I had to wait for the last one to upload, which I just put\
  \ up this morning. I plan to have everything compiled and ready for you by next\
  \ Wednesday, so we can discuss it in class, and you can ask questions and engage\
  \ further. \n\nLeading into that, hypothetically by the end of Week Seven, which\
  \ is next week, I will spend some time discussing the posters themselves. I will\
  \ upload some templates into the server and ensure they are available in the relevant\
  \ location on campus soon. But before I proceed, does anyone have any questions\
  \ so far? Sort of like concerns about stress levels, there are things that if you\
  \ knew, you would feel more comfortable about your status here. Someone sent me\
  \ an email asking about the poster structure itself, and that's what we're going\
  \ to talk about today. Great, okay. \n\nSo, the poster itself\u2014these are just\
  \ some examples that I found from previous courses taught. This is made more difficult\
  \ because I don't have PowerPoint on this computer, but that's okay. We have that\
  \ one. This is a PowerPoint slide. It is akin to PowerPoint or Google Slides. I\
  \ think it's equivalent to Keynote on Mac. I'm sure a lot of you have PowerPoint\
  \ slides in it. Long story short, the nice thing about something like PowerPoint\
  \ is that it is a vector-based art tool. \n\nThis means that these visuals are defined\
  \ not by pixels on an image\u2014like most images where, if you zoom in on them,\
  \ you start to see the pixels\u2014but rather vector-based graphics are not like\
  \ that. They are defined mathematically. For example, this curve here is not defined\
  \ as a set of dots; it\u2019s defined as a mathematical definition of how to draw\
  \ this shape. Everything on the PowerPoint page is defined in this way. \n\nThe\
  \ advantage is that you can zoom it up infinitely, and you'll never see the pixels\
  \ because it is not based on pixels. The opposite of vector-based is raster-based,\
  \ which applies to most images. If you take a screenshot and zoom in, you can only\
  \ zoom in to the level of the resolution of the image. Therefore, most posters are\
  \ made with a vector-based visualization method. \n\nI would say PowerPoint is like\
  \ the entry-level version of that or an equivalent of PowerPoint. For the vast majority\
  \ of you, I would say almost all of you, except for someone who has a really specific\
  \ interest in design, I recommend using PowerPoint or Google Slides. Just create\
  \ a single page, a single slide that has information about your poster. If you're\
  \ feeling fancy and want to do the professional version of this, the main professional\
  \ vector graphics editor is Adobe Illustrator. You all have free access to the Adobe\
  \ Creative Suite through your Northeastern email. If you need help with access,\
  \ just ask someone other than me how to get it. You can download Creative Cloud\
  \ and log in with your Northeastern account. However, you need to go to a specific\
  \ website and submit a request for a license. Unfortunately, this process takes\
  \ about a day or two. If you're interested, you can proceed with that.\n\nThere's\
  \ also Inkscape, which is a free alternative to Adobe Illustrator. I have used it,\
  \ and it has improved over time. When I was in graduate school, it wasn't very good,\
  \ and I wouldn't have considered it a viable alternative. However, I think for basic\
  \ usage, it might be helpful. Just don't expect it to be at the same level as Illustrator.\
  \ Realistically, if you're new to this area, you probably won't be using professional-level\
  \ tools, so giving it a shot might be worthwhile.\n\nRegardless of what you choose,\
  \ the work you'll be doing to prepare the content for the poster will be independent\
  \ of the software you use. If you try something fancy and later decide you don't\
  \ want to go that route, you can always convert it later.\n\nNow, what should go\
  \ on the poster itself? A poster is essentially a distillation of a paper, which\
  \ I believe is the best way to think about it for our class. However, this doesn't\
  \ mean a poster can't be other things. The default purpose of a poster is to represent\
  \ a particular study, typically one that you are conducting. You will take it to\
  \ a conference, display it, and hope people come by to talk to you about it. I showed\
  \ you some pictures of scientific conference poster sessions, which illustrate the\
  \ structure we are mimicking here.\n\nAt the end of the semester, around the week\
  \ of April 7th, there will be a poster session for all the inquiries classes. You\
  \ will be assigned one of the days for your presentation. You will present your\
  \ poster alongside half of the students from each other class. If you aren't presenting,\
  \ your assignment will be to circulate and engage with the other posters. You know\
  \ a certain number of posters from this class and a certain number of posters from\
  \ the other classes, so you can get the experience of what that sort of process\
  \ looks like and feels like. Yeah, so like I said before and I'll say it again,\
  \ there\u2019s the default version of the assignment and then there\u2019s the part\
  \ of the assignment where you can do whatever else you want to do. So, I'm mostly\
  \ going to be talking about the default assignment, which is to pick a paper and\
  \ present that paper as if you were a person. I don\u2019t know if the other class\
  \ has specific guidelines on whether you need to role-play as a grad student in\
  \ the lab or if you can just present your paper in the third person. But yeah, you\
  \ also have the option to add more citations if you want or talk about other topics.\
  \ If you want to use any of the data that we covered in this class as part of your\
  \ poster, we can set that up. Basically, any of the data that you've seen before,\
  \ before April 7th, I\u2019ll have that available where you can pull screenshots\
  \ and discuss it. If you want to experience using actual data that you've been a\
  \ part of as part of your presentation, that's a viable option. So, in terms of\
  \ how to put the poster together, if you're taking a paper or topic area, how do\
  \ you actually create a poster? There are instructions about that, which I think\
  \ might include some instructions from other classes. The basic idea is that you\u2019\
  re not supposed to include all the information from the paper on the poster. You\
  \ don't want to have what we affectionately call a wall of text poster. We all know\
  \ what it feels like to be confronted with a big wall of text; it's not fun, and\
  \ it isn't helpful for you as a person coming in. Something that really needs to\
  \ be driven home, repeatedly, is that the scientific process is primarily a process\
  \ of communication. If you're... When you are sitting alone in your lab, collecting\
  \ data and running numbers, and never actually show it to anybody else, you're not\
  \ really doing science. You're more like investigating and playing around with data.\
  \ The process of science is fundamentally a process of communication. Presenting\
  \ a poster or writing a paper is the traditional method for communicating science\
  \ to others. Presenting a poster at a conference, in a sense, unofficially counts\
  \ as a peer-review type of session. However, you can't claim that it's a peer-reviewed\
  \ poster. You are, in fact, getting your work reviewed by your peers, meaning that\
  \ others in the field will look at what you've done and have the opportunity to\
  \ point out mistakes. This peer feedback is a cornerstone of scientific practice.\
  \ \n\nI'm speaking from a somewhat jaded perspective, so I will describe this process\
  \ in idealized terms. When you are translating your research into a poster, your\
  \ job is to distill the information. You are the person who understands the project\
  \ better than anyone else. If it\u2019s your research project, you likely comprehend\
  \ the intricate details better than anyone else in the world. The individuals you\
  \ communicate with will only have a few minutes, maybe 5 to 10 minutes at most,\
  \ to engage with your work. If you look at events like the Society for Neuroscience\
  \ meeting, there are thousands of posters. As an attendee, you can't possibly see\
  \ them all. You will approach a specific area and engage with a select number of\
  \ posters, spending only a short amount of time on each. So, you'll come up to a\
  \ poster and ask about it, and your job as the presenter is to explain what the\
  \ study was about and what the findings were. Ideally, this can be communicated\
  \ in a way that someone listening could understand the study from start to finish\
  \ in about 3 to 5 minutes. They should leave with a basic understanding of your\
  \ study, such as what was done and what the results were. If you've done well, they\
  \ will be able to summarize your research without needing to know all the intricate\
  \ details. Therefore, there is a specific strategy involved in what you include\
  \ on your poster. The key takeaways that the person walks away with should align\
  \ with the main conclusions you want them to remember. In a study, you can present\
  \ the same information in five different ways, allowing the person to walk away\
  \ with five different beliefs. Hopefully, these beliefs will not be incoherent or\
  \ inconsistent. You can focus on various aspects and ensure that you're packaging\
  \ the information in a way that will make it understandable and memorable. Ideally,\
  \ when they reflect on the study, they should say that it was about this person\
  \ doing this thing and finding this result, which should align with your beliefs\
  \ about the study.\n\nNow, I mentioned what would happen if the person stands there\
  \ politely and doesn't say anything, which sometimes occurs. Typically, that's not\
  \ necessarily an insult; especially at conferences, people may be tired and just\
  \ want to grasp the main points. However, in general, in academia and the sciences,\
  \ if someone starts to criticize your work, pulling it apart and picking at the\
  \ details, it\u2019s actually a compliment. They care enough about your work to\
  \ engage with it and ask questions. This can be off-putting, particularly for students\
  \ who are accustomed to receiving grades, but when I ask a lot of questions, it's\
  \ because I want to know more. I am invested in using my time, energy, and focus\
  \ to do what I was trained to do as a scientist: peer review research by looking\
  \ for problems and mistakes. My goal isn't to target those mistakes maliciously\
  \ but to understand what\u2019s going on and ensure that the research is sound,\
  \ as we aim to create new knowledge.\n\nThis brings me to the second part of the\
  \ strategy. When you're presenting a poster, please do not just read the content\
  \ to the person; that's not engaging for anyone. Instead, present it at a high level\
  \ so that when the person asks questions, you have the answers ready. Even if you\
  \ zip through your presentation and move past certain elements, there's a learning\
  \ curve. The first time you present something, you might be surprised by the questions\
  \ you receive; however, after a few conversations, you'll find that 90% of the questions\
  \ tend to be predictable. Therefore, you should be prepared to answer those questions\
  \ based on the data on your paper. For instance, I wouldn\u2019t want to spend time\
  \ talking about the specifics, like how deep the water was in the maze or the exact\
  \ dimensions of the apparatus, but if someone asks how deep it was, I should be\
  \ ready to provide that answer without them even needing to ask. For that question,\
  \ they can just look at the picture and get that themselves. Similarly, with a lot\
  \ of the methods, that's often where you put details that you wouldn't necessarily\
  \ say. You could mention, \"Oh yeah, we have this rat doing this thing in this maze,\"\
  \ but the details are there so the person can just kind of skim them and understand\
  \ the answer. I will say that there should be some kind of methods section, which\
  \ should include a visual representation of what you actually did in the study.\
  \ This is a good example because I know, by looking at this, that you examined mice\
  \ in a water bucket with a camera. You could easily have skipped this type of information,\
  \ saying, \"Oh yeah, you have this with a camera,\" and I know there were three\
  \ conditions: one was a sham, meaning they didn't do anything; one was injured;\
  \ and one was whatever this condition is. Now I have a sense of what it is that\
  \ you actually did. \n\nIt's really easy, when you know something too well, to skip\
  \ the parts. I call it skipping Step Zero. The immediate questions that anyone coming\
  \ in would ask are often the first things you forget to explain when you get into\
  \ the details. For example, you can show the results, but I could be halfway into\
  \ my conversation, and then the person asks, \"Wait, are these mice, are they rats,\
  \ are they fruit flies, are they on a treadmill, are these C. elegans?\" They start\
  \ asking questions that show it\u2019s clear they don\u2019t even know basic aspects\
  \ of what I did, which was standing in a room with mice in a water bath. \n\nTherefore,\
  \ the methods section should always include something that clearly explains what\
  \ that is. In my preference, this is typically figure one in whatever paper you're\
  \ looking at. This isn't always the case, but I think this is true for papers as\
  \ well. Figure one or something very close to figure one should be some kind of\
  \ picture that clarifies what you're actually doing, and the results should have\
  \ some representation of the data that was recorded. Generally, you want there to\
  \ be some nice harmony here. \n\nThis is also typically where it's your job to choose\
  \ the most important data. For many papers\u2014and certainly for numerous studies\u2014\
  you produce a lot of data and various visualizations showing different aspects related\
  \ to the data you recorded. Whatever paper you choose could have five, six, ten,\
  \ or more figures of data in it, but your job is to understand what the main figure\
  \ is, what the main result is. If I can only show one or two results from this,\
  \ you have to figure out what those are. In your paper, the results should support\
  \ the conclusions, and keep your directions clear if that is appropriate for the\
  \ study itself. The introduction is typically an explanation of why the study was\
  \ conducted. This section is where you can include citations, indicating, for example,\
  \ that you conducted the study in relation to another study with different findings.\
  \ You might say that previous papers suggested a certain effect is true, and therefore\
  \ you conducted this study to test that effect. Breaking the study down into research\
  \ questions and hypotheses is fine, but it is not necessary for every study. It\u2019\
  s important to delineate those elements if they are present.\n\nThen, include a\
  \ method section that describes what you did, followed by a data representation\
  \ that highlights the main results. Finally, provide a conclusion that reflects\
  \ what you believe to be true based on the study. This part articulates the new\
  \ proposed fact about the world that your research suggests. You should hope that\
  \ after going through this journey, the readers will also believe your conclusions,\
  \ agreeing that the ideas you present seem reasonable and well-supported. If enough\
  \ people are convinced by your narrative, it may become considered a \"scientific\
  \ fact,\" which should always be approached with caution, as scientific facts can\
  \ be proven wrong over time. Nevertheless, we strive to do our best at the moment.\n\
  \nGenerally speaking, you'll rarely read a poster to someone directly. If it\u2019\
  s your poster, don\u2019t read it aloud\u2014find another way to engage with your\
  \ audience. The intention behind the poster is to ensure that if someone reads it\
  \ from start to finish, they will understand the story you are attempting to convey.\
  \ During your actual presentation, the poster serves as an aid for you in explaining\
  \ your work. It helps you remember what you need to discuss and provides you with\
  \ data to reference. This process entails using representative data, which is strategically\
  \ selected data highlighted in your presentation, along with some measure of the\
  \ statistical analysis conducted on that data. As a researcher, you have the responsibility\
  \ to ensure that you are trustworthy and that your methods are credible. Appropriately\
  \ documented, you are allowed to look at the big body of data that you have and\
  \ pick a particular recording that is representative of what you're trying to show.\
  \ In this case, they put mice in a water bucket, and then they had to learn where\
  \ the platform was so they could get out of the water. In our case, we were doing\
  \ tasks like the jumping task or the standing task. For the standing task, we recorded\
  \ 25 different participants, and each of them did 10 different repetitions, which\
  \ amounts to around 200 trials. You can go in and pick one trial or even one section\
  \ of one trial that exemplifies the effect you\u2019re trying to show. Then, clean\
  \ that up and state that it represents data from a subject in the participant study.\
  \ However, without additional support, this is anecdotal; you are merely picking\
  \ one from a set of a thousand options and saying this is the one that looks like\
  \ the story you\u2019re trying to tell. That's not really evidence on its own. Therefore,\
  \ you want to back that up by having some kind of statistical measure that looks\
  \ at all 1,000 trials you conducted, appropriately comparing subjects to subjects\
  \ and conditions to conditions. This is where you start having statistical power\
  \ and statistically supported statements. This data provides the real grounding\
  \ for knowledge generation. It is beneficial to pair both approaches because the\
  \ representative subject data helps to clarify your points, whereas the statistical\
  \ data shows that this is a phenomenon that occurs in general. However, results\
  \ will always vary based on the studies that you are conducting.\n\nYou will want\
  \ to see posters. Generally, if you walk around a department in the school, you\
  \ will see posters on the walls. People typically display their favorite posters\
  \ outside their labs. You can walk around and take a look at what they look like,\
  \ getting a sense of the various styles available and the choices made. You will\
  \ observe some posters with a lot of words and others with very few. I recommend\
  \ just doing that\u2014take whatever hours you want to walk through the different\
  \ departments of the school, and you will typically find posters on the walls that\
  \ you can examine. Different conferences have different poster sizes. I've attended\
  \ some where the posters are 6 feet by 4 feet, which is very large, and others where\
  \ they're 3 feet by 3 feet, which is very small. I want to say that our posters\
  \ are 24 by 36 inches, which is about this big, but I can't recall for certain.\
  \ I'll look that up because it's relevant information to have. However, this primarily\
  \ affects the font size you use. Again, with the vector scale stuff, the actual\
  \ size shouldn't matter too much. You want to ensure that the font size is readable\
  \ and not oppressive. \n\nAlso, just Google \"scientific poster,\" and you'll find\
  \ a lot of examples. There are many layers of explication and tutorials on how to\
  \ create a good poster, which will all be relevant here. The exception is that you\
  \ won't be writing the paper yourself; a lot of this will involve copy-pasting from\
  \ the paper itself. Just get the figure and put it up; then, the section in the\
  \ bottom right will be where you put your citations, which will be generated from\
  \ Zotero or whatever else you choose. \n\nSo, we will go through this together.\
  \ The poster needs to be uploaded by Tuesday, March 25th. This means you'll upload\
  \ a PDF that will then be printed. I believe they charge around twenty dollars for\
  \ this, but I can't remember the exact amount\u2014I will find that number out as\
  \ well. The upload is due on Monday, two weeks before the actual poster session.\
  \ This is mostly because the printing office handles hundreds of posters for the\
  \ course, so we want to ensure they have enough lead time to get everything done,\
  \ in case anything goes wrong. There will be instructions provided on how to do\
  \ that and all the necessary details. Additionally, I'll drop these into the Discord\
  \ server before I post them elsewhere. Canvas is available. Please load up any questions\
  \ or confusions. Okay, so I create my poster on one paper. I just do that on paper.\
  \ Are there any others? Not really. The base level assignment\u2014so they had a\
  \ couple. Was that they only reference it in the introduction? I'm actually looking\
  \ for that because I can't see where these citations actually happen in the poster.\
  \ I guess this might be something I can't remember. So I would actually say this\
  \ may have just been incorrectly done because you're supposed to cite stuff here.\
  \ But again, for this assignment, it's a little bit weird. The default assumption\
  \ is that there's only going to be one citation here, and it's the citation of the\
  \ actual paper where you got the information from. I would still say you should\
  \ cite it somewhere, either in the introduction or in the conclusions, stating something\
  \ like, 'this study did this.' You just have the one citation, like CH et al., 2018,\
  \ cited somewhere in the text. So the default assumption is that it's just the one\
  \ paper. It\u2019s also the case that as you go into your paper, there might be\
  \ some other obvious choices to cite. For instance, future directions could mention\
  \ follow-up studies that were done after this that should be cited. In their introduction,\
  \ they might say they're doing this because of that other paper, and then you can\
  \ cite that one too. If you find there's a method used that you don't understand\
  \ and you go find a review article explaining how that method works and how it's\
  \ used, that\u2019s a good thing to include as a citation somewhere in your development\
  \ of the poster. Citations in this context are often used as a sort of rubric\u2014\
  like you must have this many to make it valid. But that's not how we use it in the\
  \ real world. You cite stuff that you've used to understand all the work in this\
  \ poster that I'm presenting and the research I'm presenting. I am building this\
  \ study and this knowledge on the basis of the materials that I have read before.\
  \ I am constructing this on other people's work, and because of that, I need to\
  \ cite it. If you are trying to determine whether you should trust the resource\
  \ that I am presenting, I must inform you that the information I am providing relies\
  \ on work that has come before me, and this is that work. Hypothetically, if you\
  \ truly do not trust someone when they present their data to you, you can go back\
  \ and review all the sources they depend on. This is where the concept of citation\
  \ networks comes into play. Any study that has a certain number of citations allows\
  \ you to navigate through other studies, facilitating exploration of all the empirical\
  \ work that has been conducted since, at least, the 1800s when tracking this kind\
  \ of information began.\n\nFor the strict assignment, it is just one requirement.\
  \ In general, when it comes to posters, the citation process is less formal. Posters\
  \ are usually treated as a more informal type of presentation. Not always, but some\
  \ conferences take them quite seriously. However, for those that do, the posters\
  \ are typically paired with a paper. For instance, you write a six-page paper to\
  \ accompany a poster, and the poster itself is generally printed just for the conference\
  \ as a tool for discussion. They usually do not enter the official records of a\
  \ scientific society or similar formal archives. Hence, they are often treated as\
  \ much more informal.\n\nThe actual, proper review process takes place at the level\
  \ of articles and papers. Does that make sense? Are there any other questions, thoughts,\
  \ or feelings? Cool. I will ensure to plan some time in this two-week period, likely\
  \ at the beginning of this week. I will schedule something in this timeframe to\
  \ practice your poster. I will try to do it the week before it is due because often,\
  \ after creating the poster, you start explaining it and realize that it does not\
  \ reflect what you intended at all. We can conduct some kind of practice session.\
  \ The demo run will probably take place this week, so you'll have a chance to go\
  \ through it with your peers before presenting it in person. It is also absolutely\
  \ standard experience that when you're presenting a poster for the first time, the\
  \ first couple of people you present it to get the worst version of the story. Generally\
  \ speaking, by the end of the session\u2014which can last three to four hours for\
  \ a lot of conferences\u2014you will have the story of your research down perfectly.\
  \ If you ever find yourself going to a conference and presenting a poster, I urge\
  \ you to do yourself the favor of taking notes\u2014voice notes, text notes, whatever\
  \ you can\u2014about what you've been discussing in your poster, right after the\
  \ poster session. The story you're trying to tell will never be clearer in your\
  \ mind than it is after you\u2019ve gone through it multiple times.\n\nThis is relevant\
  \ within the context of how science operates, particularly from a practical, communal\
  \ perspective. Often, the purpose of a poster session is not just to present finished\
  \ work, but to refine your message. Most of the time, when you're presenting at\
  \ a conference, you're discussing work that is still in progress. Depending on the\
  \ timeline, ideally, you should be presenting things that are not quite finished\
  \ yet, meaning they aren't published or peer-reviewed, but rather the paper that\
  \ you're currently writing. The poster session, in particular, is a really great\
  \ opportunity to hone the story you're telling.\n\nWhen you\u2019re discussing your\
  \ methods, for instance, you might describe it a certain way initially, and people\
  \ don\u2019t really grasp it. Then, you might find a turn of phrase that gives clarity,\
  \ making it understandable to everyone. That\u2019s the way you want to articulate\
  \ what you're doing. It's very common, especially for graduate students, to initially\
  \ provide too much detail. Over time, you'll learn which details can be omitted\
  \ to help your audience understand the core message with minimal time investment.\
  \ This skill is crucial as you develop your presentation abilities, especially early\
  \ on in your academic career when you start presenting research. The amount of time\
  \ spent discussing a particular area is proportional to the amount of time that\
  \ was spent working on that area. However, that's almost never what you should do.\
  \ It's possible that whoever these people are spent a good four to five months trying\
  \ to figure out how to stop the water from leaking out of the stupid thing. They\
  \ kept using something that wasn't working until they finally figured out the glue,\
  \ and then after that, the data just kind of fell out of it. When they give the\
  \ presentation, they're going to spend the first half of the conversation talking\
  \ about all the glue they had to use and how they managed to get the water up to\
  \ the right level. That part shouldn't even be a part of the conversation. Sometimes\
  \ when I'm giving a presentation, I simply say, 'This slide transition was six months\
  \ of my life,' and then I just show the result where it worked, omitting the fifteen\
  \ iterations of failed attempts that I had to go through before I got the version\
  \ that worked. If the things you did to make it work are interesting, you might\
  \ want to document them elsewhere, but a poster is almost never the right time for\
  \ that. There may be a case where someone asks, 'How did you get your stupid thing\
  \ to fill up? Ours keeps leaking.' That's when you can say, 'Oh yeah, we used this\
  \ glue and not the other glue.' You can include a very long methods section in the\
  \ paper you publish, where you can explain why you had to use this glue and not\
  \ the other one. The process of distillation is really the crux of this assignment.\
  \ It is your job, as the ambassador of this research study, to make the judgment\
  \ call about what's the most important part and what narrative we're trying to pursue\
  \ here. Okay, are we good? Cool. We will have plenty of opportunities to talk about\
  \ this in your specific cases. Now, with all that said, let's look at a paper. We\
  \ have approximately forty minutes left, and I'm going to attempt to examine two\
  \ separate papers, which may not be the best idea because I've already mentioned\
  \ this is going to have an 'and' in the lecture. However, I love the papers I'm\
  \ discussing and I really want to dive deeply into them. Nonetheless, I think it's\
  \ fun to do the quick. Run through. So, we'll do that, and I'll try to keep myself\
  \ to a particular time. I will also finish up a thought I meant to have about half\
  \ an hour ago. After we do this sort of aside around the papers, the assignment,\
  \ and the exam object, we're going to transition into vision stuff, like eyeballs.\
  \ I'll bring in an eye tracker, and we'll talk more about visual neuroscience. I\
  \ will record semi-tracking data, similar to how we did before. It's going to have\
  \ a bit of a different vibe there, just because of the nature of the equipment and\
  \ the data. But we're going to do vision stuff, which is always fun. Vision, and\
  \ specifically eye movements, which are technically a part of motor control because\
  \ it involves muscles, but it's an interesting space there. Okay, so in 20 minutes\
  \ or less, which will put us at 4:10, I'm going to look up C prot CPG, which is\
  \ one of those things I forgot for that moment. Storing volary, there we go. In\
  \ 2012, this used to be a new study; now it's old. That's not that old; it's just\
  \ over a decade at this point. So, this is a paper published in Science, which is\
  \ one of the bigger journals out there. There are two journals that are categorically\
  \ the biggest and most prestigious: Science and Nature. That sort of cultural reality\
  \ of having a biggest thing is generally toxic and leads to a lot of bad outcomes.\
  \ Nonetheless, if you see something published in Science or Nature, that's a good\
  \ and prestigious study. Generally speaking, the more generic the name of the journal\
  \ is, the more prestigious it is. So, the Portuguese Study of Ankle Prosthetics\
  \ Research is generally going to be of lower prestige than the Journal of Prosthetics,\
  \ which will be lower prestige than the Journal of Biology, which leads to Science\
  \ and Nature being about as big as you can get in that space. Also, Cell is a very\
  \ good journal for biology.\n\nBecause we are on campus, I can just download this\
  \ here, but for fun, we're going to go to Scub and input it that way. I'm using\
  \ this dark reader tool, so I'll turn that off for a normal look. I have about 15\
  \ minutes to go through this; I probably won\u2019t get to a second article, but\
  \ we\u2019ll see. This is kind of normal. When you download the PDF, the front page\
  \ is just kind of like information about the study: title, author list, journal,\
  \ etc. There are links to things like supporting material and other references that\
  \ cite this article. With modern papers, typically there's going to be supplemental\
  \ data or supplemental methods and so forth. Modern contemporary journal articles\
  \ tend to have very constrained lengths, so the core studies are typically going\
  \ to be quite short. Unless it's like a journal review or an older paper, that all\
  \ varies very much by journal. To kind of get around that, they'll often have supplemental\
  \ materials, so, like, either the methods will not be a part of the word count or\
  \ you have the opportunity to present additional data there. What I'm going to do\
  \ now with this study, because I know this study quite well, is give you a high-level\
  \ overview of this paper that ideally will be fast enough to cover in the next 15\
  \ minutes, comprehensible enough for you to follow the story despite not being particularly\
  \ trained in this area, and ideally a fair and honest representation of what was\
  \ actually done. This way, if you took the time to read the paper in depth and get\
  \ through all the nitty-gritty, you would come out of it saying, \"Oh yeah, everything\
  \ that John said about this is an accurate representation.\" I'm creating a cartoon\
  \ narrative of the study so that I can present it in a way that will stand on its\
  \ own. If you became an expert in this area and on this paper, ideally you would\
  \ be able to evaluate my choices of cartoonification and understand why I chose\
  \ this form of explanation and not some other. This study is about the spinal cord;\
  \ in particular, it's looking at spinal cord injury and trying to address something\
  \ like what has been a sort of Holy Grail type of issue for quite some time: the\
  \ ability to heal spinal cord injuries. When you experience an injury or get into\
  \ an accident that damages your spinal cord, you may lose control of your limbs\
  \ below that area. You might lose control of your legs or even your whole body,\
  \ depending on where that injury occurs. We would really like it if we could correct\
  \ that in some way, similar to how we can heal a broken ankle or repair damaged\
  \ muscles or skin. This paper presents the abstract; different journals format this\
  \ in various ways. This journal doesn't even label it as the abstract; they assume\
  \ you know that. Sometimes it might be called a summary or referred to by something\
  \ else. I noticed that on the actual website they're... Giving a sort of high-level\
  \ summary in addition to the abstract, all the information should, really speaking,\
  \ be there. This study builds on the application in the space of trying to heal\
  \ spinal cord injury. However, this study is not looking at patient populations;\
  \ they are not looking at people who have spinal cord injuries. They are looking\
  \ specifically at rats. If you look at any of these numbers here, they are the citations,\
  \ and if you scroll to the end of the paper, they will correspond to the actual\
  \ citations. These are in science format. Sometimes you\u2019ll see citations in\
  \ the format of author-year, like Mathis et al. 2019, which is APA format. This\
  \ is a more engineering style, literally made to be shorter. If you look at these\
  \ citations, they will reference clinical studies and medical studies, but they\
  \ are not themselves doing research on humans. This is an application with a basic\
  \ science motivation where they are trying to increase theoretical understanding,\
  \ but they are doing it in service of being able to move towards this applied goal.\
  \ They are building on a history of studies of Central Pattern Generators in mammals.\
  \ Those Central Pattern Generators exist in pretty much all animals, not necessarily\
  \ all animals, but many. They generally refer to neural architectures that generate\
  \ rhythmic activation, which is some sort of metronome type of activity, the basis\
  \ of a lot of motor behavior and general life. This is a really fun animation of\
  \ an ant walking with an alternating tripod gait. The red represents one tripod,\
  \ and the blue represents another tripod. This is how insects operate, and that\u2019\
  s a rhythmic behavior. Breathing is a rhythmic behavior; most forms of locomotion\
  \ and flapping are rhythmic behaviors. It\u2019s the kind of thing that is present\
  \ down to invertebrates like insects and also present up to mammals like us. Spinal\
  \ central pattern generators, or CPGs, in cats, and this particular study follows\
  \ a specific branch of ways to study the idea of central pattern generators as they\
  \ exist in the spines of invertebrates. There is a general question surrounding\
  \ the presence of CPGs in lower animals. We can study them very carefully in those\
  \ animals because they are simpler; we can open them up and observe these processes\
  \ occurring. However, this raises the question of what role these types of neural\
  \ architectures play in more complex animals, like mammals, which have many more\
  \ neurons and exhibit more complex behaviors, yet share a similar evolutionary history.\n\
  \nThis is a video that is quite old, representing a different era regarding animal\
  \ rights. It shows a cat that has been decerebrated. It is difficult to see, but\
  \ this is the cat being supported by these wires. The cat has had its spinal cord\
  \ severed; the brain is here, the cerebellum is here, and then we have the spine\
  \ and the legs. During this era, they would surgically cut the spinal cord to prevent\
  \ any information from reaching or coming from the legs to the brain. The legs remain\
  \ connected to the spinal cord.\n\nThe interesting result here is that if the cat\
  \ is supported and walking on a treadmill, its hind limbs still engage in rhythmic\
  \ locomotion. They continue walking due to the sensory-motor loops functioning from\
  \ the feet through the spine and back. This outcome challenges much of our intuition\
  \ about how the spine works; we often think of it merely as extension cables leading\
  \ from the brain down to the muscles. The type of information shows that there is\
  \ processing happening in the spinal cord, which is a part of the central nervous\
  \ system. It can handle simple tasks, such as the sensory information coming from\
  \ the feet. This information is enough to generate the behavior that allows the\
  \ feet to move. For instance, if I'm being pushed backwards, at a certain point,\
  \ I should lift up, go forward, and come down again. The two limbs are reciprocally\
  \ activated by central pattern generators in the spine. This means that a cat can\
  \ walk despite having no cerebral implant in its spine for the back legs. As the\
  \ treadmill speeds up, the cat speeds up as well. Just think about that; it seems\
  \ perturbing and feels wrong. It\u2019s a wild result, and it absolutely is baffling\
  \ on many levels. This is why I enjoy studying this so much. Often, in empirical\
  \ investigations, we encounter unexpected results that lead to the best discoveries.\
  \ Despite the strangeness of this study, it is also well-established; we've known\
  \ for quite some time about these central pattern generators that govern movement.\
  \ They handle basic trade-offs, such as the limbs transitioning from stance to swing.\
  \ Active areas of research have been focused on understanding these spinal central\
  \ pattern generators\u2014how they operate and the connection between the brain,\
  \ the upper level of the brain, and the lower level of the spine, including the\
  \ peripheral nerves. Over time, there have been changes in animal rights regulations.\
  \ At some point, it was decided that cats should no longer be used in certain types\
  \ of research. The rules regarding animal ethics have evolved... It's interesting\
  \ and complicated. I'll talk about them at some point, but there are rules about\
  \ which animal you're allowed to use for which study. There are some strange designations\
  \ for higher-level versus lower-level animals. Typically speaking, the closer you\
  \ get to a human-like animal, the more stringent the standards are. We do still\
  \ use non-human primates for neuroscience research, but we don't use apes and chimpanzees.\
  \ If you want to conduct monkey research, you really have to justify that the research\
  \ needs to be done on a non-human primate. At some point, it was decided that you\
  \ can't do it on cats anymore, so similar research is now conducted with rats. This\
  \ particular study was done with rats. By the way, there is a really fun TED Talk\
  \ about it, where Greg Lut presents in a very smarmy French style, which is a good\
  \ presentation if you can get past the typical TED Talk format. He does a good job\
  \ of telling an interesting story. However, the way he tells his story is not the\
  \ same as how I tell mine. I want to point out that I am narrating this story as\
  \ I have internalized it; I am a particular individual scientist with a specific\
  \ background and area of the world I\u2019m trying to make sense of. When I tell\
  \ you the story about this paper, it will differ from how the authors of the study\
  \ would tell it or how someone with a different background and interest would present\
  \ it. There\u2019s this context of narrative that keeps coming up, which feels unexpected\
  \ in discussions about scientific empirical studies. Remember, this research is\
  \ all being conducted by humans, and we only remember stories that make sense to\
  \ us. I\u2019m going to highlight a particular aspect of this study that I found\
  \ motivating. Since I have a little more time, I also want to discuss the structure\
  \ of this paper. These are all the authors of the paper, and they all contributed\
  \ in some way. The person at the front is the first author, who typically serves\
  \ as the owner of the project\u2014generally a graduate student or a postdoctoral\
  \ researcher. The last author is often the senior author, which is common, though\
  \ not always the case. This can be somewhat field-dependent, but in most biology-related\
  \ neuroscience studies, the last author is typically the person who runs the lab\
  \ where the study was conducted. The first author is typically the person in the\
  \ lab who did most of the work. However, this can vary dramatically by paper, by\
  \ field, and by other factors. If you are in graduate school or a postdoc, you will\
  \ be considering your first author publications differently from your non-first\
  \ author publications. The middle authors are typically individuals who contributed\
  \ in some way but were not the primary researchers of the study.\n\nOnce you start\
  \ publishing papers, people will begin asking you questions about how many first\
  \ author publications you have compared to second author publications. Typically,\
  \ you will have more second author publications than first author publications.\
  \ When you reach the point of running a lab, people will start asking about how\
  \ many last author publications you have, which indicates whether you are effectively\
  \ training others in the work.\n\nThis is very field dependent. For instance, mathematicians\
  \ publish their papers with authors listed alphabetically, which I find quite interesting.\
  \ What I am describing here reflects standard cultural practices in contemporary\
  \ scientific publishing.\n\nIn the citations, you will see numbers corresponding\
  \ to where the work was completed, often indicating that most of the work was done\
  \ in Switzerland. There may also be a notation indicating that certain authors contributed\
  \ equally to the work, though I can assure you that discussions about who gets to\
  \ be first author often take place despite these notations.\n\nAnother important\
  \ aspect is the corresponding author. This symbol indicates that if you have questions\
  \ about the paper, you should contact this specific author. You will find this typically\
  \ included as well.\n\nFinally, from a structural perspective, there is always going\
  \ to be an acknowledgment section somewhere in the paper, where authors thank individuals\
  \ who helped with specific aspects of the work. They should also cite their funding\
  \ sources, indicating where the money came from. In this case, they list several\
  \ grants from European research councils. This illustrates the often expensive funding\
  \ processes, and there will generally be acknowledgments such as thanking the NIH\
  \ for providing grants or other financial support. Typically, this is another place\
  \ where you say, \"Hey, thanks for giving me this grant,\" and you mention the grant\
  \ number. For public grants, which most of these are, you can look up the grant\
  \ that was written to fund this research and see what they were discussing. This\
  \ is just another way that people stay connected to the larger community when publishing\
  \ particular papers. Modern papers also tend to include sections that list out what\
  \ each author contributed. For example, one author might have helped collect the\
  \ data while another wrote the manuscript. There will usually be a paragraph or\
  \ two detailing what each author did to earn their spot on the author list.\n\n\
  Now, regarding this particular study, this is your Figure One. This style of figure\
  \ is very common in journals like Science and Nature because those journals are\
  \ very short and dense. Specifically, this is a report, which generally means the\
  \ journal has articles that are full-length and reports that are of shorter length,\
  \ as well as brief communications that fall somewhere in between. This particular\
  \ report is not the longest format; it's in a shorter form. The entire study is\
  \ five pages long, including the front page, so there are only four pages of written\
  \ text. When you look at the supplemental documents, they will typically resemble\
  \ a Microsoft Word document that has been converted to PDF and can comprise dozens\
  \ of pages.\n\nThis study features a figure that is very dense, with numerous sub-panels\
  \ and includes a professional-looking animation or visualization, which is very\
  \ indicative of this type of journal. In contrast, if you go to more standard journals,\
  \ like the Journal of Biomechanics or any other specific journal, the figures will\
  \ generally appear as if a regular person made them rather than a professional graphics\
  \ design team, which is the case here. When I look at a new paper, I will examine\
  \ the title and check who wrote it to see if I recognize any names or where they\
  \ are working. I read the abstract and then skim the paper. I usually start by looking\
  \ at the figures. I typically do not sit down with a new paper and read it from\
  \ start to finish like it's a novel; that's not how we usually interrogate scientific\
  \ papers. It\u2019s kind of like JPEG compression\u2014you skim at different levels\
  \ to get the full picture and then choose to zone in on different levels of analysis\
  \ and parts of the paper. Science is not clickbait. When we write a good paper,\
  \ the title is a summary, the abstract is a summary, and then the paper contains\
  \ repetitive summaries within it.\n\nSo we\u2019re going to look at this; this is\
  \ figure one, which will be referenced in the article somewhere. Figure S1 is a\
  \ supplemental figure. They are even citing figures that are not in the main article;\
  \ you have to go to the supplemental information to get the results. But this is\
  \ the first one I\u2019m seeing. Figure 1C represents this figure, and the letters\
  \ correspond to sections. The figure will always have a caption, which includes\
  \ a one-sentence summary of what we\u2019re looking at, and then each lettered subsection\
  \ has a little write-up of what\u2019s going on in that section.\n\nGenerally, figure\
  \ one should always be a methods figure, and it should ideally have representative\
  \ data. This one is doing both; it serves as both a methods figure and a representation\
  \ of representative data. Now, looking at what they were actually doing here: they\
  \ are examining central pattern generators in mammals, specifically in rats, as\
  \ they use rats for this study. Their model organism is not focused on rats; they\
  \ are using rats as a proxy animal. They believe that rats have sufficient complexity\
  \ that, if we learn something about how something works in a rat, it will be helpful\
  \ in developing a treatment for humans. I happen to know that, if you look at what\
  \ this researcher has been up to recently, they have been able to apply these findings\
  \ in humans. I think they are actually getting to the point where they are restoring\
  \ voluntary control of locomotion after a paralyzed spinal cord injury. I haven't\
  \ checked in on them in a couple of years, I guess, but this researcher is one of\
  \ those leading figures in the field. If you go to the Society for Neuroscience\
  \ (SFN) meeting, he has several rows of people working in his lab. It\u2019s like\
  \ a business owner type of scenario, which creates a very different vibe than a\
  \ lab like mine that has just three people in it. I wouldn't want to run a lab like\
  \ that; it sounds overwhelming.\n\nSo, the idea was, they took the rats and gave\
  \ them a surgical spinal cord injury. They performed the surgery and created an\
  \ injury that damaged their spine and severed all the fibers going to their brain.\
  \ This is a picture of the central nervous system of a rat. These are the two lobes\
  \ of the brain, and the spinal cord itself is represented here. The clever part\
  \ of their approach is that instead of making a single cut across the spine, they\
  \ made two cuts: one at about 60% of the way through the spine and then a little\
  \ bit below, creating another cut. This way, all of the fibers that go through this\
  \ section are severed, but they are not completely removing tissue. There is still\
  \ hypothetically a path for the fibers to regrow and reconnect. If it were possible\
  \ for these fibers to kind of regrow and reform, then you could theoretically have\
  \ recovery potential. A signal comes from here and bypasses these injury points,\
  \ getting back up to the brain. The idea was that this process is similar to what\
  \ was shown in the cat video. They performed surgery on these rats, using a scalpel\
  \ to make cuts in certain areas. In the study, an adult rat received a left lateral\
  \ hemisection at thoracic vertebrae T7 and a right lateral hemisection at T10. If\
  \ you understand the terminology, you can see that \u2018hemisection\u2019 means\
  \ slightly more than half, indicating they went beyond the halfway point. \n\nThey\
  \ then placed the rat in this little robotic gait entry system. This system resembles\
  \ the 2012 version of the wire support and treadmill setup used in the cat study.\
  \ Essentially, they were able to create a mechanism similar to a 3D printer, where\
  \ the motor control moves over a two-dimensional plane and then lowers to provide\
  \ support. It supports the rat's partial body weight, ensuring it is not completely\
  \ off the ground, nor does it bear its full body weight. This setup allows the rat\
  \ to turn while maintaining body weight support. It consistently detects what is\
  \ happening and ensures the rat has 10 to 20 percent of its body weight on the ground.\
  \ As a result, we are not surprised to learn that even after these modifications...\
  \ The activity is held upright so it walks in a bipedal way, which would be cute\
  \ if it weren't so mob-like. This is what intact means: not chopped up. The intact\
  \ animal's behavior looks like this. The trajectories in blue here represent the\
  \ trajectories of the feet. We are not shocked to learn that even after an injury,\
  \ they can still walk decently, okay? If you put them in a little robotic device\
  \ and drag them along, they can walk just fine. There's a complicated electrochemical\
  \ process that they incorporate into their spine to ensure that the neurons remain\
  \ active and healthy, firing hard enough to move the limbs. What they found with\
  \ those cats is that, even though the video you saw was probably right after the\
  \ surgery was done, typically, the behaviors extinguish over time. After a couple\
  \ of hours or days, and I think no more than weeks, the cat would stop demonstrating\
  \ that behavior, and if you put it back on the treadmill, it would just kind of\
  \ wind up dragging its feet. One of the results they built on from their own lab\
  \ involved creating a combination of a pharmaceutical cocktail and a specific electrical\
  \ stimulation pattern. This allows them to keep the deactivated animals performing\
  \ this movement for a sort of arbitrary amount of time. So, that's the main setup.\
  \ We have these deactivated animals that can perform this walking task, which is\
  \ good for them. However, while all of this is cool, none of it is shocking; this\
  \ is all stuff we already knew when we showed the cat video. The specific goal they\
  \ are trying to achieve is to restore the animals' ability to initiate walking.\
  \ Much of the previous work involved dragging them along on a treadmill so they\
  \ receive the necessary stimulus\u2014the dragging of the feet leads to sensory\
  \ signals that prompt them to take steps. However, the rat cannot just sit there\
  \ and decide to start walking forward. They are trying to restore that ability.\
  \ There's a lot going on in terms of methodology, which has too much depth for me\
  \ to go into, but I will say they then divided the animals into two groups. One\
  \ of the groups of animals was in the control condition, which involved training.\
  \ They would perform surgery on them and provide them with an electrochemical prosthetic\
  \ that allows them to continue walking. Then, they would put them in a robotic suit\
  \ and have them complete movement training, taking a series of steps in a row. The\
  \ other group, which is where the main interesting point of the paper comes in,\
  \ also underwent a matched amount of training, taking the same number of steps.\
  \ However, before they began the robotic assistance, the researchers would place\
  \ chocolate in front of their faces, as rats apparently enjoy chocolate. Seeing\
  \ the chocolate, the rats would express their desire to it, and then the robot would\
  \ pull them forward, prompting them to perform the stepping behavior. After completing\
  \ the task, they were rewarded by being allowed to eat the chocolate that had been\
  \ presented. Thus, we have two matched groups of rats: one was trained and performed\
  \ steps using the robotic gantry system, while the other completed the same steps\
  \ but received a motivating food reward for their actions. In the last two minutes\
  \ of class, if we examine the results closely, we find that the animals who only\
  \ engaged in the basic training did not improve; eventually, their behavior became\
  \ extinguished, and they never regained their capabilities. In contrast, the animals\
  \ that were rewarded with chocolate experienced a kind of regrowth pattern. Over\
  \ time, they began to form connections that bypassed the injury site. Eventually,\
  \ they would see the chocolate and could initiate the stepping behavior on their\
  \ own, before the robotic gantry pulled them forward. I think that is truly amazing.\
  \ This process taps into how we move our bodies in the world. It wasn't enough for\
  \ the control rats to continue stepping, as it lacked connection to their environment.\
  \ Conversely, those in the chocolate condition had the experience of seeing something\
  \ desirable in the world\u2014something in front of them that they wanted. They\
  \ needed to walk to reach it. As they began walking, unaware they were being assisted\
  \ by a robot, they eventually got to eat the chocolate. This scenario triggers the\
  \ concept of the dopaminergic reward system, where the brain is flooded with reward\
  \ chemicals, primarily dopamine, alongside other substances that contribute to this\
  \ process. It has the effect of reinforcing all the neurons that were just firing.\
  \ The dopaminergic reward system is kind of how that works. So, it's that connection\
  \ between that frontal area, that volitional sort of prefrontal cortex aspect, where\
  \ you think, \"I wish I was over there so I could eat the chocolate.\" Then a bunch\
  \ of neural activity happens, you get to eat the chocolate, and your brain gets\
  \ flooded with neurons that say, \"Whatever was just happening, reinforce that.\"\
  \ This is enough to trigger the regrowth of neurons at the spinal level. That is\
  \ as much as I'm going to say about this paper. End of class, so thanks for following\
  \ along, and I'll see you all on Wednesday. We're going to discuss two papers. Someday\

    \ to get some stuff downloaded that I should have done at home. So, standard check-in:\
    \ we are officially in week number six, which is a fine place to be. We have covered\
    \ a lot of material; I would say we've covered the majority of the hardcore biomechanics\
    \ content. I almost said the motor control stuff, but I will probably get back\
    \ to that later.\n\nThis week, we are going to take a little bit of time to discuss\
    \ some examples of published papers\u2014something that I really like. I have\
    \ some experience going through a published article and trying to make sense of\
    \ it. Then, on Wednesday, we'll have a small group assignment to help you all\
    \ prepare for the exam, which is related to the SL poster proposal. Both of these\
    \ will be due at the end of this week, probably next week.\n\nSo, I initially\
    \ got these dates wrong; I will fix that later. The idea is that at this point,\
    \ I have talked about some of the topic areas, usually in the review. We have\
    \ spent a good amount of time collecting data in class and sort of eyeballing\
    \ it\u2014looking through it and trying to figure out what kind of stories could\
    \ be told from it. We came in with some basic hypotheses and things like that.\n\
    \nFor the next two periods, which will be three classes since next Monday is a\
    \ holiday, I want to prepare you all to start thinking about your own chosen topic,\
    \ whatever that happens to be. We will use the thought processes and mental frameworks\
    \ that I have been discussing in the context of human body and human movement\
    \ research based on kinematic motion capture data. So, starting to dig into the\
    \ topic area you've chosen and thinking more deeply about it is where we are headed."

    \ know that the way we gathered that information was a combination of discussing\
    \ topics and also selecting a paper. The paper part is, technically, the most\
    \ relevant component to the poster proposal, but I want to make sure it\u2019\
    s framed in the context of my interest in this topic.\n\nSo, I am trying to flesh\
    \ out the methodologies involved in your area of research\u2014the empirical grounding\
    \ of it. This includes understanding what methodologies are used, what tools are\
    \ utilized to collect relevant data for your topic, and how this connects to the\
    \ conversations we've been having around cameras and motion capture. Specifically,\
    \ what is the core empirical tool involved? What does it measure, and what units\
    \ are derived from it? What are the data types and structures that the scientific\
    \ insights in your area of focus are built upon?\n\nThis will culminate in a follow-up\
    \ proposal\u2014Proposal Number Two\u2014which will be a fleshed-out version of\
    \ the original concept of identifying a paper I care about. I have been considering\
    \ what kind of mechanism to use for this process. I think it will ultimately be\
    \ a base-level assignment that will exist on Canvas and in the GitHub repository.\
    \ This will involve you copy-pasting some text from your profile, which you've\
    \ been generating, into a chat with the bot that will be prompted in the server.\n\
    \nThe idea is that you'll start with the last relevant piece of text you have\
    \ regarding your interests and the paper you've chosen. You will take that into\
    \ a chat space, and the bot will be prompted to ask you about certain layers of\
    \ the methodology we\u2019ve discussed. At the end of that interaction, you'll\
    \ ask for a summary, possibly using a prompt that I will provide. Then you'll\
    \ take that summary and put it into another chat for additional layers of conversation.\n\
    \nThe output of those conversations will resemble the poster proposal, serving\
    \ as a fleshed-out version of what you are examining. The reason for this structure\
    \ is that I considered simply creating one chat, like we've been doing, but this\
    \ approach allows for more depth."

    \ really complicated and enters a space where these types of AI, as implemented\
    \ here, can\u2019t really function effectively. They are not capable of handling\
    \ two-part instructions like \"do this and then do that.\" They are just not set\
    \ up for that. You can set up the code on the back end to handle some tasks automatically,\
    \ but it is much easier to create two versions of the prompt and provide clear\
    \ instructions for intelligent humans that say, \"do this and then do that.\"\
    \ \n\nThe idea is that you'll be preparing yourself for the next conversation,\
    \ which will also give you some experience in directed prompting and that kind\
    \ of AI training. The conversations and prompts I\u2019ve set up for you will\
    \ be based on the lectures I\u2019ve been giving, which are available on the YouTube\
    \ playlist linked in the server. So, I will be doing something that might not\
    \ be obvious to you, such as pulling the transcripts from those lectures, extracting\
    \ the main points, and using that content to guide our discussions. \n\nThat's\
    \ why I am considering that set of chats as an exam-like object where you\u2019\
    ll have specific tasks to complete. If you don\u2019t complete those tasks, you\
    \ will receive a lower grade, and it will be cumulative based on previous activities,\
    \ which I think aligns with the legal definition of a test. \n\nAdditionally,\
    \ this will prepare you for the Proposal Part, which is another requirement in\
    \ this class structure. By this week, my aim is to have you hypothetically ready\
    \ to start working on the actual poster with the level of detail it needs. It\u2019\
    s the lecture material that has delayed me from providing you with anything today.\
    \ I have all that content ready; it\u2019s just that uploading the videos takes\
    \ a long time. I had to wait for the last one to upload, which I just put up this\
    \ morning. I plan to have everything compiled and ready for you by next Wednesday,\
    \ so we can discuss it in class, and you can ask questions and engage further.\
    \ \n\nLeading into that, hypothetically by the end of Week Seven, which is next\
    \ week, I will spend some time discussing the posters themselves. I will upload\
    \ some templates into the server and ensure they are available in the relevant\
    \ location on campus soon. But before I proceed, does anyone have any questions\
    \ so far?"

    \ you would feel more comfortable about your status here. Someone sent me an email\
    \ asking about the poster structure itself, and that's what we're going to talk\
    \ about today. Great, okay. \n\nSo, the poster itself\u2014these are just some\
    \ examples that I found from previous courses taught. This is made more difficult\
    \ because I don't have PowerPoint on this computer, but that's okay. We have that\
    \ one. This is a PowerPoint slide. It is akin to PowerPoint or Google Slides.\
    \ I think it's equivalent to Keynote on Mac. I'm sure a lot of you have PowerPoint\
    \ slides in it. Long story short, the nice thing about something like PowerPoint\
    \ is that it is a vector-based art tool. \n\nThis means that these visuals are\
    \ defined not by pixels on an image\u2014like most images where, if you zoom in\
    \ on them, you start to see the pixels\u2014but rather vector-based graphics are\
    \ not like that. They are defined mathematically. For example, this curve here\
    \ is not defined as a set of dots; it\u2019s defined as a mathematical definition\
    \ of how to draw this shape. Everything on the PowerPoint page is defined in this\
    \ way. \n\nThe advantage is that you can zoom it up infinitely, and you'll never\
    \ see the pixels because it is not based on pixels. The opposite of vector-based\
    \ is raster-based, which applies to most images. If you take a screenshot and\
    \ zoom in, you can only zoom in to the level of the resolution of the image. Therefore,\
    \ most posters are made with a vector-based visualization method. \n\nI would\
    \ say PowerPoint is like the entry-level version of that or an equivalent of PowerPoint.\
    \ For the vast majority of you, I would say almost all of you, except for someone\
    \ who has a really specific interest in design, I recommend using PowerPoint or\
    \ Google Slides. Just create a single page, a single slide that has information\
    \ about your poster. If you're feeling fancy and want to do the professional version\
    \ of this, the main professional vector graphics editor is Adobe Illustrator.\
    \ You all have free access to the Adobe Creative Suite through your Northeastern\
    \ email."

    You can download Creative Cloud and log in with your Northeastern account. However,
    you need to go to a specific website and submit a request for a license. Unfortunately,
    this process takes about a day or two. If you''re interested, you can proceed
    with that.


    There''s also Inkscape, which is a free alternative to Adobe Illustrator. I have
    used it, and it has improved over time. When I was in graduate school, it wasn''t
    very good, and I wouldn''t have considered it a viable alternative. However, I
    think for basic usage, it might be helpful. Just don''t expect it to be at the
    same level as Illustrator. Realistically, if you''re new to this area, you probably
    won''t be using professional-level tools, so giving it a shot might be worthwhile.


    Regardless of what you choose, the work you''ll be doing to prepare the content
    for the poster will be independent of the software you use. If you try something
    fancy and later decide you don''t want to go that route, you can always convert
    it later.


    Now, what should go on the poster itself? A poster is essentially a distillation
    of a paper, which I believe is the best way to think about it for our class. However,
    this doesn''t mean a poster can''t be other things. The default purpose of a poster
    is to represent a particular study, typically one that you are conducting. You
    will take it to a conference, display it, and hope people come by to talk to you
    about it. I showed you some pictures of scientific conference poster sessions,
    which illustrate the structure we are mimicking here.


    At the end of the semester, around the week of April 7th, there will be a poster
    session for all the inquiries classes. You will be assigned one of the days for
    your presentation. You will present your poster alongside half of the students
    from each other class. If you aren''t presenting, your assignment will be to circulate
    and engage with the other posters.'

    \ say it again, there\u2019s the default version of the assignment and then there\u2019\

    \ the other class has specific guidelines on whether you need to role-play as\
    \ a grad student in the lab or if you can just present your paper in the third\
    \ person. But yeah, you also have the option to add more citations if you want\
    \ or talk about other topics. If you want to use any of the data that we covered\
    \ in this class as part of your poster, we can set that up. Basically, any of\

    \ a paper or topic area, how do you actually create a poster? There are instructions\
    \ about that, which I think might include some instructions from other classes.\
    \ The basic idea is that you\u2019re not supposed to include all the information\
    \ from the paper on the poster. You don't want to have what we affectionately\
    \ call a wall of text poster. We all know what it feels like to be confronted\

    \ and never actually show it to anybody else, you're not really doing science.\
    \ You're more like investigating and playing around with data. The process of\
    \ science is fundamentally a process of communication. Presenting a poster or\
    \ writing a paper is the traditional method for communicating science to others.\
    \ Presenting a poster at a conference, in a sense, unofficially counts as a peer-review\
    \ type of session. However, you can't claim that it's a peer-reviewed poster.\
    \ You are, in fact, getting your work reviewed by your peers, meaning that others\
    \ in the field will look at what you've done and have the opportunity to point\
    \ out mistakes. This peer feedback is a cornerstone of scientific practice. \n\
    \nI'm speaking from a somewhat jaded perspective, so I will describe this process\
    \ in idealized terms. When you are translating your research into a poster, your\
    \ job is to distill the information. You are the person who understands the project\
    \ better than anyone else. If it\u2019s your research project, you likely comprehend\
    \ the intricate details better than anyone else in the world. The individuals\
    \ you communicate with will only have a few minutes, maybe 5 to 10 minutes at\
    \ most, to engage with your work. If you look at events like the Society for Neuroscience\
    \ meeting, there are thousands of posters. As an attendee, you can't possibly\
    \ see them all. You will approach a specific area and engage with a select number\
    \ of posters, spending only a short amount of time on each. So, you'll come up\
    \ to a poster and ask about it, and your job as the presenter is to explain what\
    \ the study was about and what the findings were. Ideally, this can be communicated\
    \ in a way that someone listening could understand the study from start to finish\
    \ in about 3 to 5 minutes. They should leave with a basic understanding of your\
    \ study, such as what was done and what the results were. If you've done well,\
    \ they will be able to summarize your research without needing to know all the\
    \ intricate details. Therefore, there is a specific strategy involved in what\
    \ you include on your poster. The key takeaways that the person walks away with\
    \ should align with the main conclusions you want them to remember."

  text: "In a study, you can present the same information in five different ways,\
    \ allowing the person to walk away with five different beliefs. Hopefully, these\
    \ beliefs will not be incoherent or inconsistent. You can focus on various aspects\
    \ and ensure that you're packaging the information in a way that will make it\
    \ understandable and memorable. Ideally, when they reflect on the study, they\
    \ should say that it was about this person doing this thing and finding this result,\
    \ which should align with your beliefs about the study.\n\nNow, I mentioned what\
    \ would happen if the person stands there politely and doesn't say anything, which\
    \ sometimes occurs. Typically, that's not necessarily an insult; especially at\
    \ conferences, people may be tired and just want to grasp the main points. However,\
    \ in general, in academia and the sciences, if someone starts to criticize your\
    \ work, pulling it apart and picking at the details, it\u2019s actually a compliment.\
    \ They care enough about your work to engage with it and ask questions. This can\
    \ be off-putting, particularly for students who are accustomed to receiving grades,\
    \ but when I ask a lot of questions, it's because I want to know more. I am invested\
    \ in using my time, energy, and focus to do what I was trained to do as a scientist:\
    \ peer review research by looking for problems and mistakes. My goal isn't to\
    \ target those mistakes maliciously but to understand what\u2019s going on and\
    \ ensure that the research is sound, as we aim to create new knowledge.\n\nThis\
    \ brings me to the second part of the strategy. When you're presenting a poster,\
    \ please do not just read the content to the person; that's not engaging for anyone.\
    \ Instead, present it at a high level so that when the person asks questions,\
    \ you have the answers ready. Even if you zip through your presentation and move\
    \ past certain elements, there's a learning curve. The first time you present\
    \ something, you might be surprised by the questions you receive; however, after\
    \ a few conversations, you'll find that 90% of the questions tend to be predictable.\
    \ Therefore, you should be prepared to answer those questions based on the data\
    \ on your paper. For instance, I wouldn\u2019t want to spend time talking about\
    \ the specifics, like how deep the water was in the maze or the exact dimensions\
    \ of the apparatus, but if someone asks how deep it was, I should be ready to\
    \ provide that answer without them even needing to ask."

    \ doing this thing in this maze,\" but the details are there so the person can\
    \ just kind of skim them and understand the answer. I will say that there should\
    \ be some kind of methods section, which should include a visual representation\

    \ by looking at this, that you examined mice in a water bucket with a camera.\

    \ sham, meaning they didn't do anything; one was injured; and one was whatever\
    \ this condition is. Now I have a sense of what it is that you actually did. \n\
    \nIt's really easy, when you know something too well, to skip the parts. I call\
    \ it skipping Step Zero. The immediate questions that anyone coming in would ask\
    \ are often the first things you forget to explain when you get into the details.\
    \ For example, you can show the results, but I could be halfway into my conversation,\
    \ and then the person asks, \"Wait, are these mice, are they rats, are they fruit\
    \ flies, are they on a treadmill, are these C. elegans?\" They start asking questions\
    \ that show it\u2019s clear they don\u2019t even know basic aspects of what I\
    \ did, which was standing in a room with mice in a water bath. \n\nTherefore,\
    \ the methods section should always include something that clearly explains what\
    \ that is. In my preference, this is typically figure one in whatever paper you're\
    \ looking at. This isn't always the case, but I think this is true for papers\
    \ as well. Figure one or something very close to figure one should be some kind\
    \ of picture that clarifies what you're actually doing, and the results should\
    \ have some representation of the data that was recorded. Generally, you want\
    \ there to be some nice harmony here. \n\nThis is also typically where it's your\
    \ job to choose the most important data. For many papers\u2014and certainly for\
    \ numerous studies\u2014you produce a lot of data and various visualizations showing\
    \ different aspects related to the data you recorded. Whatever paper you choose\
    \ could have five, six, ten, or more figures of data in it, but your job is to\
    \ understand what the main figure is, what the main result is. If I can only show\

    \ I can't see where these citations actually happen in the poster. I guess this\

    \ it somewhere, either in the introduction or in the conclusions, stating something\

    of that, I need to cite it. If you are trying to determine whether you should
    trust the resource that I am presenting, I must inform you that the information
    I am providing relies on work that has come before me, and this is that work.
    Hypothetically, if you truly do not trust someone when they present their data
    to you, you can go back and review all the sources they depend on. This is where
    the concept of citation networks comes into play. Any study that has a certain
    number of citations allows you to navigate through other studies, facilitating
    exploration of all the empirical work that has been conducted since, at least,
    the 1800s when tracking this kind of information began.


    For the strict assignment, it is just one requirement. In general, when it comes
    to posters, the citation process is less formal. Posters are usually treated as
    a more informal type of presentation. Not always, but some conferences take them
    quite seriously. However, for those that do, the posters are typically paired
    with a paper. For instance, you write a six-page paper to accompany a poster,
    and the poster itself is generally printed just for the conference as a tool for
    discussion. They usually do not enter the official records of a scientific society
    or similar formal archives. Hence, they are often treated as much more informal.


    The actual, proper review process takes place at the level of articles and papers.
    Does that make sense? Are there any other questions, thoughts, or feelings? Cool.
    I will ensure to plan some time in this two-week period, likely at the beginning
    of this week. I will schedule something in this timeframe to practice your poster.
    I will try to do it the week before it is due because often, after creating the
    poster, you start explaining it and realize that it does not reflect what you
    intended at all. We can conduct some kind of practice session.'

    amount of time that was spent working on that area. However, that's almost never
    what you should do. It's possible that whoever these people are spent a good four
    to five months trying to figure out how to stop the water from leaking out of
    the stupid thing. They kept using something that wasn't working until they finally
    figured out the glue, and then after that, the data just kind of fell out of it.
    When they give the presentation, they're going to spend the first half of the
    conversation talking about all the glue they had to use and how they managed to
    get the water up to the right level. That part shouldn't even be a part of the
    conversation. Sometimes when I'm giving a presentation, I simply say, 'This slide
    transition was six months of my life,' and then I just show the result where it
    worked, omitting the fifteen iterations of failed attempts that I had to go through
    before I got the version that worked. If the things you did to make it work are
    interesting, you might want to document them elsewhere, but a poster is almost
    never the right time for that. There may be a case where someone asks, 'How did
    you get your stupid thing to fill up? Ours keeps leaking.' That's when you can
    say, 'Oh yeah, we used this glue and not the other glue.' You can include a very
    long methods section in the paper you publish, where you can explain why you had
    to use this glue and not the other one. The process of distillation is really

    study follows a specific branch of ways to study the idea of central pattern generators
    as they exist in the spines of invertebrates. There is a general question surrounding
    the presence of CPGs in lower animals. We can study them very carefully in those
    animals because they are simpler; we can open them up and observe these processes
    occurring. However, this raises the question of what role these types of neural
    architectures play in more complex animals, like mammals, which have many more
    neurons and exhibit more complex behaviors, yet share a similar evolutionary history.


    This is a video that is quite old, representing a different era regarding animal
    rights. It shows a cat that has been decerebrated. It is difficult to see, but
    this is the cat being supported by these wires. The cat has had its spinal cord
    severed; the brain is here, the cerebellum is here, and then we have the spine
    and the legs. During this era, they would surgically cut the spinal cord to prevent
    any information from reaching or coming from the legs to the brain. The legs remain
    connected to the spinal cord.


    The interesting result here is that if the cat is supported and walking on a treadmill,
    its hind limbs still engage in rhythmic locomotion. They continue walking due
    to the sensory-motor loops functioning from the feet through the spine and back.
    This outcome challenges much of our intuition about how the spine works; we often
    think of it merely as extension cables leading from the brain down to the muscles.'

  text: 'The first author is typically the person in the lab who did most of the work.
    However, this can vary dramatically by paper, by field, and by other factors.
    If you are in graduate school or a postdoc, you will be considering your first
    author publications differently from your non-first author publications. The middle
    authors are typically individuals who contributed in some way but were not the
    primary researchers of the study.


    Once you start publishing papers, people will begin asking you questions about
    how many first author publications you have compared to second author publications.
    Typically, you will have more second author publications than first author publications.
    When you reach the point of running a lab, people will start asking about how
    many last author publications you have, which indicates whether you are effectively
    training others in the work.


    This is very field dependent. For instance, mathematicians publish their papers
    with authors listed alphabetically, which I find quite interesting. What I am
    describing here reflects standard cultural practices in contemporary scientific
    publishing.


    In the citations, you will see numbers corresponding to where the work was completed,
    often indicating that most of the work was done in Switzerland. There may also
    be a notation indicating that certain authors contributed equally to the work,
    though I can assure you that discussions about who gets to be first author often
    take place despite these notations.


    Another important aspect is the corresponding author. This symbol indicates that
    if you have questions about the paper, you should contact this specific author.
    You will find this typically included as well.


    Finally, from a structural perspective, there is always going to be an acknowledgment
    section somewhere in the paper, where authors thank individuals who helped with
    specific aspects of the work. They should also cite their funding sources, indicating
    where the money came from. In this case, they list several grants from European
    research councils. This illustrates the often expensive funding processes, and
    there will generally be acknowledgments such as thanking the NIH for providing
    grants or other financial support.'

    this grant," and you mention the grant number. For public grants, which most of
    these are, you can look up the grant that was written to fund this research and
    see what they were discussing. This is just another way that people stay connected
    to the larger community when publishing particular papers. Modern papers also
    tend to include sections that list out what each author contributed. For example,
    one author might have helped collect the data while another wrote the manuscript.
    There will usually be a paragraph or two detailing what each author did to earn
    their spot on the author list.


    Now, regarding this particular study, this is your Figure One. This style of figure
    is very common in journals like Science and Nature because those journals are
    very short and dense. Specifically, this is a report, which generally means the
    journal has articles that are full-length and reports that are of shorter length,
    as well as brief communications that fall somewhere in between. This particular
    report is not the longest format; it''s in a shorter form. The entire study is
    five pages long, including the front page, so there are only four pages of written
    text. When you look at the supplemental documents, they will typically resemble
    a Microsoft Word document that has been converted to PDF and can comprise dozens
    of pages.


    This study features a figure that is very dense, with numerous sub-panels and
    includes a professional-looking animation or visualization, which is very indicative
    of this type of journal. In contrast, if you go to more standard journals, like
    the Journal of Biomechanics or any other specific journal, the figures will generally
    appear as if a regular person made them rather than a professional graphics design

    \ summaries within it.\n\nSo we\u2019re going to look at this; this is figure\
    \ one, which will be referenced in the article somewhere. Figure S1 is a supplemental\
    \ figure. They are even citing figures that are not in the main article; you have\
    \ to go to the supplemental information to get the results. But this is the first\
    \ one I\u2019m seeing. Figure 1C represents this figure, and the letters correspond\
    \ to sections. The figure will always have a caption, which includes a one-sentence\
    \ summary of what we\u2019re looking at, and then each lettered subsection has\
    \ a little write-up of what\u2019s going on in that section.\n\nGenerally, figure\
    \ one should always be a methods figure, and it should ideally have representative\
    \ data. This one is doing both; it serves as both a methods figure and a representation\
    \ of representative data. Now, looking at what they were actually doing here:\
    \ they are examining central pattern generators in mammals, specifically in rats,\
    \ as they use rats for this study."

  text: "Their model organism is not focused on rats; they are using rats as a proxy\
    \ animal. They believe that rats have sufficient complexity that, if we learn\
    \ something about how something works in a rat, it will be helpful in developing\
    \ a treatment for humans. I happen to know that, if you look at what this researcher\
    \ has been up to recently, they have been able to apply these findings in humans.\
    \ I think they are actually getting to the point where they are restoring voluntary\
    \ control of locomotion after a paralyzed spinal cord injury. I haven't checked\
    \ in on them in a couple of years, I guess, but this researcher is one of those\
    \ leading figures in the field. If you go to the Society for Neuroscience (SFN)\
    \ meeting, he has several rows of people working in his lab. It\u2019s like a\
    \ business owner type of scenario, which creates a very different vibe than a\
    \ lab like mine that has just three people in it. I wouldn't want to run a lab\
    \ like that; it sounds overwhelming.\n\nSo, the idea was, they took the rats and\
    \ gave them a surgical spinal cord injury. They performed the surgery and created\
    \ an injury that damaged their spine and severed all the fibers going to their\
    \ brain. This is a picture of the central nervous system of a rat. These are the\
    \ two lobes of the brain, and the spinal cord itself is represented here. The\
    \ clever part of their approach is that instead of making a single cut across\
    \ the spine, they made two cuts: one at about 60% of the way through the spine\
    \ and then a little bit below, creating another cut. This way, all of the fibers\
    \ that go through this section are severed, but they are not completely removing\
    \ tissue. There is still hypothetically a path for the fibers to regrow and reconnect.\
    \ If it were possible for these fibers to kind of regrow and reform, then you\
    \ could theoretically have recovery potential."

    \ to the brain. The idea was that this process is similar to what was shown in\
    \ the cat video. They performed surgery on these rats, using a scalpel to make\
    \ cuts in certain areas. In the study, an adult rat received a left lateral hemisection\
    \ at thoracic vertebrae T7 and a right lateral hemisection at T10. If you understand\
    \ the terminology, you can see that \u2018hemisection\u2019 means slightly more\
    \ than half, indicating they went beyond the halfway point. \n\nThey then placed\
    \ the rat in this little robotic gait entry system. This system resembles the\
    \ 2012 version of the wire support and treadmill setup used in the cat study.\
    \ Essentially, they were able to create a mechanism similar to a 3D printer, where\
    \ the motor control moves over a two-dimensional plane and then lowers to provide\
    \ support. It supports the rat's partial body weight, ensuring it is not completely\
    \ off the ground, nor does it bear its full body weight. This setup allows the\
    \ rat to turn while maintaining body weight support. It consistently detects what\
    \ is happening and ensures the rat has 10 to 20 percent of its body weight on\
    \ the ground. As a result, we are not surprised to learn that even after these\
    \ modifications..."

  text: "The activity is held upright so it walks in a bipedal way, which would be\
    \ cute if it weren't so mob-like. This is what intact means: not chopped up. The\
    \ intact animal's behavior looks like this. The trajectories in blue here represent\
    \ the trajectories of the feet. We are not shocked to learn that even after an\
    \ injury, they can still walk decently, okay? If you put them in a little robotic\
    \ device and drag them along, they can walk just fine. There's a complicated electrochemical\
    \ process that they incorporate into their spine to ensure that the neurons remain\
    \ active and healthy, firing hard enough to move the limbs. What they found with\
    \ those cats is that, even though the video you saw was probably right after the\
    \ surgery was done, typically, the behaviors extinguish over time. After a couple\
    \ of hours or days, and I think no more than weeks, the cat would stop demonstrating\
    \ that behavior, and if you put it back on the treadmill, it would just kind of\
    \ wind up dragging its feet. One of the results they built on from their own lab\
    \ involved creating a combination of a pharmaceutical cocktail and a specific\
    \ electrical stimulation pattern. This allows them to keep the deactivated animals\
    \ performing this movement for a sort of arbitrary amount of time. So, that's\
    \ the main setup. We have these deactivated animals that can perform this walking\
    \ task, which is good for them. However, while all of this is cool, none of it\
    \ is shocking; this is all stuff we already knew when we showed the cat video.\
    \ The specific goal they are trying to achieve is to restore the animals' ability\
    \ to initiate walking. Much of the previous work involved dragging them along\
    \ on a treadmill so they receive the necessary stimulus\u2014the dragging of the\
    \ feet leads to sensory signals that prompt them to take steps. However, the rat\
    \ cannot just sit there and decide to start walking forward. They are trying to\
    \ restore that ability. There's a lot going on in terms of methodology, which\
    \ has too much depth for me to go into, but I will say they then divided the animals\
    \ into two groups."

  text: "One of the groups of animals was in the control condition, which involved\
    \ training. They would perform surgery on them and provide them with an electrochemical\
    \ prosthetic that allows them to continue walking. Then, they would put them in\
    \ a robotic suit and have them complete movement training, taking a series of\
    \ steps in a row. The other group, which is where the main interesting point of\
    \ the paper comes in, also underwent a matched amount of training, taking the\
    \ same number of steps. However, before they began the robotic assistance, the\
    \ researchers would place chocolate in front of their faces, as rats apparently\
    \ enjoy chocolate. Seeing the chocolate, the rats would express their desire to\
    \ it, and then the robot would pull them forward, prompting them to perform the\
    \ stepping behavior. After completing the task, they were rewarded by being allowed\
    \ to eat the chocolate that had been presented. Thus, we have two matched groups\
    \ of rats: one was trained and performed steps using the robotic gantry system,\
    \ while the other completed the same steps but received a motivating food reward\
    \ for their actions. In the last two minutes of class, if we examine the results\
    \ closely, we find that the animals who only engaged in the basic training did\
    \ not improve; eventually, their behavior became extinguished, and they never\
    \ regained their capabilities. In contrast, the animals that were rewarded with\
    \ chocolate experienced a kind of regrowth pattern. Over time, they began to form\
    \ connections that bypassed the injury site. Eventually, they would see the chocolate\
    \ and could initiate the stepping behavior on their own, before the robotic gantry\
    \ pulled them forward. I think that is truly amazing. This process taps into how\
    \ we move our bodies in the world. It wasn't enough for the control rats to continue\
    \ stepping, as it lacked connection to their environment. Conversely, those in\
    \ the chocolate condition had the experience of seeing something desirable in\
    \ the world\u2014something in front of them that they wanted. They needed to walk\
    \ to reach it. As they began walking, unaware they were being assisted by a robot,\
    \ they eventually got to eat the chocolate. This scenario triggers the concept\
    \ of the dopaminergic reward system, where the brain is flooded with reward chemicals,\
    \ primarily dopamine, alongside other substances that contribute to this process."

  text: It has the effect of reinforcing all the neurons that were just firing. The
    dopaminergic reward system is kind of how that works. So, it's that connection
    between that frontal area, that volitional sort of prefrontal cortex aspect, where
    you think, "I wish I was over there so I could eat the chocolate." Then a bunch
    of neural activity happens, you get to eat the chocolate, and your brain gets
    flooded with neurons that say, "Whatever was just happening, reinforce that."
    This is enough to trigger the regrowth of neurons at the spinal level. That is
    as much as I'm going to say about this paper. End of class, so thanks for following
    along, and I'll see you all on Wednesday. We're going to discuss two papers. Someday
    I'll learn; I'll never learn.
