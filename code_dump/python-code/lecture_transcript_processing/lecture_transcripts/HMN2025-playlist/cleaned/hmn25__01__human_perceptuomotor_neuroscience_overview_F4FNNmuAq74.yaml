full_transcript: "We're recording now. To repeat that, the proper assignment, specifically\
  \ the poster proposal assignment, will be a one or two sentence write-up on the\
  \ topic area that you want your poster to focus on, along with a singular citation\
  \ of a paper that represents the research in that area. \n\nThe standard assignment\
  \ for 22.99 is for you to pick a singular paper for the whole semester, and your\
  \ poster will be you presenting just that paper. I think we can go a little beyond\
  \ that if you want to, but I also think it\u2019s valid to focus on just one paper.\
  \ However, I would like to keep us honest, so I\u2019m going to ask you to pick\
  \ a singular paper. The bot-mediated conversation will be designed to help you with\
  \ that. You can give it your topic, a paper you're considering, and its abstract.\
  \ I will program the bot to ask you questions similar to what I would if I had the\
  \ time and energy to discuss it one-on-one. \n\nBehind the scenes, when discussing\
  \ this class, we are generally advised to help you avoid choosing a review article\
  \ for your paper and instead focus on a proper empirical research article. When\
  \ you search for papers on a given topic, review articles often appear at the top\
  \ of the list, and it\u2019s not always obvious whether you\u2019re looking at a\
  \ review, a book chapter, or an empirical study. I can direct the bot to assist\
  \ you with that by asking about methodologies and topics, helping you parse the\
  \ dense language typically found in abstracts or scientific papers. \n\nThere will\
  \ also be a simple checkbox-style assignment on Canvas and a Discord server-based\
  \ conversation space. These will be due next week, meaning 11:59 PM on Sunday before\
  \ the following Monday. If you don\u2019t meet that deadline, there will be dire\
  \ consequences. Not really, but we want to maintain a general cadence so that we\u2019\
  re all on the same path. By the end of next week, I will have... I implemented features\
  \ where the bot keeps track of a profile of your interests and tries to assist you\
  \ in the journey you will take through this general field. But we\u2019ll see; anytime\
  \ I make a promise about the future, just know that internally, I am screaming.\
  \ Great. Okay, who cares? Yes, let's go ahead and get into it. I know what to do\
  \ regarding methods, but I realized I forgot something: motion capture tracking,\
  \ etc. I also forgot a piece of equipment that I intended to bring today, so I will\
  \ use this instead. It seems someone doesn't know how to use great equipment. That\
  \ works!\n\nAlrighty, so let us begin the lecture properly. It's been nice for the\
  \ first part of this class to see you guys talking about your interests in the server,\
  \ interacting with the bot about what you're into, and what you want to study. I\
  \ intentionally wanted that part to happen first before I talked too much about\
  \ my own particular map of this space. I didn\u2019t want to influence you; I wanted\
  \ you to think about it for yourselves before I came up and did the traditional\
  \ professor thing, which is to tell you, \"Here\u2019s what this field is, here\u2019\
  s what this means, here\u2019s what is on-topic, and here\u2019s what is off-topic.\"\
  \ I generally don't think that's how we should approach intellectual inquiry. In\
  \ the next chunk of time, I will give you an overview of this domain of human knowledge.\
  \ Centered neuroscience is mostly related to my own particular history, my own research\
  \ background, and the studies that I've done. By the time you have lived long enough\
  \ to develop specialties and personal experiences, you will have charted your own\
  \ path and trajectory into the heart of some field or domain. For pretty much all\
  \ of you, everyone who chooses to follow a route like that, you will have a unique\
  \ path. Each person's path will be different, and the topics that are relevant to\
  \ everyone\u2019s interests will also be different. \n\nI don't want to present\
  \ this material as if I am saying, \"Here is everything that matters; here is everything\
  \ that is relevant to this topic.\" I really want to keep it on a relatively personalized\
  \ narrative, focusing on the topics that are most important for me to study human\
  \ perceptual-motor neuroscience in the specific ways I have learned. I will discuss\
  \ this in the context of the component pieces of my particular specialty. \n\nThe\
  \ beauty of using AI-mediated tools in a classroom setting is that, in a traditional\
  \ class, the professor lays out the curriculum, the structure, and the topic area,\
  \ and then everyone is constrained to follow that structure. This is largely for\
  \ practical reasons; it is too difficult and requires too much human labor to mediate\
  \ and navigate the varying interests of people in a room, even one labeled under\
  \ a specific course title. \n\nHowever, I believe with AI, limited though it may\
  \ be, it will always do its best to make your interests relevant to the topics that\
  \ I have mandated it should care about. So as I start going through this material,\
  \ I encourage you to really tune into your own personal feelings of interest, to\
  \ notice what draws you in or moves you about a particular topic or domain. If you\
  \ want to follow the trajectories that I'm presenting, that's all well and good.\
  \ However, even if you wanted to, it wouldn't happen that way because that's not\
  \ how the world works. As I give this lecture, keep that in mind. My main request\
  \ for you is to just not let your brain turn all the way off. I'm going to be talking\
  \ fast about a lot of topics that may be relatively unfamiliar. For some of them,\
  \ it might be the first time you've heard about it, and for others, you might have\
  \ heard about it before. The goal is not to have you understand everything that\
  \ I'm saying; rather, the goal is to expose you to it. \n\nAs I start talking, don't\
  \ get too hung up on whether or not you're following everything. Just try to remember\
  \ the words as much as you can and let it wash over you. I promise you that some\
  \ of it will stick. When we open things back up, you can start asking questions\
  \ about the parts that you found most interesting. \n\nWhat I have found most gratifying\
  \ about doing this type of class is the discovery. Every time I give a lecture on\
  \ a given topic and then tell 40 students to ask questions about the parts they\
  \ found most interesting, I typically see 40 different conversations about 40 different\
  \ topics. That's really a lot of fun. \n\nWith that said, let us get into it. Unfortunately,\
  \ I intended to bring a tablet so I could draw things with colors, and I brought\
  \ the tablet, but when I looked for the pen, I found that I had thrown a standard\
  \ pencil in here instead. I can't even imagine what was going on when I did that,\
  \ so we'll be doing it the old school way with just one color. But that's okay.\
  \ \n\nSo, the topic of the course is neuroscience. The department is biology, and\
  \ most of you, as biology majors, have internalized to some degree that biology\
  \ and neuroscience are related to things like cells, neurons, and wet lab microscopes.\
  \ Types of conversations and topics are super valid and important to explore. They\
  \ are all part and parcel of a particular philosophical tradition that is fundamental\
  \ to the way we conduct scientific research in 2025 on Earth. This tradition is\
  \ so ingrained that we often don't even think about it, and that is the concept\
  \ of reductionism. Reductionism is a general philosophical approach to the study\
  \ of the natural world that tries to break things down into smaller and smaller\
  \ pieces. This allows for more precise measurements and more detailed investigations.\
  \ The implicit assumption is that by analyzing the component parts of the world,\
  \ we will gain a better understanding of how everything works. There is a lot of\
  \ validity to that approach, but there are also significant limitations. If you're\
  \ only examining the smaller pieces in isolation, you will struggle to see what\
  \ we call emergent properties. These properties only emerge when we observe the\
  \ combination of parts at a larger scale than what can be contained in a test tube\
  \ or viewed under a microscope. A classic example of emergence is traffic. Traffic\
  \ is a property of cars on a road, but you can never understand traffic by looking\
  \ at just one car. It is only when you observe the cars operating together in their\
  \ natural environment that you begin to grasp the concept of traffic. The counter\
  \ to reductionism might be termed holism, which is the scale where my research domain\
  \ tends to operate. I do not focus on studies involving highly reduced approaches,\
  \ such as electrophysiology, where electrodes are inserted into the brains of various\
  \ animals, or fMRI studies where participants are placed in a tube to measure the\
  \ magnetic resonance of their hemoglobin in their brains. Instead, my research focuses\
  \ on humans behaving in natural environments and performing the kinds of activities\
  \ we do in our day-to-day lives. For example, throwing objects into the air and\
  \ catching them involves motor behavior, applying force to the object, an information-gathering\
  \ phase, and then executing another motor command. If this command aligns with the\
  \ world, the action succeeds; if not, the object falls. My research is centered\
  \ on understanding these complex interactions and behaviors. That behavioral process\
  \ in its natural context involves using the best measurements I can devise for those\
  \ behaviors. I try to connect these measurements to the more low-level, reductionist\
  \ fields of inquiry so that we can understand how elements like cells and neurons\
  \ can lead to complex behaviors. I think of it as a robotics approach. I like to\
  \ tell people that I study the part of neuroscience that overlaps with robotics;\
  \ robotics is a field that keeps you honest in the sense that you create things\
  \ that move around in the real world. You can't cut corners because if you do, the\
  \ robot just stops working. The difference is that we know how robots work because\
  \ we made them, while humans can do things we don't fully understand. This combination\u2014\
  thinking of humans as magical meat robots\u2014allows us to study and comprehend\
  \ them from this perspective, which can yield useful insights. The nice thing about\
  \ this approach is the abstraction away from the biology, even though we know it\
  \ involves cells, neurons, membrane potentials, and so forth. We think more in terms\
  \ of the measurable aspects, which we will discuss shortly.\n\nSo, speaking of the\
  \ natural world, let's talk about something that helps parse out that general topic,\
  \ which is called the perception-action cycle. Let's start by drawing a brain. I'm\
  \ trying to draw it... yes, let's do it like this. Here's how you draw a brain.\
  \ There you go. This is a picture of your brain. That's your temporal lobe, and\
  \ this is your eye, facing that way. There are many details not covered here, but\
  \ this is the general shape. So here you are\u2014that's you, and your existence.\
  \ In the world, let's do this in a different way. There you go. That's you. You're\
  \ in the world. Here\u2019s your body; here\u2019s your eye; here\u2019s your mouth.\
  \ And then inside of there, that\u2019s your brain, not to scale. As you are in\
  \ the world, you have a very limited awareness of your given context, and everything\
  \ that you know comes in through your senses and your memory.\n\nSo, let\u2019s\
  \ think about a particular moment in time where you\u2019re sitting here. You have\
  \ your eye, and then you see out here, there\u2019s a cat. You like cats. So, light\
  \ from the sun bounces off the cat and goes into your eye. We will talk a lot about\
  \ eyes; we\u2019ll discuss the lens, the retina, the fovea, and the optic nerve.\
  \ The main thing to understand is that your eye is the place where environmental\
  \ energy is first absorbed by your nervous system. This moment right here is a very\
  \ special moment in your perceptual cycle, which is the moment of transduction.\
  \ This term refers to the moment when some form of environmental energy, in this\
  \ case, light, gets transduced and converted into neural activity in your eye. The\
  \ light goes in, into your retina, into your fovea, which we will talk about plenty.\n\
  \nThere\u2019s a particular class of molecules called opsin. Opsins look roughly\
  \ like this: they are made of carbon and hydrogen, forming a hexagon with a long,\
  \ wiggly tail. People in biochemistry are probably familiar with these shapes, except\
  \ this is not drawn well. You have a bunch of these opsins in your eye, and there\
  \ are basically three main ones. They are tuned \u2014 if you want to use that term\
  \ \u2014 to different wavelengths of light. Wavelengths of light and their nature\
  \ indicate that when a photon of light hits them, they absorb the energy of that\
  \ photon and then change shape. I think I actually did this backward; I think they\
  \ start out with a kink, and then when they absorb the light, they straighten out.\
  \ However, regardless of the specifics, this absorption of a photon changes the\
  \ electrochemical properties of the molecule, causing it to transition from being\
  \ neutral to plus one, minus one, or whatever it is. The point is that the light\
  \ coming from the environment, bouncing off the cat, entering your eye, changes\
  \ the chemical layout of the opsin. This occurs in trillions and billions of instances,\
  \ as biology tends to operate on this scale. This change alters the polarity and\
  \ electrical state of the rods and cones in your retina, which then get accumulated\
  \ with ganglia and various other components. This leads to a shift in the electrical\
  \ potential in that section of your retina, which is then sent as spikes down your\
  \ optic nerves. Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of neuroscience, and\
  \ mostly what neurons do is spike; they send little electrical pulses to communicate\
  \ whatever stimuli they have detected. In the context of perception and vision,\
  \ the absorption of light into the opsin and the consequent shift in polarity and\
  \ electrical state ultimately results in changes in the spike rate of a given ganglion\
  \ cell as it sends its axon down the optic nerve to your occipital lobe and the\
  \ visual cortex. We will discuss this in more detail and coherence later, but the\
  \ key takeaway here is that the light absorbed by your eye is subsequently converted\
  \ through this complex biochemical mechanism into a pattern of neural activity.\
  \ Since the neural activity is triggered by the light, and because the light has\
  \ been reflected off the object in question, there is a prevailing belief and assumption\
  \ that the pattern of neural activity corresponds in some way to the object in the\
  \ real world. There is some statistical correlation or relationship present in the\
  \ pattern of neural activity. Somehow, the brain encodes information about the world\
  \ you're looking at. The nature of that relationship is tenuous and complex, and,\
  \ generally speaking, extremely impoverished. The actual information we're getting\
  \ in any moment in time is far less than you think it would be. It's a lot, but\
  \ the richness of your visual environment, for example, is very much an illusion\
  \ based on your brain's ability to sort of cobble together a lot of noisy information\
  \ to give you something that's accurate enough to move through the world, but often\
  \ in a way that's almost exclusively designed after the fact.\n\nSo, that's your\
  \ brain again. It's more like a mashup but that's fine. The light comes into your\
  \ eye, gets absorbed by the retina, which is on the back of your eye. It sends a\
  \ pattern of neural activity down your optic nerve, passing through some subcortical\
  \ areas, the thalamus, and so on, which we won't talk about too much. There is some\
  \ processing that happens in that area.\n\nThen, the information projects down to\
  \ the occipital lobe, otherwise known as the visual cortex, which is located at\
  \ the back of your brain. It's not super important to know where it is, but it's\
  \ just one of those things where vision happens at the back of the brain for whatever\
  \ reason. This is the place where the first pass of information about your visual\
  \ environment starts to get computed. This information is mostly in the form of\
  \ edges, dark patches, light patches, and similar attributes.\n\nOnce you get from\
  \ V1, which is the primary visual cortex, the information goes through other stages\
  \ of processing, leading to progressively more complex structures emerging. For\
  \ example, you start with things like edges, and if you have enough edges, you can\
  \ discern patches. With patches, you can perceive textures, and with textures, you\
  \ can recognize objects. Each stage of visual processing builds on the previous\
  \ stage, eventually leading to the ability to do things like object recognition,\
  \ such as identifying that something out there is a cat.\n\nThere\u2019s a discussion\
  \ to be had about the parts of that process that occur in the temporal lobe, which\
  \ is here. This tends to be the area responsible for identifying objects, like saying,\
  \ \"That's a desk,\" or, \"That's a computer.\" The part that we tend to care more\
  \ about in this class is the part that goes in this direction, which tends to be\
  \ more in tune with using that information to plan your movement out in the world.\
  \ Something that I haven't said yet, but which is important to repeat, is that this\
  \ is a cartoon; this is a very abstracted, simplified version of a story. If you\
  \ wanted to tell the whole story, you would have to recount a thousand stories of\
  \ a thousand humans in their labs recording data, gathering numbers, and making\
  \ up their own stories in the discussion sections of their papers about what the\
  \ different parts mean. This cartoonified story is the version that tends to make\
  \ it into the textbooks that we communicate back to you in an attempt to make sense\
  \ of any of it. However, it is really important that we remember this is not the\
  \ real story; this is the cartoon, and the real story is something to which we do\
  \ not actually have access. There is no level of class where I can simply give you\
  \ the book that says, \"Here is what the visual cortex is actually doing.\" The\
  \ best I could do is provide you with a record of all the empirical measurements\
  \ that all the researchers who have investigated this topic have put together. Then,\
  \ I can tell you the story that we have collectively decided is the best account\
  \ of how we think this part of this lumpy pink matter inside of our skulls operates.\
  \ But there is an essential gap between epistemology, which is our knowledge of\
  \ things, and metaphysics, which involves what actually exists. The two concepts\
  \ never truly touch; there will always be a difference between knowing something\
  \ and what that thing actually is. Throughout the history of science, we have told\
  \ many stories about what we think is going on in the world, in our bodies, and\
  \ in our biological processes. Historically, every single one of those stories has\
  \ been proven wrong, in some sense, over a long enough time scale. Everything we\
  \ currently think will eventually be shown to be inaccurate in some way or another.\
  \ We have evidence for that, given that everything we've ever believed up until\
  \ this point has been proven wrong in some way. So, if you think there's something\
  \ special about today that will prevent this from continuing indefinitely until\
  \ the sun burns out, consider this: the beauty of the scientific process lies in\
  \ our belief that, despite everything being incorrect, each successive idea is less\
  \ wrong than the one before it. \"Wrong\" means that it allows us to make more precise\
  \ predictions. It allows us to heal sickness better. It allows us to build machines\
  \ that do more exciting things. Sometimes those improvements happen by completely\
  \ throwing out philosophical base-level beliefs about how certain things work. But\
  \ yes, it's a continuous process. We'll talk about it. \n\nSo, here we are in this\
  \ cycle: the light has bounced off the cat, hit your eye, been absorbed, and transmitted\
  \ back to your visual cortex. You have identified that it's a cat, and you have\
  \ an inbuilt volition that says, \"I like to touch cats.\" Great, we support this\
  \ for you. \n\nThis is the parietal lobe. Don't worry about the parietal lobe; it's\
  \ great, but you can worry about it if you want. The important part\u2014this back\
  \ here is your visual cortex. This on the side here, roughly speaking, is your motor\
  \ cortex. Eventually, as you look at more and more pictures of the brain, you will\
  \ see that the wrinkles and structures on the brain are not random. They are conserved\
  \ in the same sense that while every face looks very different, they generally have\
  \ two eyes, a nose, and a mouth in different configurations. \n\nThe wrinkly structures\
  \ and the crevices and bumps in our brain are roughly the same. If you were to crack\
  \ open all the brains in this room, which I don't recommend, you would find a lot\
  \ of correspondence in where the big creases occur. I am not at the level of that\
  \ anatomy where I can name them off the top of my head, but I do recognize them\
  \ in pictures. It's easy to tell when someone is drawing a brain artistically versus\
  \ when they are looking at anatomy because artists often depict it simply as a bunch\
  \ of pink wrinkles, which is not actually how we do it. \n\nAnyways, there's a big\
  \ one right in the middle called the central sulcus. A sulcus is like the crease\
  \ part. On this side of that sulcus is the somatosensory cortex. Somatosensation\
  \ is basically touch\u2014think of that type of sensation. On the other side is\
  \ the motor cortex, the sensory cortex, and then the motor cortex.\" They tend to\
  \ be paired, and you can look up the Huny Li when we talk about the motor cortex.\
  \ I enjoy this distinction. There are two sides of the brain: on one side, you have\
  \ sensation and the perception of the world, like visual aspects and sensory aspects;\
  \ and then on the other side of the brain, we start getting into motor actions and\
  \ movements, the outgoing parts of things. As we keep going forward, you eventually\
  \ get to the frontal lobes. The frontal lobe is the big lumpy part in the front;\
  \ it\u2019s considered the most human part of the brain. All mammal brains are roughly\
  \ the same anatomically; they're just mirrored into different shapes and sizes.\
  \ For example, rats have a much more pronounced olfactory bulb for smell versus\
  \ their visual cortex. The human brain has a lot of extra anatomy in that frontal\
  \ lobe area. This is thought to be where decision making comes from, where language\
  \ kind of lives, and is often referenced in discussions about executive function,\
  \ the feeling of deciding what you want to do. This is also where metacognition\
  \ happens, so if you're having thoughts about your thoughts, like \u201COh yeah,\
  \ I\u2019m angry right now,\u201D that\u2019s a frontal lobe area. I'm reiterating\
  \ the point that every time I point to a part of the brain and say, \u201CThis is\
  \ the part that does this thing,\u201D a part of me is screaming inside because\
  \ none of this is how any of it really works. That\u2019s the cartoon; the real\
  \ world is much more complex and noisier than that. But if I say, \u201CThis is\
  \ where executive function happens,\u201D and point at the front of the brain, and\
  \ then say, \u201CThis is where vision happens,\u201D and point at the back of the\
  \ brain, that statement is more true than if I switch those two things around. It\u2019\
  s important to reiterate that, even though I am telling you these simplified stories\u2014\
  these textbook-level conversations about how the brain works\u2014if we come back\
  \ to this class in 250 years, we're going to be saying very different things, but\
  \ we\u2019ll probably still agree that vision happens in the back and cognition\
  \ happens in the front. Anyway, from this frontal lobe, you get the frontal area\
  \ for executive functions, then you get your premotor area, and somewhere around\
  \ here is where volition arises. Volition is in the same realm as voluntary actions;\
  \ it\u2019s about the things you want to do. For instance, you see the cat and say,\
  \ \u201CI want to touch the cat.\u201D Is the cat. Look at me; I'm touching it,\
  \ and this is what I want to happen. Now you are in this state where here\u2019\
  s your body, here\u2019s your hand, and here\u2019s this cat. There's this desire\
  \ that I wish my hand was on this cat. Now there's a gap between how the world is,\
  \ according to your perception, and how you wish the world would be, which is that\
  \ your hand is touching this object. Those volitions meld with the perceptual experience,\
  \ and from this alchemy emerges something resembling a motor plan. I\u2019m trying\
  \ to refrain from going into details because we will have a whole lecture about\
  \ the eye and another lecture about the motor cortex to discuss this in more detail.\
  \ For now, I\u2019m just giving an overview. This is where we first start to see\
  \ something resembling a motor plan. Many of you have been discussing concepts like\
  \ muscle memory in the chats. Muscle memory is a term we commonly use; it\u2019\
  s a standard human expression. However, physiologically, muscle memory doesn\u2019\
  t truly exist. Your muscles don\u2019t have memory; they are much simpler objects,\
  \ which we will also discuss. Usually, when you mention muscle memory, you are referring\
  \ to a motor plan. As you work on something more and gain expertise and experience,\
  \ what we tend to call muscle memory is actually the motor plans becoming more robust\
  \ and more locked in. Typically, much of that motor planning takes place not necessarily\
  \ in the motor cortex but in subcortical regions. If you think about a picture of\
  \ the brain, the pink wrinkly structure in your skull is your cortex, specifically\
  \ the neocortex, which is the part where most processing happens. We will talk a\
  \ little about what processing means in this context, but I like to describe it\
  \ as the bloom of the rose on the rose bush when discussing the nervous system.\
  \ When you're looking at a rose bush, it makes a lot of sense that we tend to focus\
  \ on the rose, like the red thing with petals that smells nice. We spend a lot of\
  \ our time focusing on that part of the plant for very good reason. However, if\
  \ you really take a step back and look at it from a botany point of view, it's mostly\
  \ bush and just a little bit of rose. I think that's kind of the same with the way\
  \ our cortex works. The majority of our central nervous system is not in that cortex;\
  \ it's in the subcortical regions. Among my favorite of those subcortical regions\
  \ is the cerebellum, which sort of sits at this fist-shaped area right below your\
  \ cortex. When you look up pictures of the brain online, you'll see the big pink\
  \ wrinkly thing along with this more dense, grayish-looking structure underneath\
  \ it. That's your cerebellum. Your cerebellum is a very complicated beast; it contains\
  \ about 3.5 times as many neurons as the rest of your central nervous system combined.\
  \ That number is strangely conserved across different animals, particularly mammals.\
  \ We all have a cortex and a cerebellum, but we have very different brain-to-body\
  \ ratios and different proportions. However, in general, whatever the size of your\
  \ brain and whatever animal you are, your cerebellum has three and a half times\
  \ as many neurons as the rest of your cortex. I always come back to that; it seems\
  \ interesting that you find this number in nature that's conserved across a bunch\
  \ of different species. I wish I knew more about it. One part of the reason why\
  \ the cerebellum has so many more neurons by count is that the neurons associated\
  \ with it are tiny. You have granule cells and you have Purkinje cells. Let's look\
  \ up pictures because Purkinje cells in your cerebellum are one of the more beautiful\
  \ parts of your brain. You have the cell body, the axon, and then there are thousands\
  \ upon thousands of synapses. This picture is famous; it was actually taken by...\
  \ Pinji, the guy who created\u2014oh, sorry, Kahal\u2014says right there, Ramon\
  \ Kahal, who was part of the group that came up with the staining mechanisms that\
  \ allowed us to start looking at neurons in their isolation. This happened around\
  \ 1909. Before that, we didn't really know what neurons were; we didn't know if\
  \ they were just one big mass or if they were individualized pieces. There was a\
  \ big scientific and philosophical debate about whether the brain is one big connected\
  \ piece or whether the neurons touch or are separated from each other. Ramon Kahal\
  \ argued in favor of the synapse doctrine, which said that there was a gap between\
  \ them. I think it was Golgi who argued in favor of the idea that everything is\
  \ touching. Golgi developed a silver nitrate staining process that allowed them\
  \ to make images like this of looking at cells. Ironically, by creating that staining\
  \ process, he proved Kahal's side of the argument correct\u2014that neurons tend\
  \ not to touch. They both received a Nobel Prize, but apparently, they had such\
  \ bad blood between them that they spent their entire acceptance speeches bashing\
  \ each other.\n\nSo, your cerebellum consists of Purkinje cells and then granule\
  \ cells, which, in comparison, look more like this. They are small and do not have\
  \ these super long fibers that extend very long distances; they are much more localized,\
  \ connecting only to their immediate neighbors. The majority of neurons in your\
  \ nervous system are these granule cells that reside in your cerebellum. Your cerebellum\
  \ is layered, like most parts of your brain, with layers that tend to operate phylogenetically.\
  \ The newest stuff is on the outside, while the older stuff is on the inside. The\
  \ cerebellum has that structure as well. We may talk about it, but I'm not sure\u2014\
  \ we'll see. It's one of those things where if enough people ask about it, I might\
  \ steer the lectures based on the class's interest. But anyway, we're talking about\
  \ cats. So, when light hits the cat, it hits your eye, is absorbed in your retina,\
  \ tweaks your opsins, and triggers a neural... Cascade vibrated your visual cortex\
  \ and gave you the perception of a cat. Your volitional desire to touch the cat,\
  \ combined with the knowledge that there is a cat in front of you, started creating\
  \ a motor plan. This is where the process becomes quite complex, as there is a lot\
  \ of controversy surrounding the different steps involved. Long story short, something\
  \ in the combination of your motor cortex and your cerebellum, which is largely\
  \ concerned with movement, plays a significant role. The cerebellum is thought to\
  \ be related to tool use, which is a capability that humans possess; we can pick\
  \ up an object and quickly learn the physics of it, utilizing it as a tool with\
  \ specific characteristics. This ability is often considered a feature of the neocortex,\
  \ which is the new part of the brain that is complicated and has a hierarchical\
  \ nature to the motor system. At the higher levels, particularly in the frontal\
  \ lobe, the plans become much more abstract. These include thoughts like \"I'm thirsty\"\
  \ or \"I wish I was drinking water right now.\" In order for that high-level volition\
  \ to result in actions that lead to achieving my goal, there must be a narrowing\
  \ down of specificity from that high-level volition to commands that will ultimately\
  \ boil down to muscle firings to move my body through space. So, when I say, \"\
  Oh, I wish I had water,\" I see that there is water over there, and somehow that\
  \ volition is converted into motor commands that move my legs. This positions my\
  \ body so that I can move my arm; I understand how this object works, so I open\
  \ it and I get to drink water. This process typically moves from the motor cortex,\
  \ then to the cerebellum, which has connections to the brain stem. These connections\
  \ can be quite intricate as they are wrapped around each other. The brain stem,\
  \ including the medulla oblongata and pons, is often referred to as the part of\
  \ the brain that regulates the so-called reptilian brain. This area handles essential\
  \ functions such as heart rate, breathing, and regulating body temperature, which\
  \ are managed at the level of the brain stem. The brain stem is also the beginning\
  \ of the spinal cord. Friend, there we go. There you go, perfect. Nice, still. Good\
  \ job. Your spinal cord is a part of your central nervous system. Oftentimes, when\
  \ we think about the spinal cord, it's given a bad reputation. Even when we look\
  \ at pictures of the central nervous system, you'll often see images that stop at\
  \ a certain point, focusing on the brain. The cerebellum often gets included, but\
  \ we typically cut off where the spine is. However, your spine is just as much a\
  \ part of your nervous system as the rest of it. \n\nThe way we're going to define\
  \ the central nervous system, as opposed to the peripheral nervous system, is loosely\
  \ by saying that the central nervous system is where processing happens. Processing\
  \ is a somewhat vague term, but it essentially means that information comes in,\
  \ undergoes some sort of transformation\u2014 which we might call computation if\
  \ we wanted to use a computer analogy\u2014and then information goes out. The spine\
  \ is involved in that kind of processing at various levels, which we will discuss\
  \ further. \n\nIt's fascinating to note that there are stories we will discuss later\
  \ in the semester about studies that we can't perform anymore on cats. In these\
  \ studies, you could sever the spine, cutting it off from the upper part of the\
  \ brain, and the cat could still walk. This is because the spine contains the gray\
  \ matter that handles functions like central pattern generation and reflex responses.\
  \ A central pattern generator is responsible for the basic rhythmic movement of\
  \ the legs, determining when one foot is in stance and the other is in swing, and\
  \ then coordinating the two. Much of that processing happens within the spine itself.\
  \ Your spinal cord actually ends just below your thoracic spine, around this area.\
  \ I know, right? The stuff below that is what's called the cauda equina, which is\
  \ where it does become more extension-like, and you start to lose the gray matter\
  \ and get more peripheral nerves that go out to your limbs. I want to emphasize\
  \ that distinction between the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous\
  \ system. This is often stated as a hard delineation, but there is a lot of gray\
  \ area. One of the most classic gray areas is the retina. The retina has many neurons\
  \ on its back, and there are layers to it. It is often described as the eye, which\
  \ is the classical sensory organ. However, there is a lot happening on the back\
  \ of the retina before anything even leaves via the optic nerve to the brain, which\
  \ could really be considered computation. Similarly, your skin has many connections\
  \ that might also be doing what we might consider computation. For instance, when\
  \ you get hurt and you rub the area, it doesn\u2019t hurt as much. This is because\
  \ the activity of activating sensory organs around the damaged area suppresses the\
  \ pain coming from that area, and that is all happening at the level of your skin.\
  \ Again, these names and terms are not how nature is designed; it's not divided\
  \ into pieces with departments and names. That is something humans created to make\
  \ sense of nature. However, anytime we put a name or a label or category into nature,\
  \ we make concessions and draw lines around areas. This allows us to have better\
  \ conversations about those topics, but there will always be gray areas. Often,\
  \ it is those gray areas or cracks that lead us to abandon certain thoughts and\
  \ move toward others. Speaking of the peripheral nervous system, this is your arm.\
  \ These are your bones, and your bones are mostly what you are, particularly when\
  \ thinking about it in terms of the space that you inhabit. The shape that you are,\
  \ your general ability to move through the world, is mostly determined by bones.\
  \ The additional details, or the \"goop,\" that's associated with that are secondary.\
  \ The overall cookie-cutter shape of you as a creature is driven by these strange\
  \ sticks, and these sticks have odd attachments known as muscles. Eventually, when\
  \ considering the more holistic picture of the world and how you live in it, you\
  \ encounter a reductionist approach. If you're in a lab, living a reductionist life\
  \ and choosing a specific domain of inquiry, you simplify and exclude any extraneous\
  \ factors that may obstruct your focus on that particular topic. This allows you\
  \ to remove all the parts of the question that you don't want to address. For instance,\
  \ as a neuroscientist, you might take a mouse, rat, or fruit fly into the lab and\
  \ eliminate all the elements that aren't relevant to neuroscience, enabling you\
  \ to concentrate on the neurons that matter to you.\n\nHowever, when you're not\
  \ restricted by that capacity and want to think more generally, you lose that luxury.\
  \ If you aim to comprehend how humans move through the world, even if your main\
  \ concern is the neural or perceptual aspects, you are still compelled by the nature\
  \ of reality to consider elements like bones and muscles. This is necessary even\
  \ if those objects aren't primarily neural because the neural activity ultimately\
  \ needs to be transmitted into something that facilitates bodily movement through\
  \ the world. This leads us to the conversation about robotics, where neural activity,\
  \ originally transformed into sensory experiences, like vision, must now be converted\
  \ into environmental energy\u2014specifically mechanical energy. This transformation\
  \ means that when my muscles are activated, my arm moves as a result of this energy\
  \ input. There is literal energy in this movement, specifically in the form of kinetic\
  \ energy; for example, if I'm pulling on a spring, it may involve mechanical energy\
  \ as well. Potential energy, kinetic energy, and spring energy are the things we\
  \ derive from our muscles. The whole perception-action cycle involves the conversion\
  \ of environmental energy into perceptual neural activity, which then translates\
  \ back into a motor action. Muscles are peculiar objects; a muscle is effectively\
  \ a variable stiffness spring. That's essentially what a muscle is. Muscles can\
  \ only pull; they cannot push. When it looks like I'm pushing, it's because this\
  \ muscle is pulling on the tip of that bone, allowing my arm to extend. If I want\
  \ to squeeze, I send a motor command down the nerve to activate the motor unit,\
  \ which tells the surrounding muscle tissue to contract. What was originally a fairly\
  \ wiggly, soft spring gets electrified and transforms into a stiff spring that pulls\
  \ this joint. Muscles operate in pairs: there\u2019s a flexion muscle group and\
  \ an extension muscle group. Those two groups work together to move a degree of\
  \ freedom. The motor plan originates from the motor cortex and passes through the\
  \ cerebellum. For more complex animals, like humans, it goes through the corticospinal\
  \ tract, which connects the motor cortex directly to the spine, bypassing structures\
  \ like the cerebellum. All animals have a corticospinal tract, but it does not exist\
  \ to the same degree across species, which is an interesting distinction in the\
  \ animal kingdom. I often use this question to test AI models to see how they perform\
  \ in neuroscience. I ask about the corticospinal tract and its variations across\
  \ the animal kingdom, as this topic can become quite subtle. I observe how well\
  \ models handle those nuances. While I've discussed how motor cortex commands travel\
  \ through the cerebellum and brainstem, it\u2019s essential to remember the corticospinal\
  \ tract. Whenever you see a lengthy word with an 'o' in the middle, you can replace\
  \ the 'o' with a slash: corticospinal becomes C/cortex S/L. The spinal system goes\
  \ straight from the cortex down to the spine, bypassing all the subcortical regions.\
  \ This allows us to control our individual degrees of freedom of our body directly,\
  \ as opposed to doing things in a more synergistic way, which is much deeper than\
  \ I want to discuss in this particular lecture. \n\nSo here I am; I'm so close,\
  \ almost ready to touch this cat. My motor plan, which comes down from on high through\
  \ the hierarchical structure of our motor system, has taken my awareness of the\
  \ world and my own body. Vision provides me information about remote parts of the\
  \ world\u2014things I cannot touch, things that are outside of my peripersonal space.\
  \ The peripersonal space is the area I can touch with my hands; outside of that\
  \ is a different part of the world that\u2019s happening in the parietal lobe. \n\
  \nOne of my favorite studies involves a monkey that was trained to grab things on\
  \ a desk. They gave it a temporary lesion by squirting something into the part of\
  \ the brain that handles peripersonal perception, which caused that part of the\
  \ brain to go offline. This resulted in what is called cortical blindness, meaning\
  \ the monkey lost its ability to see things in its peripersonal zone. Then, they\
  \ trained the monkey to use a grabber arm\u2014like a little claw arm\u2014so its\
  \ reach extended farther because it could now use this arm. After training, once\
  \ that peripersonal zone was re-established, the blind spot increased to include\
  \ the region that could be reached with the grabber arm, in addition to the hand.\
  \ \n\nConsider that in your worldview and see how it fits. So, here I am; I see\
  \ this cat, and I have this awareness of my body. A lot of this can be associated\
  \ with proprioception. As my arm extends, it exerts force on my joints because of\
  \ its weight. My body can encode this information and is aware of those forces,\
  \ enabling me to know where my arm is. I can also see my arm, and I have a memory\
  \ of lifting it up. There are many ways that we know where our bodies are. I know\
  \ my arm is here, and if I can make this part move that way, then I will have achieved\
  \ my deepest desire of touching this cat. There\u2019s a lot of complicated stuff\
  \ about how we don't move our body one joint at a time; we move it in a sort of\
  \ barely sophisticated dance. A lot of the breakdown and how we choose to break\
  \ down a complex movement across the available joints happens in the context of\
  \ the world, which is a cerebellum thing. But let's pretend like it's not. I relax\
  \ the flexor and tighten the extensor, which puts a torque on this bone and moves\
  \ my hand here. Now I have the reward of cat sensations under my hand, and I have\
  \ achieved this goal of mine. That's the loop; that's one path through the perception-action\
  \ loop. The information has gone in, been processed, and now that I have moved my\
  \ body, I have changed the state of the world\u2014my body is now in the world.\
  \ As I perceive the situation as it stands, I'm perceiving something different,\
  \ and now I'm going to go back through that loop. You perceive, you act, and then\
  \ you take in the information, and that loop tends to be where you live your whole\
  \ life. This is kind of the cartoon overview of the story as it holds. I will name\
  \ some of the fields associated with the things we've talked about. Generally speaking,\
  \ when we talk about the physiology of the eyeball, it tends to be called optology.\
  \ But that's more about the lens, pupil, and the goopy parts. When we discuss the\
  \ neural activity aspect of it, we tend to call that visual neuroscience or perceptual\
  \ neuroscience. Because humans are such vision-heavy animals, when you hear perceptual,\
  \ we often mean visual. But strictly speaking, anything sensory is perceptual. When\
  \ we start talking about the parts of neuroscience that are moving your body, we\
  \ tend to call that motor neuroscience. You will often hear people talk about perceptual\
  \ motor neuroscience, which again, perceptual and motor are connected in a way that\
  \ highlights the reality that these two parts are interlinked. Perception in action\
  \ and perception in motor control are intimately linked. I should mention that in\
  \ your peripheral nervous system, you have peripheral neurons that come in two types:\
  \ perceptual and motor. This distinction is defined by the direction in which information\
  \ is flowing. A motor command goes out from your central nervous system toward your\
  \ periphery, carrying a motor command. This neuron is connected to a motor unit\
  \ in my muscle, and if it gets activated by one of these higher-level structures,\
  \ it will receive spikes telling it to fire, contracting the muscle. Once I touch\
  \ the object, the neurons connected to the sensory organs in my hand start firing\
  \ differently and send information back down the peripheral sensory nerves. So,\
  \ in your periphery, the outward signals are from your motor neurons, while inward\
  \ signals are from your sensory neurons; that's the main distinction. \n\nNow, why\
  \ are we not fully aware? This is one of the most troubling realities of being alive.\
  \ It also contributes to the existential crises that classes like this tend to provoke.\
  \ Have fun with that! We have a very thin awareness of what is happening under the\
  \ hood in our bodies. We possess some awareness and have conscious experiences like,\
  \ \"I'm going to reach out and grab this thing\" or \"This feels cool in my hand\"\
  \ or \"This feels hard in my hand.\" However, the more you learn about neuroscience\
  \ and what's going on beneath the surface, the more you realize that the conscious\
  \ personal experience of having a motor experience is just a thin layer on top of\
  \ the complex processes that are truly happening. Unfortunately, that is the situation.\
  \ that we are in. I remember one time I was in grad school, and we were in a parking\
  \ lot with my friends in winter, waiting to go on a hike or something like that.\
  \ For some reason, this really stuck with me. There was a puddle of dirty water\
  \ in the middle of the parking lot that had this really beautiful oil sheen on top\
  \ of it. It had these fractal iridescent colors. By the nature of oil, it's only\
  \ one molecule thick, which creates this very beautiful, vibrant, colorful shape\
  \ on top of cold, dark, murky water. I think about that a lot when I think about\
  \ the nervous system because it feels like that is kind of our experience of living\
  \ in a body. We have this experience that is sort of riding on top of this really\
  \ deep and complex biological neural system. That conscious sheen is related to\
  \ the depths of what's going on there, but we don't really tend to have access to\
  \ it. I can't feel my stomach deciding when it wants to squirt out more enzymes\
  \ to digest my food, and I can't tell the difference between various things happening.\
  \ It's just not really available to me. Once you start learning about the bits and\
  \ pieces, you can begin mapping your conscious experiences to the things I will\
  \ be telling you that may be happening under the hood. One example that comes to\
  \ mind is a known phenomenon: when a person starts lifting weights for the first\
  \ time, if you've never been a weightlifting person, there is a thing that happens\
  \ where you can very quickly increase the amount of weight you can lift in a short\
  \ amount of time. This is because your body is learning how to fire all of your\
  \ motor units at once, which is not something you generally do in your daily life.\
  \ You have to learn how to exert maximal effort, and that is something that happens\
  \ at the level of recruiting motor units. So, when you now go to the gym and start\
  \ having that experience, you might feel, \"Oh yeah, I'm getting super strong.\"\
  \ You can map that experience onto the motor unit function I just described, but\
  \ that mapping exists in this weird cognitive space. It's not at the level of deep\
  \ awareness. You then have to ask, what would that even look like if it was? Over\
  \ time, when you're lifting weights, why do you hit a plateau? Eventually, you are\
  \ recruiting all of your motor units, and then you simply don't have enough muscle\
  \ to produce the force. That's the explanation for that beginner spike in performance.\
  \ You are not actually growing muscle mass in that period of time; you are just\
  \ learning how to use all the muscles that you have. Then you hit that plateau,\
  \ and it's like, okay, well now I am firing 100% of my muscle abilities, but my\
  \ muscles aren't strong enough to actually move my body. A lot of those plateaus\
  \ in performance can be tied back to physiological structures that change. The time\
  \ courses of improvement happen, you know, like growing more muscle takes time,\
  \ whereas learning how to fire motor units also takes time but not in the same way.\n\
  \nSo, there is a lot of depth in that area. That area I was just speaking of is\
  \ often referred to as neuromechanics. Neuromechanics is a relatively newly named\
  \ field. I would be curious to see if it is in that mesh terminology thing we learned\
  \ about last time. Neuromechanics, or neural mechanics, lies at the boundary of\
  \ neural activity and physics\u2014mechanics. For example, firing a motor unit to\
  \ create a spring force that moves the limb is a neuromechanical question. Then,\
  \ how that connects to the spinal Central Pattern Generators\u2014this is where\
  \ it starts to get murky. Is that still neuromechanics? These are unclear areas.\n\
  \nOn the other side of neuromechanics, you have biomechanics. Biomechanics is literally\
  \ Newton's Laws as they apply to biological systems, and we will be talking about\
  \ that to some level of specificity in the not-too-distant future. Let me finish\
  \ this up, and then we will discuss that.\n\nBiomechanics is related to the physics\
  \ of moving your body. We will particularly talk about descriptions of the body\
  \ that essentially remove any conception of biology from them, thinking about the\
  \ human as an object that weighs a lot and is balanced on a pretty narrow platform.\
  \ This is sort of a center of mass and base of support level of description of the\
  \ human body, which we will talk about in some detail pretty soon. Another thing\
  \ I haven\u2019t mentioned, but we will discuss, is evolution because all of these\
  \ systems are evolved systems. developed over billions of years to the form that\
  \ they currently are. In the same sense, you can describe the system as it stands\
  \ right now, but you're always going to be missing some of the story if you don't\
  \ think about it in the context of how it emerged. I haven't quite figured out a\
  \ lot of the things I'm talking about; these are the topics that will go into the\
  \ numbered lectures once I determine how I want to organize them. I'm going to be\
  \ extracting a lot of information from your conversations to figure out how to steer\
  \ those lectures. There are some key points that I will address no matter what you\
  \ want to do, and evolution is going to be one of those topics. Specifically for\
  \ us, I'm going to talk a little about the evolution of your eye, but a lot of my\
  \ particular interest lies in the evolution of your skeleton\u2014why our skeletons\
  \ have the peculiar shape that they do, and how we developed from our origins as\
  \ fish that turned into lizards, that turned into squirrels, that turned into monkeys,\
  \ that turned into apes, and finally into us. This evolutionary process matters\
  \ a lot. The evolution of our eye is another fascinating story. Our retina is backwards\
  \ in some interesting ways; it is not oriented in the direction you would expect.\
  \ You would think that the light-sensing aspects would face towards the light, but\
  \ they are actually backwards, facing inward. They must bounce through, and this\
  \ is believed to be related to when we crawled out of the ocean and our eyes kind\
  \ of inverted to allow the same kind of refraction to happen. We did not discuss\
  \ eye movements in this particular story, but we will talk about them in detail.\
  \ We humans have very mobile eyes, which is a cornerstone aspect of our visual system\u2014\
  our eyes move a lot. This is part of the motor system, which allows us to move any\
  \ part of our body, including the eyes, and that specific area is called oculomotor\
  \ control. Oculomotor refers to eye movements, and it overlaps significantly with\
  \ visual perception and perceptual neuroscience, because as we move our eyes, the\
  \ information on the retina changes. We have to make decisions about where to move\
  \ our eyes in the same way that we decide where to move our arms. You can live a\
  \ whole happy life and never really think about your eye movements, but once you\
  \ start thinking about them, you'll realize that it's a significant observation.\
  \ To me, it feels a lot like breathing, where usually your breathing is something\
  \ that just happens on its own, but you can control it to some extent. I can hold\
  \ my breath, I can take a breath; I have volitional control over my breathing in\
  \ a way that I don't over my heart. Our eye movements are kind of like that as well.\
  \ I can choose to look in one direction or another, and I can choose not to look\
  \ at something, but for the most part, for 99.9% of my waking life, my eyes are\
  \ just doing what they do, driven by a combination of available visual information\
  \ and my desires. Sometimes, if I throw something in the air, I will look at it\
  \ and then catch it; a lot of that process is happening just below the level of\
  \ conscious awareness. \n\nI think this is a nice segue into what we\u2019re going\
  \ to talk about for the last ten minutes, which is methods and methodologies. \"\
  Methods\" is just the term we use for how, in God's name, we are going to study\
  \ any of this. Generally speaking, when we talk about methods, we're discussing\
  \ equipment and ways that we can make empirical measurements of the world that will\
  \ give us information about parts of the world from which we might glean some insight.\
  \ These deeper, weirder aspects of our investigation can be referred to as desirata.\
  \ Desiderata means that which is desired and is a sort of philosophy of science\
  \ term about what you are trying to figure out. You came into this room as a scientist\
  \ because there is something you want to know more about\u2014there's some part\
  \ of the world you want to gain insight into. What is that thing, and how can you\
  \ study it given all the limitations, constraints, and difficulties of how the world\
  \ is?\n\nFor me, in my domain of inquiry, I use two primary research tools: motion\
  \ capture, which is the thing you see in behind-the-scenes footage in movies and\
  \ video games, where individuals wear suits with dots. That's motion capture, and\
  \ it's basically related to recording the movements of the body in space. I will\
  \ be at one of the lab sections, and I will be bringing in some cameras to do a\
  \ FreeO Cap recording. This is the open-source software that I have been building,\
  \ which is designed to help record the body with a high degree of fidelity. It captures\
  \ the specific three-dimensional configuration of the body at any given moment in\
  \ time. I would love to study all the brain activity of the pinging cells in the\
  \ cerebellum, but that is not available to me in this year of Our Lord 2025. I can't\
  \ actually obtain that measurement, and the methods I could use, even if we could\
  \ get that from something like fMRI\u2014 which is the tube that produces colorful\
  \ images of the brain\u2014 do not allow me to have a person out in the world throwing\
  \ and catching and performing other activities simultaneously. Therefore, we use\
  \ motion capture as a methodology to record the 3D configuration of the body over\
  \ time. Then, we analyze those movements to infer that if the arm did this, and\
  \ gravity is acting a certain way, then the muscles must have performed specific\
  \ actions to generate that movement. We essentially backtrack: if the muscles did\
  \ this, then the spine must have done that. This process allows us to utilize observable\
  \ aspects of reality, such as the location of the arm, and measure it to the level\
  \ of fidelity possible with current technology. We then use these empirical measurements\
  \ to infer complex functions of various parts of the brain. Another technology I\
  \ frequently employ is eye tracking, which is always a crowd favorite. There are\
  \ different tools available, but mainly, we use video-based eye trackers, which\
  \ are essentially small cameras focused on the eyes. Humans have highly mobile eyes,\
  \ which provide intriguing insights into what my brain seeks to learn at any given\
  \ moment. For example, if you give me a task like walking over rough terrain or\
  \ juggling, you can observe the movements of my eyes and deduce the visual information\
  \ available to me at that moment by creating a 3D model. If my eye moved this way,\
  \ and the object was over there, you can ascertain whether I could see it or not\
  \ at that time. Periphery. Then I chose to make a movement that would align my eye.\
  \ Now it's in my phobia. You can use a camera pointed at the eye to tell the information\
  \ that was being transmitted into my visual cortex, sort of going down that way.\
  \ This gives you the information that I had available, and more importantly, the\
  \ place that my eyes move to indicates where my central nervous system decided it\
  \ wanted more information from this part of the world. Because those eye movements\
  \ tend to happen really fast\u2014around 150 milliseconds per eye movement\u2014\
  if you're doing a difficult task, this occurs well below the level of conscious\
  \ awareness. We can tell stories about what we were doing after the fact, but in\
  \ the moment, the eyes just kind of go where they need to go. I can tell both what\
  \ information was available to this weird magical meat robot at any moment in time\
  \ and the decisions that were made about where to move my eyes\u2014this way and\
  \ not that way\u2014based on where my central nervous system desired more information\
  \ from in the world at any moment. By combining these aspects of measuring perceptual\
  \ input in the form of eye tracking and motor output in the form of motion capture,\
  \ this is my general approach to scientific research. I try to merge these two methodologies\
  \ to create a picture of what a given human is doing in the world as they perform\
  \ complex actions. I then use that data that pours out of those machines to gain\
  \ insights into these processes. Often, in my case, this type of research provides\
  \ ecologically valid data\u2014realistic data of real people doing real tasks. However,\
  \ the fidelity is limited; the accuracy and precision of the information that I\
  \ can provide with these methods are far more restricted compared to someone in\
  \ a lab who is analyzing individual neurons and engaging in reductionist work to\
  \ obtain very precise numbers. The sociology of science involves people like me,\
  \ who do broad-scope research, collaborating with those who focus on careful reduction\
  \ of data. Ideally, we work together to tell more complete stories and provide more\
  \ satisfying narratives about what is happening for humans to new generations of\
  \ undergraduates every couple of years. Okay, is all of that covered? No more questions?\
  \ Neuroscience nailed it. Great! Well, actually, that's it. We do have three more\
  \ minutes. Does anyone have any questions or any emotional outbursts, existential\
  \ crises, or things you wish I had said more about? No one seems to be saying anything\
  \ in this moment in class. I appreciate\u2014oh, you do like the opson thing? Yeah,\
  \ opson is the term. Opsin reminded me of\u2014yeah, it's the same. I mean, plants\
  \ don't really have the motor aspect, but that's for the biochemistry people. I\

    \ the poster proposal assignment, will be a one or two sentence write-up on the\
    \ topic area that you want your poster to focus on, along with a singular citation\
    \ of a paper that represents the research in that area. \n\nThe standard assignment\
    \ for 22.99 is for you to pick a singular paper for the whole semester, and your\
    \ poster will be you presenting just that paper. I think we can go a little beyond\
    \ that if you want to, but I also think it\u2019s valid to focus on just one paper.\
    \ However, I would like to keep us honest, so I\u2019m going to ask you to pick\
    \ a singular paper. The bot-mediated conversation will be designed to help you\
    \ with that. You can give it your topic, a paper you're considering, and its abstract.\
    \ I will program the bot to ask you questions similar to what I would if I had\
    \ the time and energy to discuss it one-on-one. \n\nBehind the scenes, when discussing\
    \ this class, we are generally advised to help you avoid choosing a review article\
    \ for your paper and instead focus on a proper empirical research article. When\
    \ you search for papers on a given topic, review articles often appear at the\
    \ top of the list, and it\u2019s not always obvious whether you\u2019re looking\
    \ at a review, a book chapter, or an empirical study. I can direct the bot to\
    \ assist you with that by asking about methodologies and topics, helping you parse\
    \ the dense language typically found in abstracts or scientific papers. \n\nThere\
    \ will also be a simple checkbox-style assignment on Canvas and a Discord server-based\
    \ conversation space. These will be due next week, meaning 11:59 PM on Sunday\

    \ own research background, and the studies that I've done. By the time you have\
    \ lived long enough to develop specialties and personal experiences, you will\
    \ have charted your own path and trajectory into the heart of some field or domain.\
    \ For pretty much all of you, everyone who chooses to follow a route like that,\
    \ you will have a unique path. Each person's path will be different, and the topics\
    \ that are relevant to everyone\u2019s interests will also be different. \n\n\
    I don't want to present this material as if I am saying, \"Here is everything\
    \ that matters; here is everything that is relevant to this topic.\" I really\
    \ want to keep it on a relatively personalized narrative, focusing on the topics\
    \ that are most important for me to study human perceptual-motor neuroscience\
    \ in the specific ways I have learned. I will discuss this in the context of the\
    \ component pieces of my particular specialty. \n\nThe beauty of using AI-mediated\
    \ tools in a classroom setting is that, in a traditional class, the professor\
    \ lays out the curriculum, the structure, and the topic area, and then everyone\
    \ is constrained to follow that structure. This is largely for practical reasons;\
    \ it is too difficult and requires too much human labor to mediate and navigate\
    \ the varying interests of people in a room, even one labeled under a specific\
    \ course title. \n\nHowever, I believe with AI, limited though it may be, it will\
    \ always do its best to make your interests relevant to the topics that I have\
    \ mandated it should care about. So as I start going through this material, I\
    \ encourage you to really tune into your own personal feelings of interest, to\
    \ notice what draws you in or moves you about a particular topic or domain. If\
    \ you want to follow the trajectories that I'm presenting, that's all well and\
    \ good. However, even if you wanted to, it wouldn't happen that way because that's\
    \ not how the world works. As I give this lecture, keep that in mind."

    \ everything that I'm saying; rather, the goal is to expose you to it. \n\nAs\
    \ I start talking, don't get too hung up on whether or not you're following everything.\
    \ Just try to remember the words as much as you can and let it wash over you.\
    \ I promise you that some of it will stick. When we open things back up, you can\
    \ start asking questions about the parts that you found most interesting. \n\n\
    What I have found most gratifying about doing this type of class is the discovery.\
    \ Every time I give a lecture on a given topic and then tell 40 students to ask\
    \ questions about the parts they found most interesting, I typically see 40 different\
    \ conversations about 40 different topics. That's really a lot of fun. \n\nWith\
    \ that said, let us get into it. Unfortunately, I intended to bring a tablet so\
    \ I could draw things with colors, and I brought the tablet, but when I looked\

    They are all part and parcel of a particular philosophical tradition that is fundamental
    to the way we conduct scientific research in 2025 on Earth. This tradition is
    so ingrained that we often don't even think about it, and that is the concept
    of reductionism. Reductionism is a general philosophical approach to the study
    of the natural world that tries to break things down into smaller and smaller
    pieces. This allows for more precise measurements and more detailed investigations.
    The implicit assumption is that by analyzing the component parts of the world,
    we will gain a better understanding of how everything works. There is a lot of
    validity to that approach, but there are also significant limitations. If you're
    only examining the smaller pieces in isolation, you will struggle to see what
    we call emergent properties. These properties only emerge when we observe the
    combination of parts at a larger scale than what can be contained in a test tube
    or viewed under a microscope. A classic example of emergence is traffic. Traffic
    is a property of cars on a road, but you can never understand traffic by looking
    at just one car. It is only when you observe the cars operating together in their
    natural environment that you begin to grasp the concept of traffic. The counter
    to reductionism might be termed holism, which is the scale where my research domain
    tends to operate. I do not focus on studies involving highly reduced approaches,
    such as electrophysiology, where electrodes are inserted into the brains of various
    animals, or fMRI studies where participants are placed in a tube to measure the
    magnetic resonance of their hemoglobin in their brains. Instead, my research focuses
    on humans behaving in natural environments and performing the kinds of activities
    we do in our day-to-day lives. For example, throwing objects into the air and
    catching them involves motor behavior, applying force to the object, an information-gathering
    phase, and then executing another motor command. If this command aligns with the
    world, the action succeeds; if not, the object falls. My research is centered
    on understanding these complex interactions and behaviors.

  text: "That behavioral process in its natural context involves using the best measurements\
    \ I can devise for those behaviors. I try to connect these measurements to the\
    \ more low-level, reductionist fields of inquiry so that we can understand how\
    \ elements like cells and neurons can lead to complex behaviors. I think of it\
    \ as a robotics approach. I like to tell people that I study the part of neuroscience\
    \ that overlaps with robotics; robotics is a field that keeps you honest in the\
    \ sense that you create things that move around in the real world. You can't cut\
    \ corners because if you do, the robot just stops working. The difference is that\
    \ we know how robots work because we made them, while humans can do things we\
    \ don't fully understand. This combination\u2014thinking of humans as magical\
    \ meat robots\u2014allows us to study and comprehend them from this perspective,\
    \ which can yield useful insights. The nice thing about this approach is the abstraction\
    \ away from the biology, even though we know it involves cells, neurons, membrane\
    \ potentials, and so forth. We think more in terms of the measurable aspects,\
    \ which we will discuss shortly.\n\nSo, speaking of the natural world, let's talk\
    \ about something that helps parse out that general topic, which is called the\
    \ perception-action cycle. Let's start by drawing a brain. I'm trying to draw\
    \ it... yes, let's do it like this. Here's how you draw a brain. There you go.\
    \ This is a picture of your brain. That's your temporal lobe, and this is your\
    \ eye, facing that way. There are many details not covered here, but this is the\
    \ general shape. So here you are\u2014that's you, and your existence."

  text: "In the world, let's do this in a different way. There you go. That's you.\
    \ You're in the world. Here\u2019s your body; here\u2019s your eye; here\u2019\
    s your mouth. And then inside of there, that\u2019s your brain, not to scale.\
    \ As you are in the world, you have a very limited awareness of your given context,\
    \ and everything that you know comes in through your senses and your memory.\n\
    \nSo, let\u2019s think about a particular moment in time where you\u2019re sitting\
    \ here. You have your eye, and then you see out here, there\u2019s a cat. You\
    \ like cats. So, light from the sun bounces off the cat and goes into your eye.\
    \ We will talk a lot about eyes; we\u2019ll discuss the lens, the retina, the\
    \ fovea, and the optic nerve. The main thing to understand is that your eye is\
    \ the place where environmental energy is first absorbed by your nervous system.\
    \ This moment right here is a very special moment in your perceptual cycle, which\
    \ is the moment of transduction. This term refers to the moment when some form\
    \ of environmental energy, in this case, light, gets transduced and converted\
    \ into neural activity in your eye. The light goes in, into your retina, into\
    \ your fovea, which we will talk about plenty.\n\nThere\u2019s a particular class\
    \ of molecules called opsin. Opsins look roughly like this: they are made of carbon\
    \ and hydrogen, forming a hexagon with a long, wiggly tail. People in biochemistry\
    \ are probably familiar with these shapes, except this is not drawn well. You\
    \ have a bunch of these opsins in your eye, and there are basically three main\
    \ ones. They are tuned \u2014 if you want to use that term \u2014 to different\
    \ wavelengths of light."

  text: Wavelengths of light and their nature indicate that when a photon of light
    hits them, they absorb the energy of that photon and then change shape. I think
    I actually did this backward; I think they start out with a kink, and then when
    they absorb the light, they straighten out. However, regardless of the specifics,
    this absorption of a photon changes the electrochemical properties of the molecule,
    causing it to transition from being neutral to plus one, minus one, or whatever
    it is. The point is that the light coming from the environment, bouncing off the
    cat, entering your eye, changes the chemical layout of the opsin. This occurs
    in trillions and billions of instances, as biology tends to operate on this scale.
    This change alters the polarity and electrical state of the rods and cones in
    your retina, which then get accumulated with ganglia and various other components.
    This leads to a shift in the electrical potential in that section of your retina,
    which is then sent as spikes down your optic nerves. Neurons are the fundamental
    building blocks of neuroscience, and mostly what neurons do is spike; they send
    little electrical pulses to communicate whatever stimuli they have detected. In
    the context of perception and vision, the absorption of light into the opsin and
    the consequent shift in polarity and electrical state ultimately results in changes
    in the spike rate of a given ganglion cell as it sends its axon down the optic
    nerve to your occipital lobe and the visual cortex. We will discuss this in more
    detail and coherence later, but the key takeaway here is that the light absorbed
    by your eye is subsequently converted through this complex biochemical mechanism
    into a pattern of neural activity. Since the neural activity is triggered by the
    light, and because the light has been reflected off the object in question, there
    is a prevailing belief and assumption that the pattern of neural activity corresponds
    in some way to the object in the real world. There is some statistical correlation
    or relationship present in the pattern of neural activity.

    \ The nature of that relationship is tenuous and complex, and, generally speaking,\
    \ extremely impoverished. The actual information we're getting in any moment in\
    \ time is far less than you think it would be. It's a lot, but the richness of\
    \ your visual environment, for example, is very much an illusion based on your\
    \ brain's ability to sort of cobble together a lot of noisy information to give\
    \ you something that's accurate enough to move through the world, but often in\
    \ a way that's almost exclusively designed after the fact.\n\nSo, that's your\
    \ brain again. It's more like a mashup but that's fine. The light comes into your\
    \ eye, gets absorbed by the retina, which is on the back of your eye. It sends\
    \ a pattern of neural activity down your optic nerve, passing through some subcortical\
    \ areas, the thalamus, and so on, which we won't talk about too much. There is\
    \ some processing that happens in that area.\n\nThen, the information projects\
    \ down to the occipital lobe, otherwise known as the visual cortex, which is located\
    \ at the back of your brain. It's not super important to know where it is, but\
    \ it's just one of those things where vision happens at the back of the brain\
    \ for whatever reason. This is the place where the first pass of information about\
    \ your visual environment starts to get computed. This information is mostly in\
    \ the form of edges, dark patches, light patches, and similar attributes.\n\n\
    Once you get from V1, which is the primary visual cortex, the information goes\
    \ through other stages of processing, leading to progressively more complex structures\
    \ emerging. For example, you start with things like edges, and if you have enough\
    \ edges, you can discern patches. With patches, you can perceive textures, and\
    \ with textures, you can recognize objects. Each stage of visual processing builds\
    \ on the previous stage, eventually leading to the ability to do things like object\
    \ recognition, such as identifying that something out there is a cat.\n\nThere\u2019\
    s a discussion to be had about the parts of that process that occur in the temporal\
    \ lobe, which is here. This tends to be the area responsible for identifying objects,\
    \ like saying, \"That's a desk,\" or, \"That's a computer.\""

    in this direction, which tends to be more in tune with using that information
    to plan your movement out in the world. Something that I haven''t said yet, but
    which is important to repeat, is that this is a cartoon; this is a very abstracted,
    simplified version of a story. If you wanted to tell the whole story, you would
    have to recount a thousand stories of a thousand humans in their labs recording
    data, gathering numbers, and making up their own stories in the discussion sections
    of their papers about what the different parts mean. This cartoonified story is
    the version that tends to make it into the textbooks that we communicate back
    to you in an attempt to make sense of any of it. However, it is really important
    that we remember this is not the real story; this is the cartoon, and the real
    story is something to which we do not actually have access. There is no level
    of class where I can simply give you the book that says, "Here is what the visual
    cortex is actually doing." The best I could do is provide you with a record of
    all the empirical measurements that all the researchers who have investigated
    this topic have put together. Then, I can tell you the story that we have collectively
    decided is the best account of how we think this part of this lumpy pink matter
    inside of our skulls operates. But there is an essential gap between epistemology,
    which is our knowledge of things, and metaphysics, which involves what actually
    exists. The two concepts never truly touch; there will always be a difference
    between knowing something and what that thing actually is. Throughout the history
    of science, we have told many stories about what we think is going on in the world,
    in our bodies, and in our biological processes. Historically, every single one
    of those stories has been proven wrong, in some sense, over a long enough time
    scale. Everything we currently think will eventually be shown to be inaccurate
    in some way or another. We have evidence for that, given that everything we''ve
    ever believed up until this point has been proven wrong in some way. So, if you
    think there''s something special about today that will prevent this from continuing
    indefinitely until the sun burns out, consider this: the beauty of the scientific
    process lies in our belief that, despite everything being incorrect, each successive
    idea is less wrong than the one before it.'

    \ getting into motor actions and movements, the outgoing parts of things. As we\

    \ a motor plan. Many of you have been discussing concepts like muscle memory in\
    \ the chats. Muscle memory is a term we commonly use; it\u2019s a standard human\
    \ expression. However, physiologically, muscle memory doesn\u2019t truly exist.\
    \ Your muscles don\u2019t have memory; they are much simpler objects, which we\
    \ will also discuss. Usually, when you mention muscle memory, you are referring\
    \ to a motor plan. As you work on something more and gain expertise and experience,\
    \ what we tend to call muscle memory is actually the motor plans becoming more\
    \ robust and more locked in. Typically, much of that motor planning takes place\
    \ not necessarily in the motor cortex but in subcortical regions. If you think\
    \ about a picture of the brain, the pink wrinkly structure in your skull is your\
    \ cortex, specifically the neocortex, which is the part where most processing\
    \ happens. We will talk a little about what processing means in this context,\
    \ but I like to describe it as the bloom of the rose on the rose bush when discussing\
    \ the nervous system."

  text: When you're looking at a rose bush, it makes a lot of sense that we tend to
    focus on the rose, like the red thing with petals that smells nice. We spend a
    lot of our time focusing on that part of the plant for very good reason. However,
    if you really take a step back and look at it from a botany point of view, it's
    mostly bush and just a little bit of rose. I think that's kind of the same with
    the way our cortex works. The majority of our central nervous system is not in
    that cortex; it's in the subcortical regions. Among my favorite of those subcortical
    regions is the cerebellum, which sort of sits at this fist-shaped area right below
    your cortex. When you look up pictures of the brain online, you'll see the big
    pink wrinkly thing along with this more dense, grayish-looking structure underneath
    it. That's your cerebellum. Your cerebellum is a very complicated beast; it contains
    about 3.5 times as many neurons as the rest of your central nervous system combined.
    That number is strangely conserved across different animals, particularly mammals.
    We all have a cortex and a cerebellum, but we have very different brain-to-body
    ratios and different proportions. However, in general, whatever the size of your
    brain and whatever animal you are, your cerebellum has three and a half times
    as many neurons as the rest of your cortex. I always come back to that; it seems
    interesting that you find this number in nature that's conserved across a bunch
    of different species. I wish I knew more about it. One part of the reason why
    the cerebellum has so many more neurons by count is that the neurons associated
    with it are tiny. You have granule cells and you have Purkinje cells. Let's look
    up pictures because Purkinje cells in your cerebellum are one of the more beautiful
    parts of your brain. You have the cell body, the axon, and then there are thousands
    upon thousands of synapses. This picture is famous; it was actually taken by...

    \ 1909. Before that, we didn't really know what neurons were; we didn't know if\
    \ they were just one big mass or if they were individualized pieces. There was\
    \ a big scientific and philosophical debate about whether the brain is one big\
    \ connected piece or whether the neurons touch or are separated from each other.\
    \ Ramon Kahal argued in favor of the synapse doctrine, which said that there was\

    \ everything is touching. Golgi developed a silver nitrate staining process that\

  text: Cascade vibrated your visual cortex and gave you the perception of a cat.
    Your volitional desire to touch the cat, combined with the knowledge that there
    is a cat in front of you, started creating a motor plan. This is where the process
    becomes quite complex, as there is a lot of controversy surrounding the different
    steps involved. Long story short, something in the combination of your motor cortex
    and your cerebellum, which is largely concerned with movement, plays a significant
    role. The cerebellum is thought to be related to tool use, which is a capability
    that humans possess; we can pick up an object and quickly learn the physics of
    it, utilizing it as a tool with specific characteristics. This ability is often
    considered a feature of the neocortex, which is the new part of the brain that
    is complicated and has a hierarchical nature to the motor system. At the higher
    levels, particularly in the frontal lobe, the plans become much more abstract.
    These include thoughts like "I'm thirsty" or "I wish I was drinking water right
    now." In order for that high-level volition to result in actions that lead to
    achieving my goal, there must be a narrowing down of specificity from that high-level
    volition to commands that will ultimately boil down to muscle firings to move
    my body through space. So, when I say, "Oh, I wish I had water," I see that there
    is water over there, and somehow that volition is converted into motor commands
    that move my legs. This positions my body so that I can move my arm; I understand
    how this object works, so I open it and I get to drink water. This process typically
    moves from the motor cortex, then to the cerebellum, which has connections to
    the brain stem. These connections can be quite intricate as they are wrapped around
    each other. The brain stem, including the medulla oblongata and pons, is often
    referred to as the part of the brain that regulates the so-called reptilian brain.
    This area handles essential functions such as heart rate, breathing, and regulating
    body temperature, which are managed at the level of the brain stem. The brain
    stem is also the beginning of the spinal cord.

    \ A central pattern generator is responsible for the basic rhythmic movement of\

    like that. For some reason, this really stuck with me. There was a puddle of dirty
    water in the middle of the parking lot that had this really beautiful oil sheen
    on top of it. It had these fractal iridescent colors. By the nature of oil, it''s
    only one molecule thick, which creates this very beautiful, vibrant, colorful
    shape on top of cold, dark, murky water. I think about that a lot when I think
    about the nervous system because it feels like that is kind of our experience
    of living in a body. We have this experience that is sort of riding on top of
    this really deep and complex biological neural system. That conscious sheen is
    related to the depths of what''s going on there, but we don''t really tend to
    have access to it. I can''t feel my stomach deciding when it wants to squirt out
    more enzymes to digest my food, and I can''t tell the difference between various
    things happening. It''s just not really available to me. Once you start learning
    about the bits and pieces, you can begin mapping your conscious experiences to
    the things I will be telling you that may be happening under the hood. One example
    that comes to mind is a known phenomenon: when a person starts lifting weights
    for the first time, if you''ve never been a weightlifting person, there is a thing
    that happens where you can very quickly increase the amount of weight you can
    lift in a short amount of time. This is because your body is learning how to fire
    all of your motor units at once, which is not something you generally do in your
    daily life. You have to learn how to exert maximal effort, and that is something
    that happens at the level of recruiting motor units. So, when you now go to the
    gym and start having that experience, you might feel, "Oh yeah, I''m getting super
    strong." You can map that experience onto the motor unit function I just described,
    but that mapping exists in this weird cognitive space. It''s not at the level
    of deep awareness. You then have to ask, what would that even look like if it
    was? Over time, when you''re lifting weights, why do you hit a plateau? Eventually,
    you are recruiting all of your motor units, and then you simply don''t have enough
    muscle to produce the force. That''s the explanation for that beginner spike in
    performance.'

    \ would expect. You would think that the light-sensing aspects would face towards\
    \ the light, but they are actually backwards, facing inward. They must bounce\
    \ through, and this is believed to be related to when we crawled out of the ocean\
    \ and our eyes kind of inverted to allow the same kind of refraction to happen.\
    \ We did not discuss eye movements in this particular story, but we will talk\
    \ about them in detail. We humans have very mobile eyes, which is a cornerstone\
    \ aspect of our visual system\u2014our eyes move a lot. This is part of the motor\
    \ system, which allows us to move any part of our body, including the eyes, and\
    \ that specific area is called oculomotor control. Oculomotor refers to eye movements,\
    \ and it overlaps significantly with visual perception and perceptual neuroscience,\
    \ because as we move our eyes, the information on the retina changes. We have\
    \ to make decisions about where to move our eyes in the same way that we decide\
    \ where to move our arms."

    \ but once you start thinking about them, you'll realize that it's a significant\
    \ observation. To me, it feels a lot like breathing, where usually your breathing\
    \ is something that just happens on its own, but you can control it to some extent.\
    \ I can hold my breath, I can take a breath; I have volitional control over my\
    \ breathing in a way that I don't over my heart. Our eye movements are kind of\
    \ like that as well. I can choose to look in one direction or another, and I can\
    \ choose not to look at something, but for the most part, for 99.9% of my waking\
    \ life, my eyes are just doing what they do, driven by a combination of available\
    \ visual information and my desires. Sometimes, if I throw something in the air,\
    \ I will look at it and then catch it; a lot of that process is happening just\
    \ below the level of conscious awareness. \n\nI think this is a nice segue into\
    \ what we\u2019re going to talk about for the last ten minutes, which is methods\
    \ and methodologies. \"Methods\" is just the term we use for how, in God's name,\
    \ we are going to study any of this. Generally speaking, when we talk about methods,\
    \ we're discussing equipment and ways that we can make empirical measurements\
    \ of the world that will give us information about parts of the world from which\
    \ we might glean some insight. These deeper, weirder aspects of our investigation\
    \ can be referred to as desirata. Desiderata means that which is desired and is\
    \ a sort of philosophy of science term about what you are trying to figure out.\
    \ You came into this room as a scientist because there is something you want to\
    \ know more about\u2014there's some part of the world you want to gain insight\
    \ into. What is that thing, and how can you study it given all the limitations,\
    \ constraints, and difficulties of how the world is?\n\nFor me, in my domain of\
    \ inquiry, I use two primary research tools: motion capture, which is the thing\
    \ you see in behind-the-scenes footage in movies and video games, where individuals\
    \ wear suits with dots. That's motion capture, and it's basically related to recording\
    \ the movements of the body in space."

    \ to do a FreeO Cap recording. This is the open-source software that I have been\
    \ building, which is designed to help record the body with a high degree of fidelity.\
    \ It captures the specific three-dimensional configuration of the body at any\
    \ given moment in time. I would love to study all the brain activity of the pinging\
    \ cells in the cerebellum, but that is not available to me in this year of Our\
    \ Lord 2025. I can't actually obtain that measurement, and the methods I could\
    \ use, even if we could get that from something like fMRI\u2014 which is the tube\
    \ that produces colorful images of the brain\u2014 do not allow me to have a person\
    \ out in the world throwing and catching and performing other activities simultaneously.\
    \ Therefore, we use motion capture as a methodology to record the 3D configuration\
    \ of the body over time. Then, we analyze those movements to infer that if the\
    \ arm did this, and gravity is acting a certain way, then the muscles must have\
    \ performed specific actions to generate that movement. We essentially backtrack:\
    \ if the muscles did this, then the spine must have done that. This process allows\
    \ us to utilize observable aspects of reality, such as the location of the arm,\
    \ and measure it to the level of fidelity possible with current technology. We\
    \ then use these empirical measurements to infer complex functions of various\
    \ parts of the brain. Another technology I frequently employ is eye tracking,\
    \ which is always a crowd favorite. There are different tools available, but mainly,\
    \ we use video-based eye trackers, which are essentially small cameras focused\
    \ on the eyes. Humans have highly mobile eyes, which provide intriguing insights\
    \ into what my brain seeks to learn at any given moment. For example, if you give\
    \ me a task like walking over rough terrain or juggling, you can observe the movements\
    \ of my eyes and deduce the visual information available to me at that moment\
    \ by creating a 3D model. If my eye moved this way, and the object was over there,\
    \ you can ascertain whether I could see it or not at that time."

    \ in my phobia. You can use a camera pointed at the eye to tell the information\
    \ that was being transmitted into my visual cortex, sort of going down that way.\
    \ This gives you the information that I had available, and more importantly, the\
    \ place that my eyes move to indicates where my central nervous system decided\
    \ it wanted more information from this part of the world. Because those eye movements\
    \ tend to happen really fast\u2014around 150 milliseconds per eye movement\u2014\
    if you're doing a difficult task, this occurs well below the level of conscious\
    \ awareness. We can tell stories about what we were doing after the fact, but\
    \ in the moment, the eyes just kind of go where they need to go. I can tell both\
    \ what information was available to this weird magical meat robot at any moment\
    \ in time and the decisions that were made about where to move my eyes\u2014this\
    \ way and not that way\u2014based on where my central nervous system desired more\
    \ information from in the world at any moment. By combining these aspects of measuring\
    \ perceptual input in the form of eye tracking and motor output in the form of\
    \ motion capture, this is my general approach to scientific research. I try to\
    \ merge these two methodologies to create a picture of what a given human is doing\
    \ in the world as they perform complex actions. I then use that data that pours\
    \ out of those machines to gain insights into these processes. Often, in my case,\
    \ this type of research provides ecologically valid data\u2014realistic data of\
    \ real people doing real tasks. However, the fidelity is limited; the accuracy\
    \ and precision of the information that I can provide with these methods are far\
    \ more restricted compared to someone in a lab who is analyzing individual neurons\
    \ and engaging in reductionist work to obtain very precise numbers. The sociology\
    \ of science involves people like me, who do broad-scope research, collaborating\
    \ with those who focus on careful reduction of data. Ideally, we work together\
    \ to tell more complete stories and provide more satisfying narratives about what\
    \ is happening for humans to new generations of undergraduates every couple of\
    \ years. Okay, is all of that covered? No more questions? Neuroscience nailed\
    \ it. Great! Well, actually, that's it."
