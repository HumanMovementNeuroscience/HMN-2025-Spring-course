full_transcript: "Okay, hello, hello, hello, hi. All right, let's do today. I guess\
  \ spring break is next week, so that's nice. I once again stand here before you\
  \ as a liar and a generally untrustworthy person because I said I would have the\
  \ stuff for this done by today. I don't. You know, I hit some, it's like, I once\
  \ again made an assignment that requires technical capacity that did not exist at\
  \ the time I made the assignment. So I'll give you a quick update on that. I should\
  \ have something done by Wednesday and then just push all the deadlines out. So\
  \ things will kind of be spread out over the next couple of weeks and you should\
  \ all be set up for it.\n\nThe content of the lecture today is going to be about\
  \ vision and eyeballs and sort of how that stuff generally works. We've covered\
  \ it a little bit in the overview at the beginning of the semester, but now we will\
  \ go a little more in depth. Some things that I probably hit pretty fast in passing,\
  \ I'll still hit pretty fast in passing but at a slightly slower rate. Then, next\
  \ Wednesday, so tomorrow's class, Wednesday class, I will bring in an eye tracker\
  \ and we'll do kind of an eye tracking demo, similar to the one I did with the motion\
  \ capture but less involved because all the cameras in that process are attached\
  \ to my head, so it's a little bit easier to set up.\n\nThen we'll have spring break,\
  \ and we'll go over that and the rest of the class. Let's see how much time I want\
  \ to do this. I think I will just give a quick update on my assignment for the course\
  \ of making sense of all your wacky nonsense. So, very quickly, the main technical\
  \ challenge here is that I want to do these exam chats, which I talked about last\
  \ week, but a lot of you weren't here, so I'll say it again. The goal is to create\
  \ some chat spaces on the server where the bot has been designed with the content\
  \ of the lecture I have been giving, recording, and putting online. There are two\
  \ forms of that chat set up. One is designed to help you as you work through your\
  \ chosen topic and try to connect the concepts we've discussed, particularly from\
  \ a philosophical perspective related to empirical measurement and what is being\
  \ recorded from the environment. The idea is to connect those thoughts to your chosen\
  \ topic. \n\nThe other version will be specifically tuned to assist you in coming\
  \ up with your second poster proposal, which is essentially an outline or schematic\
  \ form of your paper. This should state, \"This is my paper; these are the methods\"\
  \ and summarize the introduction, methods, results, and discussion in two sentences\
  \ or less. This outline will form the content of the poster you are submitting.\
  \ \n\nThe poster draft is due the week after spring break. I will find time in class\
  \ to review what you have and answer questions. The draft is not the final version.\
  \ The intention is that it is a completed poster that you could print and present\
  \ if necessary. However, we will allow some time for revision so you can discuss\
  \ it with your classmates and improve it. This means if you have changes you want\
  \ to make, you can do that before the final submission. The final poster will need\
  \ to be uploaded and printed by March 25th, so it's important you feel ready for\
  \ it, as once it's printed, it is permanent.\n\nThe technical aspect involves condensing\
  \ down the lectures into a format that can fit into the prompt of an AI bot. For\
  \ passive education purposes, I will point out where that is happening in the course\
  \ repository. At this point, I think there are about six recorded lectures. Each\
  \ lecture lasts somewhere between an hour to an hour and a half, so that's a lot\
  \ of words from a human being. At this point in history and in my personal development,\
  \ it is relatively easy to pull the spoken content from a video on YouTube into\
  \ a text-based format. However, there are a couple of challenges. For one thing,\
  \ the number of words spoken in an hour and a half is significantly higher than\
  \ the actual meaningful content being expressed. Additionally, when we speak aloud,\
  \ we do not typically speak in grammatically correct sentences. If you were to write\
  \ down what I'm saying, it might sound like a person having a stroke. We may feel\
  \ like we are speaking in grammatical form, but we are not. \n\nI have been writing\
  \ some AI code, which is a bit sloppy by my own standards but gets the job done.\
  \ This code first processes the content by breaking it down into ten-minute sections.\
  \ Then it sends each section to an AI that cleans it up, removing filler words and\
  \ turning it into grammatical sentences. The code functions similarly to copy-pasting\
  \ text into a Discord bot, except it operates in an automated way. For an hour-long\
  \ lecture, which is chunked into ten-minute segments, there are a total of six segments.\
  \ This process runs in a loop, taking the lectures and cleaning them up.\n\nThe\
  \ first part of the process pulls the content from YouTube, and then I take those\
  \ chunks and boil them down into an outline format. At this point, the information\
  \ has been condensed enough to be included in a bot chat. The idea is that having\
  \ a conversation with the bot, prompted by all this material, will provide a somewhat\
  \ crude simulation of what it would be like to work through these topics one-on-one,\
  \ which I would love to do. However, the realities of numbers make that difficult.\
  \ If you're curious about this, you can look at the repository. The lecture transcripts\
  \ contain all the words I've said to you, and it is an ongoing project. The exam\
  \ chats involve asking you to pull in the profiles that have been extracted about\
  \ you. We have talked about this before, but in these lectures, the chats you've\
  \ been having with the bot are part of the process. I periodically scrape the server,\
  \ extract those chats, and then try to compile them into the bot to determine your\
  \ interests and focus, as well as suggest things you might want to look into and\
  \ think about. This has been ongoing.\n\nThe latest update, which I won\u2019t go\
  \ into detail about at this moment, includes a zip file of the latest server-wide\
  \ analyses available on Discord in the designated channel. This zip file contains\
  \ two folders. One folder includes student profiles based only on your chats from\
  \ the assignments category. These are the chats you were specifically prompted to\
  \ engage with. The other folder uses all the chats you've had in total, incorporating\
  \ every chat you participated in.\n\nIn the zip file, you will find links and resources.\
  \ This server scrape checkpoints folder includes data from everything that happened\
  \ before about 8:00 a.m. this morning. The profiles in that folder are based on\
  \ every chat that includes your ID, which means it covers all class assignments\
  \ and all related discussions. On the other hand, the profiles from the assignments\
  \ channel only consist of chats that are specifically within the assignments category.\n\
  \nI just realized that I might have made a mistake in filtering, so both folders\
  \ might actually contain all of your chats because I could have filtered by channel\
  \ instead of by category. I will need to confirm that. This would be easy to fix.\
  \ However, I won't dig into that right now, but if you want to check and compare\
  \ the contents of both folders, if they are identical, then I know I made an error.\
  \ If they are different, that\u2019s part of the analysis that we can explore further.\
  \ The exam is a chat-based assessment. Part of that assignment involves pulling\
  \ in that profile and copying and pasting it into the chat so that you are not starting\
  \ from scratch. This will be one of those things where I will show you the high\
  \ water mark for that, and you can choose how you want to take that file, edit it,\
  \ delete things you don\u2019t think are appropriate, and add things you think are\
  \ necessary. I will probably make both of these formats available to you, and you\
  \ can mix and match for yourself. You can decide how you want to prompt the bot\
  \ to know who you are, or if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s useful, you can choose\
  \ not to do it at all and explain yourself again. Any questions about that? Does\
  \ that make sense roughly? Cool. Great. Well, let's talk about eyeballs. Eyeballs\
  \ live on your face. The average human has slightly less than two, and they are\
  \ generally very useful things. This is one of those lectures that I\u2019ve given\
  \ in various formats many times, and I've never really come up with my personal\
  \ favorite way of doing it. So this is just kind of a list of things I want to make\
  \ sure to hit. Let\u2019s start with a combination of drawing and things on the\
  \ screen. Okay, so we talked a little bit about vision at the start of the class,\
  \ but we have spent the majority of the time since then talking about motor control.\
  \ Motor control is essentially moving in the world. Roughly speaking, anything that\
  \ involves muscles and the generation of force that moves mass connected to your\
  \ body falls under the category of motor control. Motor refers to movement, and\
  \ it is certainly a good thing to be able to do. My particular area of expertise\
  \ in studying neuroscience and the neural control of movement is in... What is generally\
  \ called perceptual motor control, where the \"O\" in the middle means it's sort\
  \ of perceptual motor, is the connection between the perceptual systems of the body\
  \ and the motor systems of the body. These are two things that are often studied\
  \ to great effect in isolation of each other. However, in natural behavior, they\
  \ are not really separable in the same way. To move your body effectively in a complex\
  \ and dynamic world requires you to have good perceptual information about that\
  \ world. Knowing where things are is a very important component of planning your\
  \ motions and your movements effectively. Vision is a very classic sense; not every\
  \ animal uses vision entirely, and not every animal has vision as core to their\
  \ nervous system as we do, but it is a very classic environmental energy to be tapped\
  \ into. We are going to talk about the evolutionary elements of this at a later\
  \ point in the semester. Essentially, this has been around for as long as there\
  \ have been microbes or the ability to absorb photons from the world. Determining\
  \ dark areas from bright areas is something even single-celled organisms do, such\
  \ as rising to the top of a pool of water in the daytime and dropping down at night.\
  \ So, let's take a quick trip through the main pathways of the perceptual system.\
  \ Let's start with light itself. Light is covered by the study of light, which is\
  \ generally under the field of optics. Optics is the part of physics that involves\
  \ photons, refractions, lenses, and stuff like that. Historically, the origins of\
  \ the study of optics as a specific field are generally attributed to Alhazen, who\
  \ was in seventh-century modern Iraq. It wasn't called Iraq back then, but he was\
  \ a scholar in the seventh to ninth century; I can't remember exactly when. He was\
  \ the first person to start thinking about light specifically and to think about\
  \ light in the context of how it functions. Light travels in straight lines and\
  \ can be measured that way. The story goes that he created a pinhole camera. He\
  \ was in his tent in the bright sun and noticed that if there was a pinhole in the\
  \ otherwise opaque walls of the tent, he could see an image of the world projected\
  \ onto the other side of the tent. This phenomenon is known as a camera obscura\
  \ or pinhole camera. This was not the first time in history that this optical effect\
  \ was discovered; the original reference to it appears in ancient Chinese texts.\
  \ However, at that time, it was presented more as a documentation of a strange optical\
  \ effect than an understanding of why it occurred or what was going on with it.\
  \ There was less exploration into the underlying principles of the optics involved.\
  \ Ibn al-Haytham, known for writing the Book of Optics, provided a lengthy treatise\
  \ on the study of light and specifically how it interacts with the visual system.\
  \ He included some very accurate anatomical models of the early visual system. These\
  \ ideas were somewhat lost for about 500 to 600 years until Descartes came along\
  \ and translated much of this work. The main idea here was the discovery of light\
  \ as an entity that exists independently in nature. While people had always known\
  \ that light existed, it hadn't been studied precisely as a distinct natural entity.\
  \ In addition to his anatomical work, Ibn al-Haytham mapped out the basic geometries\
  \ of optical phenomena, including why images appear inverted in a pinhole camera,\
  \ which relates to the way light travels. All this is nice, sort of, you know, if\
  \ the light that's coming from the Sun and bouncing off the top of the Minette travels\
  \ down to that point, TR point, at the bottom, and then travels up to that point.\
  \ That's how you get the kind of inverted image there. You'll see this image a lot,\
  \ sort of like a projection in the eye. This is sort of classic textbook stuff where\
  \ you're presenting the images sort of backward, like upside down on the retina,\
  \ which is true, but I think it kind of misses some of the point. But that's fine.\
  \ One of the interesting things, one of the reasons why this guy is sort of considered\
  \ to be one of the scholars of history, is that he did a lot of that early work\
  \ on optics, and he hit most of the major points pretty straight off the bat, particularly\
  \ in the idea of projective geometry. Oh, it's this one I already have up. Oh yeah,\
  \ B2 projected. So like, this is the kind of epipolar geometry that is used behind\
  \ that motion capture thing and through the 3D projection, all that kind of stuff.\
  \ These are sort of representative images from modern software packages on how to\
  \ do computer vision, and most of the math for this was kind of worked out way back\
  \ then. The main thing that he didn't have, the main thing that he couldn't quite\
  \ figure out, was refraction and the way that light can... He understood that light\
  \ travels in straight lines, but he didn't really understand how lenses worked.\
  \ So when you look at some of these images of the eye, come on, man. Anyways, a\
  \ lot of the labels and stuff that happen in here are accurate to this day, except\
  \ for one thing that he kind of had wacky going on. In the lens of the eye, he believed\
  \ that there was a little demon that lived there and sort of bent the light to make\
  \ it make sense. I'm not saying that he believed there were demons living in your\
  \ eyes, but it was sort of like a placeholder. I think I've already said this in\
  \ this class, but it was kind of like a placeholder for 'I'm not sure what's happening.'\
  \ I understand that the straight line math doesn't work out because your eyes are\
  \ too small to do that kind of projection. It probably has to do with this little\
  \ thing right here, but I don't really understand how that part works. That kind\
  \ of projective geometry, that kind of refraction stuff, I don't quite know the\
  \ specific history there, but that was worked out much later. I suppose I should\
  \ also mention in the history of things that originally we believed that light\u2014\
  before we really understood light as this environmental thing\u2014vision was conceived\
  \ of as something that was emitted from your face. When you look at things, it's\
  \ called emission theory. They thought there were beams of not light, but beams\
  \ of something that shot out of your face when you looked at stuff, and that was\
  \ how you received sensory information from the world. In the same way that you\
  \ reach out with your limbs to touch things, they thought there was some kind of\
  \ invisible substance being projected from your eyes, and that touching things was\
  \ how you perceived the world. That was the dominant belief for a long time. During\
  \ the Black Death, they would do things like cover people's eyes when they were\
  \ sick because they knew you didn't want to touch sick people, as that would transmit\
  \ disease. So, they thought covering the eyes would ensure you didn't get hit with\
  \ the eye lasers. Anyway, that's kind of the old-school optics. These days, if you\
  \ take an optics course, I think that's in the engineering department, but I'm not\
  \ sure who teaches it\u2014probably physics. In optics, you'll learn about what's\
  \ called Snell's Law, which tells us all the things that can happen when light hits\
  \ a surface. As light is coming in with wavelengths and stuff like that, when it\
  \ hits a surface, it will either transmit (go straight through it), be absorbed\
  \ into the material itself, or reflect. So, transmission, absorption, and reflection\
  \ are the three things that light can do when it hits a surface, and every surface\
  \ in the world will... have properties related to this, and if it is transmitted,\
  \ transmission also has a refraction angle. Sometimes when light passes through\
  \ a surface, it goes straight through, and for other surfaces, it will refract by\
  \ a certain amount. The refraction angle depends on the angle at which it hits the\
  \ surface, as well as the index of refraction, which is a property that materials\
  \ possess. Substances like glass have a very low index of refraction, so when you\
  \ look straight through it, not much happens. Other surfaces, such as lenses, have\
  \ refractive aspects that bend the light to the point where it focuses. If light\
  \ hits the lens straight on, it goes straight through; if it comes in from an angle,\
  \ it is refracted. This is basically how a lens can focus light, and it is also\
  \ how cameras work and how glasses function. This outlines Snell's Law Optics of\
  \ what happens when light from the world first hits your eye.\n\nLet's do this\u2014\
  sure, yeah, nice. This is an eyeball or a picture of an eyeball, and we can use\
  \ this to figure things out. This is very much not to scale, but it does the job.\
  \ This is a side view of your eyeball. This thick part here looks very thick to\
  \ me; I don't know how accurate that is. But this thick part out here is called\
  \ the cornea. The cornea is the clear surface on the outside of your eye when you're\
  \ looking at somebody's eyes. We are looking at the corneas because that's the outermost\
  \ surface. It is thick and has refractive properties. When light comes in from the\
  \ world, the first thing it hits is the cornea. The majority of the refraction that\
  \ focuses the image on the back of your retina occurs passively due to the refractive\
  \ properties of the cornea. We will come back to that and look for a better picture\
  \ of this next part. Actually, this is the better picture. Here you go. This is\
  \ the cornea. This proportionality looks closer to me. There is also an empty space\
  \ that contains a lot of fluid-filled cavities in your eye, filled with a substance\
  \ called aqueous humor, which is basically a clear, gelatinous fluid. When light\
  \ hits your cornea, it is refracted; the number I remember is about 80% of the refraction\
  \ happens at the cornea level. This refraction occurs every time light hits a surface\
  \ with a different density than the one it is currently traveling through. Light\
  \ does not refract when it is moving through air, except when it bounces off water\
  \ molecules suspended in the air, which is why the sky is blue\u2014a whole other\
  \ conversation. For our purposes, we can assume that the refraction process occurs\
  \ every time there is a boundary between transmissive fluids of one density transitioning\
  \ to a different density. The first refraction point happens at the end of the cornea,\
  \ and then it goes through this opening here. This opening is called your pupil;\
  \ perhaps you've heard of it. The pupil is an interesting feature because it doesn't\
  \ have an independent existence; it is essentially the name we give to a void of\
  \ space. Your pupil is basically the opening. In the center of your iris is a sphincter\
  \ muscle, one of your body's finest sphincters. Its job is basically to open and\
  \ close to let through different amounts of light, relative to the environment you're\
  \ in. There's a lot of interesting reflexes that happen there. The main one you\
  \ probably think about is that when you're in a very bright room, your pupil constricts,\
  \ which lets through less light. When you're in a darker setting, your pupil expands,\
  \ which lets through more light. This has a lot of optical properties related to\
  \ the aperture, similar to photography. I won't go into too much detail about that.\
  \ \n\nThere are other factors that affect your pupil's dilation, such as aspects\
  \ of your physiology, including fear and relaxation. For example, if you get startled\
  \ or surprised, an adrenaline burst will constrict your pupils. There is a lot of\
  \ literature studying pupillometry; I think there\u2019s too much literature on\
  \ it. We'll discuss this in the context of the eye tracker on Wednesday. \n\nIt's\
  \ one of those things where, because it's fairly easy to measure pupil size with\
  \ an eye tracker, researchers can look at that signal independently from the actual\
  \ context in which it's occurring. As a result, there tends to be a sociological\
  \ effect where people study pupillometry and the effects of different emotional\
  \ states and stimuli on pupil size. This area is studied excessively, mostly because\
  \ it is relatively easy to research, so the field gets flooded with studies focusing\
  \ on that type of outcome. \n\nI'm not saying we shouldn't study it, but if you\
  \ go out and start looking at papers on eye tracking, you'll find a lot of papers\
  \ about pupillometry. You'll be forgiven for thinking this is the most important\
  \ thing to consider here. But resist that notion; it is not the most critical aspect.\
  \ It\u2019s fine, but let\u2019s switch pictures again. So, yes, the light is coming\
  \ through... Directions: You're always being hit by all the light that's bouncing\
  \ and scattering off of everything in the world. As that light bounces, it becomes\
  \ coupled with the things it's bouncing off of. If you really want to dig into the\
  \ quantum aspects of it, they show up here. When light bounces off of an object\
  \ of a given color, that color is absorbed, meaning the light that comes off of\
  \ it reflects that color. For example, if that wall back there is green, then when\
  \ the light bounces off of it, all the red wavelengths are absorbed, and the light\
  \ that comes off of it is green, assuming that the light in the environment is generally\
  \ white, which it usually is\u2014a broad spectrum. The light bouncing into my retina\
  \ from that part of the room has had all the red wavelengths sucked out of it, so\
  \ the light that comes in is only within the wavelength band that corresponds to\
  \ that bluish-greenish color of the back wall. That's jumping ahead a bit, but the\
  \ light comes through, refracts, and some of it makes it through the pupil. Aqueous\
  \ humor, there; humor is another one of those medieval science terms. Talk about\
  \ your humors and balance, stuff like that. So this is from that sort of era. Then,\
  \ once the light makes it to your pupil, it hits the second main refractive substance\
  \ in your eye, which is the lens. The lens looks like a little lens made out of\
  \ a clear structural biological material. It's not goop because the aqueous humor\
  \ is a goop. The lens is more of an object; it has its own structure, but it's elastic,\
  \ clear, and oblong in that way. It is also actively controlled. Your brain, at\
  \ some level, controls how much it should compress this lens. There are ligaments\
  \ attached, and I believe there are also muscles attached. The muscles pull the\
  \ lens to different shapes, and the different shapes have different refractive indexes.\
  \ If it's oriented one way, it refracts more, and when you pull it more elongated,\
  \ it refracts less. All of these factors change the focal point of the light. Traveling\
  \ through your eyes is relative to the point in space that you're fixating on. When\
  \ you're looking at something and it's in focus on the back of your eyes, where\
  \ \"in focus\" means that you can tell the difference between thin lines and similar\
  \ details, that focus implies that the focal point of the light is on your retina.\
  \ Your brain, using a variety of complex mechanisms, is going to try to stretch\
  \ and bend the lens structure to put that focal point on the back of your retina.\
  \ How does it know when things are in focus? How does it control it? What are the\
  \ feedback loops? These are all great questions that I can guess at, but I don't\
  \ really know, as I'm somewhat at my depth with some of this eye physiology stuff.\n\
  \nIt's also the case that you can control this yourself. This might be one of those\
  \ things like wiggling your ears, where not everybody can do it on their own, but\
  \ you can at least try. If you look at something and kind of fuzz it out, if you\
  \ look at an object and flex whatever muscle you need to make that object go in\
  \ and out of focus, you are controlling your lens. That's what you are flexing:\
  \ your lens. \n\nMany of you, including me, are probably wearing some sort of corrective\
  \ lenses\u2014glasses, contacts, or something similar\u2014because you might find\
  \ some shy medical information online suggesting that you can exercise the lens\
  \ muscle so you won't need glasses anymore. That is not actually true, due to the\
  \ sort of 80/20 division of labor. Remember, about 80% of the refraction occurs\
  \ at the cornea level, and the length of the eye only does a little more. So, you're\
  \ not going to be able to actively correct for the whole thing being out of whack,\
  \ such as with amblyopia, where your eye might be too oblong. If you're farsighted\
  \ your eye is too oblong, and if you're nearsighted, it's whatever shape that is.\
  \ The corrective lenses you have are basically augmenting the cornea. If you're\
  \ in contacts, you're putting another layer on top of it, or if you're in glasses,\
  \ you're using another lens to bend the light a bit before it even hits the retina,\
  \ ensuring the light is generally in focus on the back of your eye. Yes, that's\
  \ related to astigmatism, which I don't really understand fully. I know what you're\
  \ talking about, and it's important because astigmatism refers to a layer of optometry\
  \ that I haven't delved into deeply. The context involves contact lenses that sit\
  \ on top of the cornea; they have some kind of suction mechanism that slightly alters\
  \ the shape of the cornea to help change its passive refractive properties. This\
  \ effect lasts about a day, so you wear them overnight, and then when you wake up,\
  \ the results are quite surprising. We've advanced past the old technology of hard\
  \ contact lenses; in the past, contact lenses were hard glass objects. You have\
  \ a question about larger or stronger lenses, correct? Yes, astigmatism is related\
  \ to the shape of the overall eyeball, including the cornea itself. The shaping\
  \ that occurs at the eye involves the corneal shape. You definitely need to take\
  \ your contacts out for sanitation and hygiene purposes. However, regarding what\
  \ you mentioned, I'm not sure if that's accurate. If an eye doctor is saying that,\
  \ then maybe there's merit to it, but if not, I don't believe that is correct. As\
  \ someone who is also technically a doctor, I can state that I don't think that's\
  \ how it works. Your eyes change over time and eventually stabilize. For me, I was\
  \ getting different prescriptions every time I went to the doctor until I turned\
  \ 25, and then I settled on the same prescription since then. We also have very\
  \ different perspectives on how much focus and precision we expect from our vision.\
  \ I know people who wear glasses but don\u2019t use them, and they say, \"I can\
  \ see just fine.\" I can tell immediately their level of vision differs from mine.\
  \ I had a friend who was similar; we would look at something, and I would mention\
  \ I could see the sign that says the speed limit is 25. They would respond, \"You\
  \ can see that?\" We have distances beyond which we don't expect to see clearly.\
  \ For instance, if someone were holding up an 8.5 by 11-inch paper on the sidewalk,\
  \ I might see that they are holding something, but I wouldn\u2019t be able to read\
  \ it\u2014or that wouldn't bother me at all. I tend to get my contacts updated frequently,\
  \ which means I can read the street sign, while someone else who doesn\u2019t update\
  \ their prescription could say, \"I can\u2019t read that,\" but it wouldn't concern\
  \ me. If you stop wearing contacts or glasses, you'll become more comfortable with\
  \ not seeing things and can still lead a full and happy life. There are multiple\
  \ types of LASIK surgery. In some versions, they shave some of the cornea off, while\
  \ in others, they pull up a flap and insert something clear underneath. I don\u2019\
  t know the exact mechanics, but there are some measurements that involve shining\
  \ a laser through the eye and imaging it on the back of the retina. The aim is to\
  \ ensure that a laser point results in a precise point. If you look through it and\
  \ see diffusion or refraction, you can adjust accordingly. There\u2019s a fascinating\
  \ history behind this technology; it was originally created for spy satellites.\
  \ ...the cold war was when researchers began to focus on reading data from both\
  \ low and high earth orbit. It was after this period that they enlisted astronomers\
  \ to help look down from orbit, but then the technology was classified. Eventually,\
  \ they realized they could repurpose this technology for space telescopes. They\
  \ developed a method for Adaptive Optics that compensates for atmospheric distortion.\
  \ This involves shining a sodium laser into the atmosphere and adjusting the lens\
  \ until the point created by the laser appears as a perfect point. This allows us\
  \ to correct for distortions caused by the atmosphere and obtain clearer images.\n\
  \nInterestingly, this technology was later adapted for imaging through the retina.\
  \ I want to highlight that when discussing peripheral blindness, it's important\
  \ to note that there are various sources of this condition. Once we start addressing\
  \ peripheral blindness, we're usually looking at issues that occur beyond the cornea.\
  \ There are many disorders that can affect the eye, with everything in the eye potentially\
  \ going wrong. For instance, glaucoma involves hardening of the lens, which often\
  \ occurs with age.\n\nThere are surgical options for this condition. If you're interested\
  \ and not squeamish, you can find videos online of eye surgeries where doctors break\
  \ up a hardened, calcified lens and replace it with an artificial lens, usually\
  \ made of high-quality silicone. This approach has been quite effective, demonstrating\
  \ that in some areas of medical biology, we can successfully replace biological\
  \ components. Similarly, procedures like LASIK benefit from our understanding of\
  \ the physical properties that influence eye function, allowing us to control them\
  \ effectively.\n\nRegarding stem cells and whether they can assist with biological\
  \ issues, the answer is likely yes. The challenge with exploring this area...\n\
  \ Things like stem cells involve getting them to perform specific functions. One\
  \ area where stem cells are commonly used is in parts of the body that do not generally\
  \ heal on their own, which typically includes non-vascular tissue such as cartilage\
  \ and the meniscus found in the knees. Because there is no blood flow in these areas,\
  \ they do not heal like tissues where blood circulation is present. For example,\
  \ when you cut your arm, the healing process occurs because stem cells in your blood\
  \ attach to the damaged tissue and facilitate the healing. However, tissues like\
  \ cartilage do not have blood flow, which inhibits this type of natural healing.\n\
  \nThe eye does have vasculature, meaning it has some blood running through it, but\
  \ not significantly in the clear parts. I wouldn't be surprised to find research\
  \ about repairing eye damage over time with the help of stem cells. However, as\
  \ far as I know, there is nothing established in clinical practice. I would bet\
  \ they are conducting experiments on rats. The eye, like many other parts of the\
  \ body, can accumulate damage over time. This is why I tend to wear sunglasses outdoors\
  \ during the day. Ultraviolet light and blue light can cause damage to the sensitive\
  \ biological tissues in the eye. While the eye does have some ability to heal, particularly\
  \ in the neural areas at the back, it does not heal indefinitely. The rate at which\
  \ it heals may not keep pace with environmental damage.\n\nYou can dismiss the idea\
  \ that staring at bright lights for too long is inherently damaging. For example,\
  \ while staring directly at a bright light is not advisable, I don't believe that\
  \ regular TV exposure is significantly harmful. This ties into the study of how\
  \ we are exceptionally good at adapting to different light levels. If you look at\
  \ your phone in the middle of the night, the screen appears overwhelmingly bright.\
  \ Yet, in daylight, even on a cloudy day, you can barely see it due to the surrounding\
  \ light. The screen remains the same brightness, but your perception changes significantly\
  \ based on your environment and the lighting conditions around you. The screen is\
  \ the same brightness at either time; it's just the adaptation of your lens and\
  \ your visual system. This is a complicated process that involves more than just\
  \ your cornea; it adapts very well. For example, sitting too close to a TV makes\
  \ us feel like TVs are extremely bright, but they're nothing compared to being outside\
  \ on a sunny day. As for your eye doctor, I don't think the concerns about glasses\
  \ are valid. You should wear your glasses if you want to see well; it's not something\
  \ to worry about, like thinking you might be wearing them too much. That sounds\
  \ insane to me.\n\nNow, spending a lot of time discussing the eye doesn't bother\
  \ me, so let's cover most of the optical processes occurring in your eyeball. The\
  \ refraction and bending of light, focusing of the image\u2014this happens largely\
  \ through passive means at the level of the cornea, while the lens plays a more\
  \ active and reflective role. Once light passes through these optical components,\
  \ it has essentially completed its task, and your body will then process that information.\
  \ The signal from the environment, once it has traveled through these optically\
  \ non-neural surfaces, has not yet been converted into neural activity. However,\
  \ we are continually discovering new ways that the body responds to light. For instance,\
  \ it was recently discovered that some parts of the eye respond to blue light differently\
  \ than others, which are not part of the main visual system. This is thought to\
  \ be related to circadian rhythms.\n\nOnce we get past this stage, we start to delve\
  \ into the more interesting aspects from a neuroscience perspective, primarily the\
  \ retina. The retina is located at the back of your eye and serves as a crucial\
  \ component. That is the neural surface; that is the place where the light from\
  \ the world is actually first absorbed and converted into neural activity and patterns\
  \ of neural activity which are correlated with the light that comes through the\
  \ eye. The retina is a fascinating structure. Let's see, there\u2019s a nice picture.\
  \ \n\nThe first thing we'll talk about is the photoreceptors. Photoreceptors are\
  \ receptors for photons; they are part of your nervous system. These are the kinds\
  \ of neurons whose job it is to absorb light and convert it into electrical signals\
  \ in your eyes. You have two main types: rods and cones. Generally speaking, rods\
  \ are rod-shaped. \n\nRods and cones respond differently to light. Rods are generally\
  \ more sensitive to lower quantities of light, but they tend to saturate very quickly.\
  \ On the other hand, cones require much more light to operate, but they can function\
  \ over a much wider range. We refer to rods as the primary photoreceptors for night\
  \ vision, while cones are responsible for precision visual information. \n\nThis\
  \ is also pushing the limits of my anatomy knowledge. I\u2019m not sure about that\
  \ oil droplet; that's something new to me. However, these discs here are where the\
  \ opsins live. We\u2019ve talked about these before. I believe they start in a kinked\
  \ shape, and when the photons come in, they get absorbed and that changes the shape\
  \ of these strange chemicals. The absorption of the light initiates the process\
  \ of converting it into neural signals. A photon bumps the electron into a higher\
  \ orbital, which changes the ionic properties of the system. The general status\
  \ of how many of the opsin in the rod or cone in question have absorbed their favorite\
  \ wavelength of photon changes the electrochemical properties of the entire system.\
  \ The connected structures notice that a particular rod is ramped up; it has absorbed\
  \ a lot of its favorite kind of light. This is part of the cascade of neural activity\
  \ that represents your perceptual experience. I think this varies by animal, but\
  \ for us, our rods tend to be focused on green. Green is a good color to be sensitive\
  \ to since it is abundant on Earth. The cones associated with color vision are typically\
  \ represented as red, green, and blue. Generally, these correspond to short, medium,\
  \ and long wavelengths of light, where blue is short wavelength, red is long wavelength,\
  \ and green is in the middle. They all reside there and have a certain distribution.\
  \ Another thing to note is that this is the back of the eye, and light comes in\
  \ this way. You might expect that the part of the rods and cones most sensitive\
  \ to light would face the light, but that is not how it is set up. In fact, the\
  \ cones face away from the light, so light has to pass through several layers of\
  \ cells first. After the photoreceptors, there are middle layers followed by ganglion\
  \ cells. These cells are doing all sorts of complex processing. Textbook images\
  \ often make the visual system seem cleaner than it is. Our vision system is backwards;\
  \ it is the opposite of how you would expect it to be, and there are optical consequences\
  \ because everything we see is imaged through a couple of layers of dense cells.\
  \ culture, and that's thought to be related to when we first crawled out of the\
  \ oceans. The way that the light refracts is significant because our eyes are very\
  \ close in density to seawater, whereas they are very different from air. If you\
  \ have a visual system that first evolved in an environment that is roughly the\
  \ same density as your eye, you're going to need different refractive strategies.\
  \ For example, if you have an eye that essentially holds a little bubble of seawater\
  \ within itself, and then it refracts light that\u2019s traveling through an air\
  \ medium, it will behave differently.\n\nThings like cephalopods\u2014octopuses,\
  \ squids, and cuttlefish\u2014their eyes are oriented correctly and they have very\
  \ good vision. Their photoreceptors actually face outward, which is a curious aspect\
  \ of their anatomy. \n\nIt's also kind of amusing because, having given this lecture\
  \ many times before, I always realize that you could dedicate an entire session\
  \ just to discussing the eye. This is also the point in the lecture where I acknowledge\
  \ that I won\u2019t be able to delve into the neural parts of the visual cortex\
  \ as much as I would like. But that's okay. I tend to focus on what's important\
  \ regarding eye function.\n\nAs a consequence of the unique history of our eyes\
  \ having these flipped retinas, I won't go too deep into details about the outer\
  \ features, even though they are very interesting and deserve their own discussion.\
  \ If you're curious, you can look up more about the middle layers of the retina\
  \ and the ganglion cells.\n\nNow, I would say the most interesting part of the eye,\
  \ at least my favorite part, is this small divot in the back of the retina called\
  \ the fovea. 'Fovea' is Latin for 'pit.' It's the area that you point your eyes\
  \ at when you're focusing on something, like when you look at a nice cat, for example.\
  \ Here, that is pointing at your retina. So, the act of pointing my eyes at something\
  \ is basically lining up all this refractive machinery with this little pit on the\
  \ back of my eye, and that pit is called the fovea. Yes, there's an actual one.\
  \ There we go, like this guy right here. So, basically, this is a part of the eye\
  \ where all the extra stuff has been pushed out of the way to leave an unobstructed\
  \ viewpoint onto this portion of your eyeball, where there is, by very, very wide\
  \ margin, the highest density of photoreceptors in your eye.\n\nIf you look at your\
  \ eye, there are many ways that your eyes are not like cameras. One of the most\
  \ important ways is that with a camera, you have an equal... Yes, look at all. There\
  \ are always fun pictures here. Yes, this is a good representation of how focusing\
  \ works. It's like you're trying to constrain the world. It's not showing the refraction\
  \ at the cornea. This person was too inspired by the shape of the lens to understand\
  \ how that works. The bending should be happening here, and then this should be\
  \ kind of like extra.\n\nBut the distribution... So with a camera, the sensor on\
  \ the back of the camera has a roughly equal density of photosensitive silicone\
  \ pits. Your eye has a much, much different orientation. So if we're specifically\
  \ looking at your cones... There we go, like this. Yes, your cones, the red ones.\
  \ This is the one that we generally think of as when we think of your vision in\
  \ terms of how good is my vision. You\u2019re generally considering that in terms\
  \ of the behavior and performance of... Your cones and the distributions of cones\
  \ on the back of your retina resemble a sort of red spike. This represents eccentricity,\
  \ where zero is on the fovea, and then plus or minus however many degrees. You can\
  \ see that roughly 50% of your photoreceptors are in that ventral one degree of\
  \ your eye. If you were to look into the back of your retina and count all of the\
  \ photoreceptors, you would find that the vast majority are very densely packed\
  \ in that foveal central region of your eye. When you move your eyes around, you\
  \ are optimizing your eye movements to point this super high, super densely packed\
  \ region of photoreceptors at the object in question. This is also the area where\
  \ the core design of the retina has been mitigated by pushing out the structures\
  \ that obstruct it.\n\nSomething else you might notice is the distribution of the\
  \ cones versus the rods. The rods, shown in purple, pertain to your peripheral vision.\
  \ Their distribution is spread out to the periphery, which is thought to be for\
  \ several reasons. These rods respond to smaller amounts of light and tend to respond\
  \ faster. When we think about peripheral vision, its job is not to provide us with\
  \ precise levels of vision, like the ability to read text, but rather to give us\
  \ very fast information about external stimuli, which is important for things like\
  \ the startle response. Things that are looming objects from the outside trigger\
  \ a behavioral response, and that's often driven by the rods. This is also why,\
  \ if you're ever out in the dead of night looking at the stars, the best way to\
  \ see something, when your eyes are very dark adapted, is not to look directly at\
  \ it. In the middle of the night, your rods aren't really working very well, so\
  \ if you look directly at something, you're going to be getting less light than\
  \ you want. Astronomers learn that if you're interested in a particular star, the\
  \ best way to see it is to look a little bit off to the side of it and let your\
  \ rods do the work of providing the information from the incoming light. So next\
  \ time you're out on a nice starry night, you can try that out. For example, the\
  \ Seven Sisters, or Pleiades, is a cluster of stars where I've noticed this effect\
  \ a lot. If I look directly at it, I can't make out the individual stars, but if\
  \ I look a little off to the side, I can start to count that there are seven of\
  \ them. There's a lot of challenges in looking not directly at the thing that you\
  \ care the most about, which is its own kind of mental game that we probably won't\
  \ discuss in detail right now. Now that I've talked about some of these structural\
  \ aspects of the eye and the retina, I will try to be strategic about what I cover\
  \ next. We've been discussing the eye in terms of its passive optical properties,\
  \ such as how light bends and is absorbed, and the kind of photo receptors involved.\
  \ However, a lot of what we do with our eyes is shaped by that, specifically in\
  \ the context of eye movements. We move our eyes quite a lot; this is not unique\
  \ to humans. In fact, most animals move their eyes, although not every animal does.\
  \ Other primates of our general nature, I believe the family we belong to is called\
  \ Hominidae, not H, not family, whatever group. Our nervous system is very heavily\
  \ geared towards our vision, and our vision is designed to enable us to move our\
  \ eyes rapidly and precisely in order to focus the highly acute regions of our fovea\
  \ on things that we care about with great speed and spatial accuracy. Each of your\
  \ eyes has six muscles. For example, if this is my eye, there are two muscles on\
  \ the top and bottom that move the eye up and down, and two muscles on the sides\
  \ that move the eye left and right. Additionally, there are two other muscles at\
  \ the top and bottom that rotate the eye around its optical axis; these are known\
  \ as torsional eye movements. I will be able to demonstrate this to you when I'm\
  \ wearing an eye tracker, but this rotation happens all the time. If you do this\
  \ motion, your eyes are rotating in their optical axis, although not excessively.\
  \ These muscles, the one on the bottom comes in from below and the one on top passes\
  \ through a ligamentous sling. There is a ligament that loops around the superior\
  \ oblique muscle that attaches to the top of your eye and allows it to rotate. Much\
  \ of what we will observe when I put the eye tracker on is the eye bouncing around\
  \ on the screen. The majority of those eye movements are just stabilizing my head\
  \ against the motion of my head because we move our heads a lot. The opsin, which\
  \ is the part that absorbs light, operates relatively slowly\u2014not in terms of\
  \ photon absorption, but in how slowly it resets. There is a biochemical process\
  \ in your eye that occurs after the opsin absorbs a photon, which requires time\
  \ to reset before it can absorb light again, mediated by vitamin A or something\
  \ like that. You've seen this before: if you look at a bright light and then look\
  \ away, you can see an afterimage of that light in your vision because those opsins\
  \ have absorbed photons, and it takes time for them to reset. You can no longer\
  \ absorb light from that portion of your visual field because it's sort of been\
  \ maxed out. Because of that, you have to stabilize your eyeball in relation to\
  \ the world in order for it to have time to form an image from the light that is\
  \ making it through this complicated process to reach your retina. A lot of the\
  \ purpose of eye movements is to stabilize your eye in the world. This happens simultaneously\
  \ with another process of information gathering eye movements, where I can actually\
  \ move my eyes to specific places because I care about the information coming from\
  \ that portion of my visual field. We will have much more to say about that when\
  \ we look closely at eyeballs. It's very complicated and very fast. Your eyeballs\
  \ are the fastest and most precise motor structures in your body. When you are engaging\
  \ in fast, interesting behavior, such as walking across a rocky field or playing\
  \ sports or video games, which require very fast and precise visual information,\
  \ you are making eye movements at a rate of about one every 150 milliseconds, which\
  \ is the fastest they can go. That is roughly the minimum time it takes for the\
  \ neural architecture to extract information from that pipeline. Most of the time,\
  \ eye movements are not made nearly that fast, but they can go up to that speed.\
  \ This can happen while your body is jumping and running around, and as you run,\
  \ your head is bobbing around. There is a very complex machinery of stabilization\
  \ such that information gathering, known as saccades\u2014fast eye movements\u2014\
  happens on top of those stabilization mechanisms that allow your eye to be still\
  \ long enough to absorb the information necessary to form an image. A lot of the\
  \ field of visual neuroscience involves looking at illusions. and learning about\
  \ what the illusions say about our visual system. For example, when you were asking\
  \ about peripheral vision, that's happening at a different part of the eye, not\
  \ the cornea. There are similarly illusions that we can attribute to different parts\
  \ of the visual system. One of them, which you may have seen, is called a Hermann\
  \ grid. If you look at it, you'll probably see little ghostly black dots. When you\
  \ look at a dot, it's white, but the ones that you're not looking at will appear\
  \ to be a different color. Similarly, this is another classic illusion where all\
  \ the intersections are white. I promise you they are all white, but if you look\
  \ at them, you'll probably see little shadowy ghostly shapes in the corners of the\
  \ other dots. For a while, one generation of MacBook had this effect on the keyboard,\
  \ but I think they probably fixed that. This is basically caused by... Not why don't\
  \ we have these things? So, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,\
  \ ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen.\
  \ This one has the effect that you cannot\u2014 I don't know if it works with the\
  \ artifact there, but if you just Google \"Hermann grid 12 dots,\" like, this is\
  \ one of the things. It's hard to display these things on a screen because they\
  \ don't always work out. You can't see all of them at once because of the interactions\
  \ with your ganglion cells, which have to do with the ganglion retina cells. This\
  \ is a layer that I just can't quite get to. The ganglion cells have to do with\
  \ the pooling that happens, where it's kind of like this layer where the photoreceptors\
  \ from different areas get pulled together and respond as if they become one nerve\
  \ coming off the back of your retina. In the center of your visual field, in that\
  \ fovea region, it's almost a one-to-one mapping where almost every photoreceptor\
  \ has an axon coming down and going back through your optic nerve. But around the\
  \ periphery, the signals from multiple receptors get pulled together. A lot of these\
  \ effects happen because of the interactions in that region. If you're looking at\
  \ the dot in question, you see it correctly, but the periphery is doing pooling\
  \ over that region of the retinal field. So, the whiteness of this dot gets sort\
  \ of mixed in with the darkness of the surrounding regions, and your brain interprets\
  \ it as being a different color than it is. Then, when you move your eye towards\
  \ it, now it looks white. However, the thing you were looking at has this other\
  \ effect. Let's see if this side is still running. So, fovea shader toy. This is\
  \ one of my favorite versions of that fovea detector. So, if it's working for me\u2014\
  every one of these crosses is rotating the entire time, but if you're looking at\
  \ it, tell me if this is working from your perspective. Only the part that you're\
  \ looking at should have rotation, and the rest of them should look still. Is that\
  \ working? That's because of your phobia, and because your phobia is so much more\
  \ sensitive than the others. If you just Google \"phobia detector Shader toy,\"\
  \ you'll find this, and it looks better on your screen. It's one of these areas\
  \ where your ability to identify the motion is designed to be at your threshold.\
  \ The only portion of the screen where you can actually see the motion is at that\
  \ focal place. The effect is very strange; as you look around, it will look like\
  \ there is only a little patch of it that is rotating, and that patch will follow\
  \ wherever you choose to point your eyes. Someday, whoever is hosting this site\
  \ will stop hosting it, and that will be sad. Also, the first time I found this,\
  \ I couldn't interpret the code, but now I'm better at that. I know how to pull\
  \ this into my own life and have more control over it. \n\nThe point is that your\
  \ vision is complicated, and it's complicated before it even hits your brain. There\
  \ is a sort of interesting aspect when I mentioned peripheral versus central nervous\
  \ system; I intended to mention the retina as a kind of gray area. When talking\
  \ about central versus peripheral nervous system, you often discuss which part of\
  \ your eye is doing processing and which part is just funneling the information\
  \ either to or from the central nervous system. The retina is one of those cases\
  \ where it would be very hard to argue that what\u2019s happening in the middle\
  \ layers of the retina wouldn't count as processing. A lot of the effects I just\
  \ showed you, those illusions, happen before the light and the neural activity driven\
  \ by the light ever leave your eye. \n\nOh, another visual effect: just look up\
  \ your blind spot too. Just do me a favor and pretend like I did that in class.\
  \ Google \"Blind Spot demo\" and do the thing where you learn to find the blind\
  \ spot where your thumb disappears, and then just reflect on that. The eye is a\
  \ very complicated thing, and the eyeball itself has a lot going on. We will talk\
  \ more about this later. The primary visual cortex is typically where visual processing\
  \ occurs in the brain. A significant portion of our brain is devoted to vision,\
  \ and in the visual cortex area, roughly 50% is dedicated to processing the central\
  \ one degree of your phobia. Your phobia, by the way, is about the size of your\
  \ thumbnail at arm's length. Thus, about 50% of your photoreceptors and 50% of your\
  \ visual cortex are devoted to processing this small portion of your visual field.\
  \ Essentially, 50% of the architecture of your visual system is devoted to just\
  \ 1% of your visual field. This highlights how the ability to move our eyes precisely\
  \ enables us to guide our motor behavior effectively. That concludes the class.\

  text: 'Okay, hello, hello, hello, hi. All right, let''s do today. I guess spring
    break is next week, so that''s nice. I once again stand here before you as a liar
    and a generally untrustworthy person because I said I would have the stuff for
    this done by today. I don''t. You know, I hit some, it''s like, I once again made
    an assignment that requires technical capacity that did not exist at the time
    I made the assignment. So I''ll give you a quick update on that. I should have
    something done by Wednesday and then just push all the deadlines out. So things
    will kind of be spread out over the next couple of weeks and you should all be
    set up for it.


    The content of the lecture today is going to be about vision and eyeballs and
    sort of how that stuff generally works. We''ve covered it a little bit in the
    overview at the beginning of the semester, but now we will go a little more in
    depth. Some things that I probably hit pretty fast in passing, I''ll still hit
    pretty fast in passing but at a slightly slower rate. Then, next Wednesday, so
    tomorrow''s class, Wednesday class, I will bring in an eye tracker and we''ll
    do kind of an eye tracking demo, similar to the one I did with the motion capture
    but less involved because all the cameras in that process are attached to my head,
    so it''s a little bit easier to set up.


    Then we''ll have spring break, and we''ll go over that and the rest of the class.
    Let''s see how much time I want to do this. I think I will just give a quick update
    on my assignment for the course of making sense of all your wacky nonsense. So,
    very quickly, the main technical challenge here is that I want to do these exam
    chats, which I talked about last week, but a lot of you weren''t here, so I''ll
    say it again.'

  text: "The goal is to create some chat spaces on the server where the bot has been\
    \ designed with the content of the lecture I have been giving, recording, and\
    \ putting online. There are two forms of that chat set up. One is designed to\
    \ help you as you work through your chosen topic and try to connect the concepts\
    \ we've discussed, particularly from a philosophical perspective related to empirical\
    \ measurement and what is being recorded from the environment. The idea is to\
    \ connect those thoughts to your chosen topic. \n\nThe other version will be specifically\
    \ tuned to assist you in coming up with your second poster proposal, which is\
    \ essentially an outline or schematic form of your paper. This should state, \"\
    This is my paper; these are the methods\" and summarize the introduction, methods,\
    \ results, and discussion in two sentences or less. This outline will form the\
    \ content of the poster you are submitting. \n\nThe poster draft is due the week\
    \ after spring break. I will find time in class to review what you have and answer\
    \ questions. The draft is not the final version. The intention is that it is a\
    \ completed poster that you could print and present if necessary. However, we\
    \ will allow some time for revision so you can discuss it with your classmates\
    \ and improve it. This means if you have changes you want to make, you can do\
    \ that before the final submission. The final poster will need to be uploaded\
    \ and printed by March 25th, so it's important you feel ready for it, as once\
    \ it's printed, it is permanent.\n\nThe technical aspect involves condensing down\
    \ the lectures into a format that can fit into the prompt of an AI bot. For passive\
    \ education purposes, I will point out where that is happening in the course repository.\
    \ At this point, I think there are about six recorded lectures."

  text: "Each lecture lasts somewhere between an hour to an hour and a half, so that's\
    \ a lot of words from a human being. At this point in history and in my personal\
    \ development, it is relatively easy to pull the spoken content from a video on\
    \ YouTube into a text-based format. However, there are a couple of challenges.\
    \ For one thing, the number of words spoken in an hour and a half is significantly\
    \ higher than the actual meaningful content being expressed. Additionally, when\
    \ we speak aloud, we do not typically speak in grammatically correct sentences.\
    \ If you were to write down what I'm saying, it might sound like a person having\
    \ a stroke. We may feel like we are speaking in grammatical form, but we are not.\
    \ \n\nI have been writing some AI code, which is a bit sloppy by my own standards\
    \ but gets the job done. This code first processes the content by breaking it\
    \ down into ten-minute sections. Then it sends each section to an AI that cleans\

  text: What is generally called perceptual motor control, where the "O" in the middle
    means it's sort of perceptual motor, is the connection between the perceptual
    systems of the body and the motor systems of the body. These are two things that
    are often studied to great effect in isolation of each other. However, in natural
    behavior, they are not really separable in the same way. To move your body effectively
    in a complex and dynamic world requires you to have good perceptual information
    about that world. Knowing where things are is a very important component of planning
    your motions and your movements effectively. Vision is a very classic sense; not
    every animal uses vision entirely, and not every animal has vision as core to
    their nervous system as we do, but it is a very classic environmental energy to
    be tapped into. We are going to talk about the evolutionary elements of this at
    a later point in the semester. Essentially, this has been around for as long as
    there have been microbes or the ability to absorb photons from the world. Determining
    dark areas from bright areas is something even single-celled organisms do, such
    as rising to the top of a pool of water in the daytime and dropping down at night.
    So, let's take a quick trip through the main pathways of the perceptual system.
    Let's start with light itself. Light is covered by the study of light, which is
    generally under the field of optics. Optics is the part of physics that involves
    photons, refractions, lenses, and stuff like that. Historically, the origins of
    the study of optics as a specific field are generally attributed to Alhazen, who
    was in seventh-century modern Iraq. It wasn't called Iraq back then, but he was
    a scholar in the seventh to ninth century; I can't remember exactly when. He was
    the first person to start thinking about light specifically and to think about
    light in the context of how it functions.

  text: Light travels in straight lines and can be measured that way. The story goes
    that he created a pinhole camera. He was in his tent in the bright sun and noticed
    that if there was a pinhole in the otherwise opaque walls of the tent, he could
    see an image of the world projected onto the other side of the tent. This phenomenon
    is known as a camera obscura or pinhole camera. This was not the first time in
    history that this optical effect was discovered; the original reference to it
    appears in ancient Chinese texts. However, at that time, it was presented more
    as a documentation of a strange optical effect than an understanding of why it
    occurred or what was going on with it. There was less exploration into the underlying
    principles of the optics involved. Ibn al-Haytham, known for writing the Book
    of Optics, provided a lengthy treatise on the study of light and specifically
    how it interacts with the visual system. He included some very accurate anatomical
    models of the early visual system. These ideas were somewhat lost for about 500
    to 600 years until Descartes came along and translated much of this work. The
    main idea here was the discovery of light as an entity that exists independently
    in nature. While people had always known that light existed, it hadn't been studied
    precisely as a distinct natural entity. In addition to his anatomical work, Ibn
    al-Haytham mapped out the basic geometries of optical phenomena, including why
    images appear inverted in a pinhole camera, which relates to the way light travels.

    and bouncing off the top of the Minette travels down to that point, TR point,
    at the bottom, and then travels up to that point. That's how you get the kind
    of inverted image there. You'll see this image a lot, sort of like a projection
    in the eye. This is sort of classic textbook stuff where you're presenting the
    images sort of backward, like upside down on the retina, which is true, but I
    think it kind of misses some of the point. But that's fine. One of the interesting
    things, one of the reasons why this guy is sort of considered to be one of the
    scholars of history, is that he did a lot of that early work on optics, and he
    hit most of the major points pretty straight off the bat, particularly in the
    idea of projective geometry. Oh, it's this one I already have up. Oh yeah, B2
    projected. So like, this is the kind of epipolar geometry that is used behind
    that motion capture thing and through the 3D projection, all that kind of stuff.
    These are sort of representative images from modern software packages on how to
    do computer vision, and most of the math for this was kind of worked out way back
    then. The main thing that he didn't have, the main thing that he couldn't quite
    figure out, was refraction and the way that light can... He understood that light
    travels in straight lines, but he didn't really understand how lenses worked.
    So when you look at some of these images of the eye, come on, man. Anyways, a
    lot of the labels and stuff that happen in here are accurate to this day, except
    for one thing that he kind of had wacky going on. In the lens of the eye, he believed
    that there was a little demon that lived there and sort of bent the light to make
    it make sense. I'm not saying that he believed there were demons living in your
    eyes, but it was sort of like a placeholder. I think I've already said this in
    this class, but it was kind of like a placeholder for 'I'm not sure what's happening.'

    \ the quantum aspects of it, they show up here. When light bounces off of an object\

    I know what you're talking about, and it's important because astigmatism refers
    to a layer of optometry that I haven't delved into deeply. The context involves
    contact lenses that sit on top of the cornea; they have some kind of suction mechanism
    that slightly alters the shape of the cornea to help change its passive refractive
    properties. This effect lasts about a day, so you wear them overnight, and then
    when you wake up, the results are quite surprising. We've advanced past the old
    technology of hard contact lenses; in the past, contact lenses were hard glass
    objects. You have a question about larger or stronger lenses, correct? Yes, astigmatism
    is related to the shape of the overall eyeball, including the cornea itself. The
    shaping that occurs at the eye involves the corneal shape. You definitely need
    to take your contacts out for sanitation and hygiene purposes. However, regarding
    what you mentioned, I'm not sure if that's accurate. If an eye doctor is saying
    that, then maybe there's merit to it, but if not, I don't believe that is correct.

    developed a method for Adaptive Optics that compensates for atmospheric distortion.
    This involves shining a sodium laser into the atmosphere and adjusting the lens

    One area where stem cells are commonly used is in parts of the body that do not
    generally heal on their own, which typically includes non-vascular tissue such
    as cartilage and the meniscus found in the knees. Because there is no blood flow
    in these areas, they do not heal like tissues where blood circulation is present.
    For example, when you cut your arm, the healing process occurs because stem cells
    in your blood attach to the damaged tissue and facilitate the healing. However,
    tissues like cartilage do not have blood flow, which inhibits this type of natural
    healing.


    The eye does have vasculature, meaning it has some blood running through it, but
    not significantly in the clear parts. I wouldn''t be surprised to find research
    about repairing eye damage over time with the help of stem cells. However, as
    far as I know, there is nothing established in clinical practice. I would bet
    they are conducting experiments on rats. The eye, like many other parts of the
    body, can accumulate damage over time. This is why I tend to wear sunglasses outdoors
    during the day. Ultraviolet light and blue light can cause damage to the sensitive
    biological tissues in the eye. While the eye does have some ability to heal, particularly
    in the neural areas at the back, it does not heal indefinitely. The rate at which
    it heals may not keep pace with environmental damage.


    You can dismiss the idea that staring at bright lights for too long is inherently
    damaging. For example, while staring directly at a bright light is not advisable,
    I don''t believe that regular TV exposure is significantly harmful. This ties
    into the study of how we are exceptionally good at adapting to different light
    levels. If you look at your phone in the middle of the night, the screen appears
    overwhelmingly bright. Yet, in daylight, even on a cloudy day, you can barely
    see it due to the surrounding light. The screen remains the same brightness, but
    your perception changes significantly based on your environment and the lighting
    conditions around you.'

    this happens largely through passive means at the level of the cornea, while the\
    \ lens plays a more active and reflective role. Once light passes through these\

    \ parts of the eye respond to blue light differently than others, which are not\
    \ part of the main visual system. This is thought to be related to circadian rhythms.\n\

    \ \n\nThe first thing we'll talk about is the photoreceptors. Photoreceptors are\

  text: A photon bumps the electron into a higher orbital, which changes the ionic
    properties of the system. The general status of how many of the opsin in the rod
    or cone in question have absorbed their favorite wavelength of photon changes
    the electrochemical properties of the entire system. The connected structures
    notice that a particular rod is ramped up; it has absorbed a lot of its favorite
    kind of light. This is part of the cascade of neural activity that represents
    your perceptual experience. I think this varies by animal, but for us, our rods
    tend to be focused on green. Green is a good color to be sensitive to since it
    is abundant on Earth. The cones associated with color vision are typically represented
    as red, green, and blue. Generally, these correspond to short, medium, and long
    wavelengths of light, where blue is short wavelength, red is long wavelength,
    and green is in the middle. They all reside there and have a certain distribution.
    Another thing to note is that this is the back of the eye, and light comes in
    this way. You might expect that the part of the rods and cones most sensitive
    to light would face the light, but that is not how it is set up. In fact, the
    cones face away from the light, so light has to pass through several layers of
    cells first. After the photoreceptors, there are middle layers followed by ganglion
    cells. These cells are doing all sorts of complex processing. Textbook images
    often make the visual system seem cleaner than it is. Our vision system is backwards;
    it is the opposite of how you would expect it to be, and there are optical consequences
    because everything we see is imaged through a couple of layers of dense cells.

    a sort of red spike. This represents eccentricity, where zero is on the fovea,
    and then plus or minus however many degrees. You can see that roughly 50% of your
    photoreceptors are in that ventral one degree of your eye. If you were to look
    into the back of your retina and count all of the photoreceptors, you would find

    has been mitigated by pushing out the structures that obstruct it.


    Something else you might notice is the distribution of the cones versus the rods.
    The rods, shown in purple, pertain to your peripheral vision. Their distribution
    is spread out to the periphery, which is thought to be for several reasons. These
    rods respond to smaller amounts of light and tend to respond faster. When we think
    about peripheral vision, its job is not to provide us with precise levels of vision,

    dead of night looking at the stars, the best way to see something, when your eyes
    are very dark adapted, is not to look directly at it. In the middle of the night,
    your rods aren't really working very well, so if you look directly at something,
    you're going to be getting less light than you want. Astronomers learn that if
    you're interested in a particular star, the best way to see it is to look a little
    bit off to the side of it and let your rods do the work of providing the information
    from the incoming light. So next time you're out on a nice starry night, you can
    try that out. For example, the Seven Sisters, or Pleiades, is a cluster of stars
    where I've noticed this effect a lot. If I look directly at it, I can't make out

    about what I cover next. We've been discussing the eye in terms of its passive
    optical properties, such as how light bends and is absorbed, and the kind of photo
    receptors involved. However, a lot of what we do with our eyes is shaped by that,
