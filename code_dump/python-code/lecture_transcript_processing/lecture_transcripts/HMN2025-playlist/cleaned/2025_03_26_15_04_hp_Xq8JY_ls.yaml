full_transcript: "But, yeah, if you're interested, we can follow that. Other than\
  \ that, we're going to go ahead and get started. This is kind of like\u2014I wouldn't\
  \ necessarily call it a rite of passage; it's more of a shtick than anything else\u2014\
  but it's something that I recommend trying to cultivate in yourself if you find\
  \ interest, especially if you're planning on having anything resembling a career\
  \ or a lifetime studying humans, science, and biology. The idea is to have a sense\
  \ in your own mind of what the complete story is: where do you think things come\
  \ from? A big focus in this course is the empiricist game of trying to think about\
  \ how everything can be traced back to some kind of empirical measure. While I hope\
  \ to emphasize that those links are always somewhat fuzzy and murky at best, I think\
  \ one of the cornerstones of scientific thinking is the idea that you're not allowed\
  \ to believe things without some kind of reason for believing them. In your daily\
  \ life, you absolutely can think all sorts of things, and they don't have to be\
  \ particularly grounded. But in the scientific part of life, particularly in the\
  \ world of scientific communication and research, the idea is that everything has\
  \ to be grounded in some way. This particular slice of the large-scale cosmological\
  \ story of human existence is my attempt to cohere everything I know about those\
  \ stories into something resembling a coherent narrative. We're going to be touching\
  \ on topics in which I am very far from an expert\u2014expert enough to teach a\
  \ class like this, but one of the things that happens when you start becoming a\
  \ professional researcher is you realize the difference between being familiar with\
  \ a topic, being an expert in a topic, and being a true expert in a topic. These\
  \ are topics with which I am, at best, quite familiar, but good enough to get started.\
  \ So, first things first: the Big Bang. That's where, as far as we understand and\
  \ as far as we currently believe\u2014we, with a capital 'W,' meaning humans as\
  \ a whole\u2014that's where we believe things started. Or at least, that's the beginning\
  \ of the story that we can tell. The Big Bang is our current culturally preferred\
  \ creation myth, and like all good creation myths, it explains a lot of the data.\
  \ The data, as we can explain, but also like all creation myths that have come before,\
  \ really doesn't explain everything. It's not a fully coherent story. For example,\
  \ in ancient Japan, there was a myth that Japan was formed by a god who stuck a\
  \ sword into the water and pulled it out, and the droplets formed the islands. That's\
  \ a pretty good story to help you understand where to find more islands. If you\
  \ go east, you're not going to find any. If you go west, you find a big landmass.\
  \ If you go down southwest, you're going to find a big string of islands. So, it's\
  \ useful in that regard, but it\u2019s not particularly satisfying from a geological\
  \ perspective.\n\nSimilarly, a lot of the Western tradition is based off the cosmology\
  \ of the Bible, which we don't really tend to think about beyond the sort of 'let\
  \ there be light' aspect of it. If you go back and read just the first 150 words,\
  \ there\u2019s a reference. It's sort of based off a more ancient kind of Hebrew\
  \ cosmology where we\u2019re living in a bubble in a giant ocean, where there's\
  \ an infinite ocean and the stars form like a dome. We\u2019re like this crust of\
  \ Earth floating on an infinite ocean, and the fixed stars are the thing holding\
  \ it up. That was kind of enough to explain why there are such things as fixed stars,\
  \ which we know now are not fixed; they\u2019re just really far away. And there\
  \ are these other things called planets that zip around on the inside, which we\
  \ used to think were part of these spheres, one inside the other. \n\nAgain, these\
  \ are sort of stories that helped us to make sense of the scientific data that we\
  \ had. But I bet if you were to sit down with any of the scholars of the time and\
  \ really ask them how certain they were that this was the full story, I would hope\
  \ at least that they would give you an answer somewhat similar to what you would\
  \ get from a modern cosmologist who would say, 'Well, it\u2019s almost certainly\
  \ not true, that story that we tell.' And we know that it\u2019s not true because\
  \ everything we\u2019ve thought before has also been proven to be not true, and\
  \ everything that we continue to learn causes us to reshape that story. \n\nWith\
  \ things like the Big Bang, it explains why if you look out you see expansion in\
  \ all directions. If you sort of roll the clock back on something that\u2019s always\
  \ expanding in all directions, you eventually get to a place where it\u2019s in\
  \ a small compact space. And then, you can do all sorts of more specific, complex\
  \ global-scale scientific efforts, involving such things as radio telescopes on\
  \ the Earth, on the tops of mountains, and in low Earth orbit. I guess not so low\
  \ Earth orbit anymore. You can tell all sorts of stories that make sense, but in\
  \ the same way that the sword in the water doesn't really explain everything, there\
  \ is still much more to uncover. To know about Japan, the Big Bang also doesn't\
  \ explain everything there is to know about the Universe. There was just a popular\
  \ article about some recent modeling discovery. The data might make more sense if\
  \ we give up on the concept of the conservation of energy, and that might sort of\
  \ explain the data better, which would seem like a big tradeoff. But we've actually\
  \ given that up before when we started moving towards relativity. Well, that's not\
  \ really true; but anyways, the point is, if you want to tell a story that's grounded\
  \ in empirical research, it's typically going to start with something like the Big\
  \ Bang. The Big Bang was a massive explosion\u2014where, you know, despite the past\
  \ couple of weeks notwithstanding, all of the energy in the universe was made available\
  \ at that time. So, as far as I understand it, the story is that in those initial\
  \ moments of expansion, everything was there, including a bunch of antimatter and\
  \ a bunch of matter\u2014however you want to define those things. I'm not really\
  \ there. When put into contact with each other, they obliterate themselves and are\
  \ replaced with the equivalent, E=mc\xB2, of energy. That initial obliteration of\
  \ matter and antimatter is thought to be the source of all the energy. Most of that\
  \ explosion turned into light and heat and things like that. Chemistry wasn't a\
  \ thing yet; we'll get to that in a bit. In one of the perhaps oldest scientific\
  \ mysteries, whatever obliteration happened in those first picoseconds of the universe\
  \ was not symmetric. After all, the matter and antimatter obliterated themselves,\
  \ and there was some stuff left over, which is very convenient for us because that's\
  \ everything that we know and care about. Some of the oldest theories, not the oldest\
  \ because they are actually quite recent, involve the strange math of symmetry breaking\
  \ in physics, which tries to understand why there was something left over after\
  \ that initial obliteration. Emmy Noether is a name associated with this, and she\
  \ also has the historical interest of being a female physicist from way back when\
  \ that wasn't common. There are some strange stories of scientists you've heard\
  \ of, like Einstein, who tricked universities into hiring her. She did a bunch of\
  \ early math on symmetry, baking, and physics. Anyway, after those first picoseconds\
  \ of expansion, all the energy that we could ever care about, as far as we know,\
  \ is created. Then, for a period of time, which I'm actually not familiar with the\
  \ exact amount, that's all that there was\u2014a bunch of plasma and extremely hot\
  \ gas, which was too hot to do anything that we would think of as a gas. As that\
  \ expansion continued outward, the universe cooled off, as things tend to do, and\
  \ slowly but surely, the initial stuff of the universe started to coalesce. I think\
  \ the first things that formed, which we would recognize, were things like the quarks,\
  \ protons, and electrons, and then our very first good friends named hydrogen. Those\
  \ gases would slowly, or actually not that slowly, form what's called the periodic\
  \ table.\n\nIf you want to talk about the history of biology, you do have to start\
  \ with the Big Bang because the Big Bang explains why you have such a weird thing\
  \ as this. This is also a nice approximation of truth\u2014a very useful configuration\
  \ of letters that have a lot of meaning associated with them. As far as the story\
  \ we are telling, we've just reached here. Hydrogen forms at some point in the history\
  \ of the early universe; I should know that number\u2014maybe next year I will.\
  \ But slowly over time, those gases cool down, and you get such a strange thing\
  \ as a nebula. A nebula is just a big cloud of gas floating through space.\n\nNebulae\
  \ form because of gravity, which is something that pulls matter together. So, if\
  \ you have a bunch of random stuff floating through the universe and there's nothing\
  \ else going on, the heat makes things zip apart from each other while gravity makes\
  \ things pull towards each other. It turns out that's a pretty important distinction\
  \ for the rest of the time to come. As the universe starts to cool down, particles\
  \ begin to pull in on themselves, forming big clouds called nebulae. Eventually,\
  \ you get enough of these gases together. I say gases, but really, there is only\
  \ one gas at this point\u2014hydrogen. There might be\u2014I don't even think there's\
  \ helium yet. I think it's just hydrogen. And it gets to a point where there's enough\
  \ of it that the gas pulls in on itself even more. The gravity wants to crush everything\
  \ down into the smallest space possible until eventually, the gas gets so... As\
  \ it gets squished down, it rubs against itself and gets hotter. Although it's not\
  \ exactly friction, the compression from gravity causes another very important event\
  \ in the history of our universe: the ignition of the first stars. Now, it is truly\
  \ an ignition. I'm going to speed up here because it's important to get to the parts\
  \ of this that actually have neurons and stuff to make it relevant to the course,\
  \ but I promise it's at least a little bit relevant. So, basically, you have the\
  \ big clouds that slowly condense down until they become spheroids. As gravity pushes\
  \ in, the gases get hotter until eventually, some strange quantum effect happens.\
  \ It's not exactly like a combustion engine in your car; it's more like a quantum\
  \ superposition thing, I guess. But eventually, it gets squished together enough\
  \ that you get a very strange effect called fusion. Fusion is what happens when\
  \ you take something that looks like one proton and one electron and you get them\
  \ close enough together that some strange event occurs, and they become something\
  \ like helium. Once that process happens, fusion is an extremely exothermic reaction,\
  \ meaning a massive amount of energy is released when these hydrogen atoms form\
  \ into helium. So now, the collapsing force of gravity is pushed back against by\
  \ the exploding force of fusion, resulting in a stable star that is happily burning\
  \ hydrogen into helium. Good job for that star! Now, that lasts for a good little\
  \ while. So basically, right now, this star\u2014which if I knew more about stars,\
  \ I would know the type of\u2014well, I don't, so let's not worry about it. This\
  \ star is now burning its fuel, which is hydrogen, and the output of that fuel burning\
  \ is helium. Everything is going well until eventually, the star runs out of gas,\
  \ and it no longer has more hydrogen, leaving only helium. The force of compression\
  \ is not\u2026 ...enough to fuse helium into beryllium and beyond. Some of those\
  \ details about the elements will come out shortly, but this is good enough for\
  \ our conversation. Eventually, when all the helium is gone and the fusion force\
  \ is no longer counteracting the force of gravity, the star begins to collapse again.\
  \ As it collapses, it becomes denser and hotter until eventually, you have enough\
  \ force\u2014enough energy\u2014to start fusing helium into beryllium and lithium.\
  \ With this process, you begin forming heavier elements. That's math, that's chemistry,\
  \ that's cosmology. There are probably many other details involved; I\u2019m sure\
  \ you all are learning about those in your classes right now. So we burn through\
  \ our hydrogen, and we start burning our helium. This process, like the previous\
  \ one, is also fusion and is extremely exothermic, but it is less efficient than\
  \ the fusion of hydrogen. Helium plus helium equals beryllium, which produces less\
  \ energy than hydrogen plus hydrogen equals helium. But that's okay because we are\
  \ now in a new phase of the star\u2019s life. We\u2019re burning hydrogen and making\
  \ beryllium, and this process lasts quite a long time until eventually, we start\
  \ running out of helium. You get that same sort of process revisited; it probably\
  \ overlaps\u2014it\u2019s not a clear-cut sequence. Eventually, the star tries to\
  \ collapse again, and then it gets hot enough to start fusing beryllium into other,\
  \ more complex elements that come about. This process works efficiently for a long\
  \ time where the best reaction is still hydrogen to helium, but as you begin losing\
  \ that fuel, the star collapses and heats up until it can fuse different elements\
  \ into heavier ones. This process continues all the way up to and including iron,\
  \ which is a very useful element in daily life. Iron marks a significant point in\
  \ the progression of chemical complexity because the process of fusion\u2014which\
  \ I\u2019m not entirely sure about, whether it\u2019s the direct fusion of hydrogen\
  \ or subsequent reactions\u2014is not sufficient to counteract the crushing force\
  \ of gravity. When that happens, the star begins to collapse further down.   As\
  \ it's going, basically every time it burns through one of these elements, the time\
  \ it takes to start burning the other one and run out gets smaller and smaller.\
  \ By the time you get to iron, the collapsing doesn't even take long. It takes longer\
  \ to do it and also has diminishing returns; you get less bang for your buck, I\
  \ suppose. Until eventually, once you get past iron, that explosion no longer stops\
  \ the clock. It's no longer enough to keep the star coherent. You get this process\
  \ where the star starts to collapse in on itself, chunk by chunk, piece by piece.\
  \ Every time the outer core collapses, it hits the inner core, creating another\
  \ pressure spike. That pressure spike is where you get most of these other heavier\
  \ elements, until you start getting into some kind of elements that may only exist\
  \ in labs towards the bottom. Once all of that depends on the size of the star and\
  \ the makeup of the star, this process of burning through the different chemicals\
  \ and then this final process of collapsing eventually results in an explosion,\
  \ which is what we tend to call a supernova. That supernova is when all these weird,\
  \ extra fancy, strange, relatively rare chemicals get spewed out into the universe.\
  \ Everything we know and care about, all the weird chemistry that does all the cool\
  \ stuff, comes from this type of process. The strange thing about this, which I\
  \ find really, I mean, aside from all of it, really kind of troubling, is that a\
  \ lot of the things you talk about when discussing space involve time frames on\
  \ the order of millions of years and tens of millions of years. The process of burning\
  \ down from hydrogen to helium could take millions to tens of millions of years.\
  \ However, this process after iron, of slamming down and exploding outwards, happens\
  \ in just two weeks. A star-scale explosion, big enough to rip our entire solar\
  \ system apart, can occur within that time frame, like between now and the end of\
  \ the poster presentation. That's a little troubling but very useful for biology\
  \ because this is where all the good stuff comes from. Now, there are a couple of\
  \ things to note here when we're talking about the chemistry. In terms of you and\
  \ me, most of the stuff that we're made of and that we care about tends to exist\
  \ pretty, pretty... Pretty low on that list. So when we think of hydrogen, you've\
  \ got your carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. These are really our best friends. The\
  \ fact that they are above this line means that there is a ton of this stuff in\
  \ the universe, in particular, a good friend, oxygen, and our good friend, hydrogen.\
  \ Carbon is also hanging out all over the place. Because of the prevalence of hydrogen\
  \ and oxygen everywhere, that also means you get tons and tons of water. There is\
  \ lots and lots of water in the universe just floating around. There are many stellar\
  \ processes whose output is just water ice being flung out into the universe. We\
  \ read about one star that they were observing, and they thought that it was emitting\
  \ trillions of times the amount of water on the surface of the Earth every second\
  \ for millions of years. There is no shortage of water in the universe, and all\
  \ these other elements that hang around it, like carbons and nitrogens, are similarly\
  \ prevalent. So, that's useful. Another useful element is silica, or silicon. This\
  \ is where you get rocks. You can get rocks from all sorts of places, but silicon\
  \ and silicates make up rocky stuff, which is again very useful for humans.\n\n\
  As this sort of strange chemistry is going on, I believe that the timescale of the\
  \ universe is about 12 billion years. I think that's the number we tend to say.\
  \ I don't really know what those numbers mean, as that's one of those figures that\
  \ changes from time to time. On that scale, most of the time of the universe has\
  \ been spent just doing this and getting to the point where we're burning through\
  \ all these elements. In terms of percentage, most of the universe has been spent\
  \ doing this stuff. Where are we at? Yeah, so in terms of our list of things, we've\
  \ gone from the Big Bang to nebulae, to stars. Then the stars start exploding, and\
  \ that's where you get the weird chemistry. The weird chemistry is where you start\
  \ getting things like planets. That same sort of process of accretion, where nebulae\
  \ turn into stars, and then the stars start to explode and spill their guts out,\
  \ leads to other types of dust, and that other type of dust can form. other types\
  \ of spheroids, some of which we like to refer to as planets. The definition of\
  \ a planet is a complicated thing. It's not that complicated, actually. I just don't\
  \ want to talk about it. For our purposes, we can just think of it as any rocky\
  \ spheroid that orbits a star. Of course, the most useful planet for humans is Earth.\
  \ Earth appeared at some point in the past and started as a disc of dust around\
  \ a small, medium-sized yellow star named Sol. It wasn't named that before we named\
  \ it, but we did name it, and it's named Sol. Slowly, over time, over millions and\
  \ billions of years, that dust accreted into a rocky ball which was, at the start\
  \ of its life, very hot\u2014hot like liquid magma on the surface of the Earth.\
  \ It was a bad time for complex chemistry, actually a great time for complex chemistry,\
  \ but a bad time for delicate chemistry, which is what we are made of. Therefore,\
  \ for the majority of the lifetime of the planet Earth, it was an uninhabitable\
  \ lava world with acid rain and solar radiation. It was a bad time for biology.\
  \ However, as stated before, there\u2019s lots and lots of water in the universe.\
  \ Of the trillions of tons of dust that accreted into the planet Earth, a good percentage\
  \ of that was water ice. Slowly, over time, that magma ball of dirt we call Earth\
  \ cooled down to the point that some of that water was able to stay on the surface\
  \ of the planet and not evaporate off into space, marking the start of the oceans.\
  \ Oceans are very useful for the evolution of life because the universe is a rough\
  \ place. It's mostly empty, but the places that aren't empty are pretty rough. So,\
  \ if you want to have a process that would allow you to develop complex, delicate\
  \ biochemical processes, there has to be a way for those processes to be protected\
  \ from the harsh universe at large. In every example of the evolution of life that\
  \ we have available to us, evolution began at the bottom of a ... Warm liquid water\
  \ oceans are particularly useful for the evolution of life, at least in one example,\
  \ and probably in others as well. If we consider where the largest warm liquid water\
  \ ocean in the solar system is, you might think of the Pacific Ocean, but that would\
  \ be incorrect. The answer is Europa, or possibly Enceladus; I'm not sure which\
  \ one. Both are moons of Saturn. They are ice planets, so from the outside, they\
  \ appear to have a shield of ice. However, they have geothermal activity, meaning\
  \ their cores are warm. Between the core of ice and the rocky interior, there is\
  \ a warm liquid water ocean that we have never seen. We have flown spacecraft through\
  \ the geysers that erupt from these moons, and when we analyze the dust thrown up\
  \ by these geysers, we find that it contains methane. I'm not claiming that life\
  \ exists down there, but I would like to investigate. Now we are on a planet and,\
  \ as far as I know, we no longer need beryllium. I think we use beryllium to make\
  \ the lenses for thermal cameras because it can bend the wavelengths of light necessary\
  \ for that purpose, but I do not need it in my day-to-day life. Here we are at the\
  \ bottom of the ocean, where we start to develop our great, great grandparents,\
  \ which are essentially a kind of primordial goo that serves as our origin. Somewhere\
  \ in the process occurring at the bottom of that primordial ocean, strange linkages\
  \ of common molecules begin to form: your carbons, hydrogens, oxygens, and other\
  \ constituents. This story evolves regularly, and I haven't checked in on it in\
  \ some time, but my understanding is that we believe the origin of life began with\
  \ something that resembles RNA, which is a self-replicating molecule. The self-replicating\
  \ characteristic is crucial because once one of these molecules exists, it can create\
  \ infinite copies of itself. If a molecule can replicate itself, it has the materials\
  \ for replication and the opportunity to engage in that process. Now we've started\
  \ what we might call... Biological evolution involves various processes, one of\
  \ which is RNA functioning in its environment until a certain chemical event occurs.\
  \ If I were a different type of biology professor, I would have more detailed knowledge\
  \ about how RNA somehow becomes DNA. The DNA then starts to establish its own environment.\
  \ If we could trace back through the timeline, we might say that the origin of life\
  \ on Earth resembles a primitive organism, which we will refer to as having both\
  \ an inside and an outside. The inside of this entity contains everything it identifies\
  \ as itself\u2014though it does not possess a gender in the traditional sense. The\
  \ outside encompasses everything else. Therefore, we now have a distinction between\
  \ the inside and the outside. If this organism could speak English, it might say,\
  \ \u201CI am this, and everything else is that.\u201D These organisms continue to\
  \ thrive until another organism decides to consume one of them. Thus, they navigate\
  \ this primordial environment, with some eventually merging in a manner that allows\
  \ one to digest another without it dying. Instead, the entity on the inside maintains\
  \ its existence, asserting, \u201CI am here, and you are there.\u201D It provides\
  \ essential nutrients that the other organism requires for survival. As long as\
  \ they can coexist, both are content. This interaction leads to the formation of\
  \ eukaryotes, which are complex cells that evolve through mutual relationships.\
  \ This mutualism continues for a significant period until the numerous unicellular\
  \ organisms decide that they should cooperate and form structures we could recognize\
  \ as multicellular life. From what I understand, the first forms of multicellular\
  \ life are akin to tube worms and sponges, particularly in the deep ocean where\
  \ activity occurs at geothermal vents. This is where unique chemistry from the planet\u2019\
  s interior is released into the warm, liquid ocean, offering protection against\
  \ harmful radiation and meteorite impacts from the outer world. All this unusual\
  \ chemistry contributes to the development of life as we know it. We can get the\
  \ weird precursors we need to create mRNA, DNA, and the little prokaryotes, and\
  \ eventually form little spires. We just live our happy lives for quite some time\
  \ as tube worms at some geothermal vent at the bottom of an ocean somewhere on planet\
  \ Earth. Again, we are kind of going to be\u2014if you check my work, I'm sure you'll\
  \ find some places where the story doesn't quite line up with what I'm saying. But\
  \ in the manner of cartoons, I have done my own due diligence. If you look up the\
  \ details and get those extra layers of specificity, you would understand why this\
  \ cartoon is the one I showed you and not some other cartoon. You would say, \"\
  Oh, he was missing some of the details; he must not have realized this new research\
  \ or this subtle factor.\" But tube worms on geothermal vents under the water is\
  \ our current best guess of what's going on. Now, at some point in this process,\
  \ one of these organisms has a terrible idea: I think it's time to leave the geothermal\
  \ vent and move around the world. If I'm going to do that, I'm probably going to\
  \ need something resembling a nervous system. So, in the sort of Aesop's fable,\
  \ just-so story version of the evolution of life, one of these tube worms pops off\
  \ and becomes a regular worm. There's a lot of stuff I'm skipping here, but this\
  \ regular worm is also part of different branches of the Tree of Life, where things\
  \ went off in different directions, and some of these organisms became corals and\
  \ other forms. However, the ones that we personally care about, the ones we have\
  \ a personal affiliation for, are the wriggly worms. The wriggly worms had a very\
  \ good invention, a really great idea\u2014I think one of the best ideas in the\
  \ history of life. If you're a tube, you're pretty much just a mouth, so if you're\
  \ just a mouth, then that's a single-purpose entry-exit point. You have an inside\
  \ and an outside, and that's about it. Worms came along and said, \"I have a great\
  \ idea! Let's have that tube go all the way through and separate our concerns. We'll\
  \ call this the mouth, and we'll have another opening for the exit, which we can\
  \ name later.\" Now we have the good old worm. When you are in other classes, they\
  \ talk about C. elegans and similar organisms; those are the kinds of guys we're\
  \ referring to. They have neurons, and we have reached a point of enough specialization\
  \ for neurons, and they have something we would call a nervous system. Neurons are\
  \ sort of connected to each other, but there is nothing here that we would call\
  \ a central nervous system. We don't have spines yet; we don't have limbs yet. We\
  \ just have something that is capable of sensing the world and then performing actions\
  \ based on that information. The first, arguably, is likely chemo-sensation. That's\
  \ the sense sensation in detection of chemical gradients in the environment. We\
  \ would refer to that as smell or taste. If you walk into a room and you smell something,\
  \ you're picking up on a chemical gradient that is different enough from your regular\
  \ environment that you notice, \"Oh, there's a smell. It's coming from over there.\
  \ I wonder what it is.\" It's probably some weird biology because that makes volatile\
  \ organic compounds. These little wiggling worms, honestly, have this sensation\
  \ happening at the single-cell part of this story; they wiggle towards chemical\
  \ gradients because that's how they find food. Also, I think this was part of the\
  \ UK carot thing. Somewhere in this process, you have the very first beginnings\
  \ of the evolution of vision. Some organisms develop light-sensitive patches on\
  \ themselves, and those light-sensitive patches, coupled with some kind of motor\
  \ system\u2014which in the water doesn't have to be very much; it could just be\
  \ a buoyancy bladder\u2014allow them to float upwards when the sun is out and then\
  \ sink downwards when night comes. They can float towards the surface of the water\
  \ when the sun is out to do photosynthesis or whatever they're up to, and then they\
  \ can sink down into the depths at night to avoid predators. Actually, I don't even\
  \ think we had really predators at that point, but light-sensitive patches on single-celled\
  \ organisms are the origin of the weird chemistry I've talked about before. All\
  \ the opsins and those weird photochemicals in the back of your eye owe themselves\
  \ to the weird chemistry that developed among these organisms. Yes, so here we are\
  \ now. We have some pretty good stuff: we've got cells, we've got neurons, we've\
  \ got light sensitivity, we've got some kind of motor system, and we've got a world\
  \ which is increasingly less magma or lava, whichever one is on the surface. Remember,\
  \ lava versus magma: it's like one is on the surface and the other is below the\
  \ surface. Lava is on the surface. Our world is becoming increasingly less lava\
  \ and increasingly more ocean. Everything's pretty great. This persists for probably,\
  \ you know, we're still in kind of the B territory, so we're in billions of years\
  \ of just kind of wiggling around as weird goop and worms and tubes and sponges\
  \ and stuff like that. At some point\u2014this is another one that I really wish\
  \ I had written the number down here\u2014a strange event happens. We\u2019re evolving\
  \ things like shells and structures for our bodies under the water. In the fossil\
  \ record, there's a very clear moment where all of a sudden there\u2019s life everywhere,\
  \ and it gets real weird. That moment is called the Cambrian explosion. Cambrian\
  \ is like when you're looking through cuts of rock; the farther down you go, the\
  \ farther back in time you are. At some point in this, you just start seeing fossils\
  \ everywhere, and you get this strange type of rock called fossiliferous limestone.\
  \ When I was at UT, the University of Texas at Austin, Texas used to be the bottom\
  \ of an ocean, and they have buildings made out of this fossiliferous limestone\u2014\
  just big buildings and walls that are nothing but thick fossils of things like bivalves\
  \ and shells and strange things like that. It is thought that the reason for this\
  \ big explosion of biological density and diversity was the creation of what, if\
  \ the invention of the separation of concerns of the tube is the best invention,\
  \ probably the worst invention is the creation of predation. Because before this\
  \ time, I think there were still organisms going around eating each other; that's\
  \ just kind of a thing that would happen. But at some point, you start to see the\
  \ beginning of the predator-prey arms race where the predators realize that they\
  \ can actually, instead of spending all their time trying to do photosynthesis and\
  \ all that kind of stuff, just learn how to eat the things that can generate their\
  \ own energy. So they start specializing in all the tools they need to eat other\
  \ animals, and the other animals become prey. They say, 'Well, I'm going to have\
  \ to develop defenses against those predators.' I can go around making my own energy,\
  \ and this kind of, again, in the just-so story of the cartoon version of the history\
  \ of the world that I'm telling you, this sort of predator-prey dynamic starts to\
  \ really drive the evolutionary process into overdrive. It is thought that the explosion\
  \ of biodiversity that happened in the Cambrian explosion coincides with the original\
  \ development of that predator-prey dynamic in the animal kingdom. Somewhere around\
  \ this time, this progresses for a while. I believe at this point we are still kind\
  \ of thinking mostly in terms of bivalves and gastropods and maybe some sort of\
  \ worm-like objects. Some of those worm-like objects branch off at roughly this\
  \ time and become cephalopods. Eventually, cephalopods are things like cuttlefish\
  \ and octopuses and stuff like that\u2014very intelligent animals that are very\
  \ distantly related to us. They still have things like opsins in their retina, but\
  \ they don't have a lot of the other features that every other animal with intelligence\
  \ possesses. We have another animal that we can look at that has evolved intelligent\
  \ life, and it does share our lineage at some point, but we have to go really far\
  \ back to find it. That's one of the reasons why I have this deep abiding love of\
  \ cephalopod neuroscience, because they are the closest thing we are likely to get\
  \ to studying an alien intelligence on planet Earth. This is also around the time,\
  \ somewhat after this point\u2014I don't know exactly when\u2014where you start\
  \ to get a bunch of really weird animals floating around in the water. There are\
  \ many unusual ones; you can look them up. They have peculiar antennae, and there's\
  \ one with a buzz saw for a mouth, just strange animals swimming around, most of\
  \ which didn't survive to the modern day. A notable exception being horseshoe crabs;\
  \ they are from this point in time or sort of around that time. In that time, you\
  \ also start to see the creation of other useful things for humans, like bones and\
  \ muscles, which begin to show up in the lineage. The first skeleton of note is\
  \ the bony... Fishes are the bony fish. Actually, before these, there are the jawless\
  \ fish. The jawless fish are believed to be the first vertebrates. Our closest modern\
  \ relatives among jawless fish are lampreys. Lampreys look quite unusual but are\
  \ considered the earliest vertebrate or chordate animals. They share a somewhat\
  \ similar appearance with leeches, which are invertebrates, but lampreys have a\
  \ distinct sucker-like look. This topic is getting a bit beyond my depth of details,\
  \ but if I had to guess, they both emerged around similar times. However, leeches\
  \ evolved later as bloodsuckers or parasites, which means they probably appeared\
  \ after there were other animals to feed on. Lampreys have a spinal cord running\
  \ down their bodies, but I am unsure if they possess bones or are cartilaginous\
  \ like sharks. Lampreys are important; they often appear in neuroscience conferences,\
  \ such as the Society for Neuroscience. Their significance lies in the fact that\
  \ they represent the oldest and phylogenetically most ancient chordates, which connects\
  \ to the evolution of vertebrates. So, after the jawless fish, we have the bony\
  \ fish, which possess skulls and spinal columns. Things like eyeballs emerged around\
  \ 450 million years ago, which is quite some time. Whether or not this is the first\
  \ of this type of organism or just the first one that left behind a substantial\
  \ number of fossils is unclear. However, these are indeed the oldest eyeballs we\
  \ know about that we would consider similar to our own. Many organisms, like clams\
  \ and mussels, have eyestalks; they possess photosensitive chemicals and small optical\
  \ objects. But these particular creatures have proper eyeballs. In this paper, which\
  \ is one of my favorites, Mike Land discusses evidence suggesting that even at this\
  \ level of evolution, 450 million years ago, these creatures probably had eye movement\
  \ patterns similar to our own. They appear to have eye muscles and the machinery\
  \ necessary for something akin to the vestibulo-ocular reflex, which I've emphasized\
  \ a lot. This reflex enables your eyes to counter-rotate when you move your head.\
  \ I talked about how ancient it is, and how you cannot lose the vestibulo-ocular\
  \ reflex without also being dead; it's at least this ancient. In the simplified\
  \ version of the story, the reasoning is the same for why organisms need such mechanisms.\
  \ Options are slow; they take a while to respond to light. Therefore, if they are\
  \ going to form an image, they must have a stabilization mechanism. Given that opsins\
  \ have existed for billions of years, their chemistry comes from the primordial\
  \ era. Once you reach the point where animals can form detailed images of the world,\
  \ it is necessary to couple the vision process with a stabilization mechanism for\
  \ gaze relative to the world. This paper goes through and examines various animals,\
  \ arguing that all forms of vision, any animal with good vision, exhibit this saccade\
  \ and fixation strategy with some form of gaze stabilization similar to the vestibulo-ocular\
  \ reflex. Is this a goldfish? You have a Gaye head, and then this is the result.\
  \ These patterns may look familiar if you're looking at the squiggly lines I pulled\
  \ up the other week. This one is a rabbit, which is, I guess, not as exciting, but\
  \ evolutionarily, this is... who was this guy? Oh, uh, deos, Deo Cel, deos Crane\
  \ and a pigeon, talking about that kind of head bob motion as a gaze stabilization\
  \ mechanism. This is a chameleon; this is a rock crab. Now we're getting into that\
  \ sort of evolutionary depth. This is a stalk-eyed fly, and so all these guys are\
  \ exhibiting that same kind of pattern of sad and fixate, with some kind of gaze\
  \ stabilization mechanism. Now, we kind of jumped ahead in terms of the evolution\
  \ here, the evolutionary story there, but just pointing out that we're starting\
  \ to get into stuff that we have now touched on in this course in that topic area.\
  \ Now, okay, we're actually not going to accelerate because we're going to jump\
  \ ahead, but in terms of the time that has passed, the time is really going to start\
  \ to condense here. Everything I've said before this... this is probably 450 million\
  \ years ago. That means everything before this is 11 and a half billion years, and\
  \ everything after that is half a billion years. Even as I jump forward by hundreds\
  \ of millions of years, we're still zooming in very, very narrowly on just the barest\
  \ crust of history that we are actually a part of. At some point after these fish,\
  \ we start to get another good addition. Well, I guess, yeah, so at some point they,\
  \ you know, crawl out onto the land, then they start getting their little hands\
  \ and we sort of... hands and feet. We develop this particular pattern of tetrapod\
  \ morphology, which is the general shape of the head, upper limb, and lower limbs\
  \ that has become quite popular of late. That's where you get the fish crawling\
  \ out, you know, because at this point, everybody's still living in the water. Plants\
  \ have made it onto the land, but no animals have. So fish start crawling out of\
  \ the water to lay their eggs because it's... Safe, and then they sort of get more\
  \ accustomed to it. You get these transitional, like lungfish-style organisms that\
  \ sort of hang out on the borders. Eventually, some of them crawl farther out, and\
  \ you get the, uh, sort of reptilian types. Then those turn into the bird types,\
  \ and then those turn into the mammal types. Um, and that\u2019s when we're going\
  \ to sort of focus; that's the focus of our current conversation. Um, and there\
  \ is this very famous animation, um, Sean\u2019s Cosmos Evolution GIF. This whole\
  \ story that I\u2019ve been talking about, sort of the evolution and this whole\
  \ history, is kind of a play on the Sean version of this, which he calls the cosmic\
  \ calendar, where he goes through, okay, imagine that the history of the universe\
  \ is this 365-day calendar. Where were we at these different points of the calendar?\
  \ If I, maybe in the future, I\u2019ll remember those dates and use that same stick.\
  \ Um, but this is from the show Cosmos, which was just a great show that I think\
  \ is still worth watching. Can you play? No? Are you going to do it? Oh, you\u2019\
  re not the actual thing. Ah. And so, this is the sort of the short-form story of\
  \ evolution. Going to show the thing. Yeah, so this is from how you get the lipid\
  \ bilayer, you get the prokaryotes, multicellular organisms, you get the sort of\
  \ rock pools, you get these little geothermal vents, and they break off and become\
  \ weird worms. They become weird fish, they develop limbs, they get bones, they\
  \ start coming out on land; the reptiles become the ancestors of dinosaurs. Um,\
  \ and then they evolve into these mammals. These mammals were basically tree shrews;\
  \ they were the first mammals. They were, uh, they were small, kind of hiding in\
  \ the bushes type of thing, hanging out in the same era as the dinosaurs. Then,\
  \ when the cataclysm that killed the dinosaurs occurred, it became a bad time to\
  \ be a megafauna that requires tons and tons of food to survive. It became a very\
  \ good time to be a... Microf, particularly one that was endothermic, is a really\
  \ useful tool for warming our own blood. We're going to come back to these guys,\
  \ and they become these tree shrews. Our particular lineage of mammals is related\
  \ to the tree part. I guess the first ones were more like possums; they were the\
  \ original mammals, but I could be wrong. We specifically emerged from tree shrews\
  \ that were sort of living in the trees. They were arboreal creatures, so they lived\
  \ in trees. Because they were arboreal, they walked around on branches, and their\
  \ main appendages had to be grabby. This started to develop a very tight coupling\
  \ between the perceptual system and the motor system early in this era of evolution.\
  \ As we were like squirrels, running around on branches and grabbing and moving,\
  \ it makes sense that we currently have such a tight coupling between our perceptual\
  \ and upper limb appendage system. Our local motor system required this very close\
  \ perceptual-motor loop. Then we get to some more of this information, which we\
  \ will discuss in detail. At this point, it is noted that given 12 billion years\
  \ of evolution, if you leave hydrogen alone for long enough, it builds radio telescopes\
  \ and develops existential anxiety. So congratulations, we have made it to Earth;\
  \ we have made it to us, roughly speaking. We have gone through that early stuff:\
  \ the goop phase, bones and spines, evolution of predation, tetrapod mammals, the\
  \ grabby grabby tree shrew era of life, and then various types of monkeys and apes.\
  \ I won't belabor the point on that. But we get to... so around, let's see, I think\
  \ this is the one I want. This is not the picture. Oh, this one. So, this is the\
  \ head of the game here. In terms of the lineage of extant primates, there are basically\
  \ a bunch of them. There are monkeys: old world monkeys and new world monkeys. It's\
  \ another little piece of colonialism for your scientific nomenclature. Old world\
  \ monkeys are the ones that live in Africa, while new world monkeys tend to live\
  \ in South America. So, old world monkeys include things like baboons, and new world\
  \ monkeys include ones like capuchins. Then, the apes split off from the old world\
  \ monkeys. Our current cousins are the great apes, of which there are us, chimpanzees,\
  \ bonobos, gorillas, orangutans, and gibbons. I think that\u2019s it. \n\nI do need\
  \ to say this because it's important to me to share. There's a big evolutionary\
  \ question about which of the extant apes are the most similar to us. We all think\
  \ it's chimpanzees, but there are also bonobos. We are equally genetically related\
  \ to both of those, and it's part of the question of human evolution: Are we more\
  \ horrifically violent in our nature, or are we more caring and cooperative? The\
  \ answer is that this is not a well-formed question because humans are too complex\
  \ to have that simple story. But the comparison of us to other great apes is always\
  \ an interesting comparison. Generally, chimpanzees are quite violent; they are\
  \ not as violent as they\u2019re often portrayed, but they're really pretty violent\
  \ and can be quite scary. They handle things in a very aggressive way. \n\nIf I\
  \ had more time, I would talk about Jane Goodall, who is perhaps my favorite scientist.\
  \ But we're not going to get there. I have to read this one quote from Lovejoy that\
  \ discusses Ardipithecus ramidus. Ardipithecus ramidus is the oldest ancestor that\
  \ we share with the other apes. It was a grounded ape, so it lived. On it, lived\
  \ on the ground. Instead of being an arboreal animal, it was a ground animal. I'm\
  \ not going to find this right now; I will probably wind up spilling over into the\
  \ next class to get some of the details here because we're running out of time,\
  \ and there's more to say about the actual human part of this. There's this great\
  \ paper about Ardipithecus ramidus that was discovered relatively recently. I need\
  \ to find the PDF so I can recognize the content because it raises questions about\
  \ the evolution of bipedalism and humanity, and what life was like for these early\
  \ creatures, as well as what that says about us. One of the big questions that often\
  \ comes up is what drove our evolution. There it is. So, what was the driving force\
  \ of our evolution? One of the significant questions is male-male antagonism as\
  \ a driving force of evolution versus larger-scale cooperation. This might be my\
  \ favorite paragraph in a paper, which I will read in its entirety: A frequent explanation\
  \ of the canine reduction in bipedalism, which refers to the large, sharp canine\
  \ teeth, is that handheld weapons replace the need for strong bite force. However,\
  \ if male-male agonism had been fundamental to early hominid fitness, what selective\
  \ agency would have reduced its signature characteristics? How does it affect additional\
  \ human attributes? The absence of sperm competition in gorillas and orangutans\
  \ is accompanied by a\u2026 Dramatically reduced testes size and the elimination\
  \ of a free scrotum mean that their testes are more judiciously sequestered in a\
  \ post-penile budge. In contrast, not only are human scrota more pendulous than\
  \ even those of chimpanzees, but bipedality makes them extraordinarily vulnerable\
  \ during upright combat. It seems illogical to attribute habitual uprightness to\
  \ an evolutionary trait that would demand even greater selection for testes sequestration\
  \ than is present in other primates. Basically, the pendulous nature of human testes\
  \ suggests that our evolution at this time was not based on our ability to kill\
  \ each other with weapons, but rather must have involved some other characteristic.\
  \ The paper and a lot of other sources argue that it was our ability to communicate,\
  \ cooperate, and work together that actually drove the spread of humanity. I find\
  \ the pendulous testes argument for human compassion presented in this paper particularly\
  \ compelling.\n\nThis topic becomes complex, as it involves concepts like ululatory\
  \ crypsis. Whenever you delve into this layer of biology, particularly regarding\
  \ male-female interactions in human evolution, it can get real dicey real quick.\
  \ I believe it's practically impossible to conduct this research without allowing\
  \ the biases of contemporary society and historical context to shape one's explanations.\
  \ Those who do this well are the ones who recognize this challenge and strive to\
  \ navigate around it. However, you will often see individuals who are not adequately\
  \ qualified using arguments from evolutionary psychology to justify their actions,\
  \ which is a classic and enduring human tradition.\n\nAfter Ardipithecus, we encounter\
  \ individuals like Lucy. Lucy is an Australopithecus afarensis, often referred to\
  \ simply as Lucy. This level of classification can get tricky, and I find myself\
  \ second-guessing which terms to use. Lucy... that's right, Lucy. Oh, that's Lucy.\
  \ Lucy was just a surprisingly intact skeleton, which in this world is quite rare.\
  \ She lived around 7 million years ago and was the first obligate biped. Lucy spent\
  \ no time in trees; she spent all her time walking around. She probably could climb\
  \ as well as you could if you spent a lot of time climbing, but this skeleton is\
  \ made for walking bipedally. \n\nThen you get to the period of time that I like\
  \ to call the cacophony of hominins, where there were many different hominin species\
  \ all over the place. It turns out it\u2019s a pretty solid body plan. This includes\
  \ us, Homo neanderthalensis, Homo habilis, and Homo erectus, which was the first\
  \ bipedal skeleton, hence the name. They kept finding older specimens, so the name\
  \ is no longer quite where it once was. Homo habilis is one of my personal favorites;\
  \ they were tool users, using tools before this period. The names are given at the\
  \ time the skeletons are found, with strata in the rocks suggesting tool use around\
  \ that time.\n\nThen, all of them eventually disappeared; they all died somehow.\
  \ That's another one of the strange mysteries; all of our hominid relatives died,\
  \ and it was just us left. There's genetic evidence that we absorbed the Homo neanderthalensis\
  \ rather than killed them; they were bigger than us at a time when we were going\
  \ through an Ice Age. Larger animals typically die faster during such periods because\
  \ they need to eat a lot. There\u2019s evidence that we were hanging out together;\
  \ we probably did kill each other a lot, but we also had more productive relationships,\
  \ which contributed to our survival while they did not. \n\nSo, around this time,\
  \ those relationships were probably quite rough. I mean, we\u2019re talking from\
  \ here back to Australopithecus afarensis, which spans about 7 to 8 million years.\
  \ This is a long time, and we are basically in this era with little bipedal apes.\
  \ Men were running around with sharp rocks, and we were probably just bashing apart\
  \ whoever we found, because that's how nature is, you know? But we really don't\
  \ know. In this era, we find stone tools that have a cool evolutionary story. The\
  \ quality of the stone tools progresses kind of linearly, from, oh, here's a rock\
  \ in a place where it really shouldn't be. At some point, we figured out that some\
  \ rocks are better for bashing than others. Later, we discovered that if you smash\
  \ the rock apart, some parts of it become sharp. We would find places where they\
  \ seemed to just go find a chunk of rock that they liked, and when they needed to\
  \ cut something up, they would just smash it on the ground, pick up the sharp flakes,\
  \ use them for what they needed to do, and then keep smashing. There wasn't a lot\
  \ of planning to it. Over time, you could see that they developed more and more\
  \ sophisticated tools. Eventually, they reached a point where they were making complicated\
  \ flakes, breaking off pieces to create more coherent stone tools and stone blades,\
  \ up to the kinds of stone-tipped spears and arrows that you would associate with\
  \ early humans. We just got better and better at refining our stone tools, until\
  \ they became very complex tools made from smashed apart rocks that we found on\
  \ the ground.\n\nSo, Homo sapiens\u2014yeah, there's this story of evolution being\
  \ a popular narrative, like, 'See all?' Yeah. And I mean, we have a pretty big head.\
  \ I guess I should pull this out before I run out of time. This is Skelly the skeleton.\
  \ Skelly has seen better days, but I don't know if that part closes. We do have\
  \ a pretty large brain case. However, Neanderthals had bigger ones. I won't have\
  \ time for this right now; I\u2019ll have to shuffle around some class stuff to\
  \ have more time to talk about Skelly because I dragged him all the way here from\
  \ JP. We'll talk about it in more detail, but I will not entirely leave you without\
  \ this. If you look at most mammals, they have a ridge on the top of their skull.\
  \ For example, if you pet a dog, you will feel a ridge there. Cats also have this\
  \ to some extent. The gorilla skull, along with most other animals, features this\
  \ structure known as the sagittal crest. The sagittal crest is a muscle attachment\
  \ point. The red on this skeleton represents tendon attachment because muscle does\
  \ not attach to bone; tendons attach to the bone. You can see it on the side of\
  \ the skull. \n\nI bought this skull at a thrift store. I saw it through the window\
  \ and realized that similar pieces usually cost about $800 new. I purchased this\
  \ one for around $300, although I could have tried to negotiate the price down.\
  \ However, I always feel uncomfortable haggling in America, so I accepted the price\
  \ they quoted. \n\nThe muscle attachment on the side of your skull is important.\
  \ If you place your hand on the side of your head and squeeze your jaw, you will\
  \ feel the muscles moving in your jaw. We have a relatively weak bite compared to\
  \ other animals, especially among mammals and apes. Imagine taking that part of\
  \ your weak skull and pushing it together until your fingers meet\u2014that's similar\
  \ to the morphology seen in certain species. The jaw muscles originate from the\
  \ jaw, go through the cheekbone, and attach to the side of your skull. \n\nFor an\
  \ animal that relies on its bite, you want the attachment points to be as robust\
  \ and strong as possible. Over time, we evolved away from that strategy. If you\
  \ imagine inflating the skull like a balloon, you can visualize what remains. Instead\
  \ of having strong, solid attachment points on the top of the head, we now have\
  \ these weak, diffuse attachment points spread out over the sides of the skull.\
  \ However, this allows for significantly more space to accommodate a larger brain.\
  \ This is kind of part of that. This is part of the thing that Lovejoy was talking\
  \ about, trying to make sense of us giving up our greatest weapon of strong bites.\
  \ Then there's the argument that we must have made that decision because we already\
  \ had weapons. The other argument around pendulous comes in, and that\u2019s about\
  \ where that story ends\u2014not really ends, as it goes a lot of places, but that's\
  \ where I'm going to stop talking about it. I'm running out of time, and I have\
  \ more that I want to say about the pelvis, the feet, the knees, and all that kind\
  \ of stuff because in my previous life, I was a locomotion-focused scientist. But\
  \ I\u2019ll leave it here in the sense of talking about tool use and the evolutionary\
  \ record, and kind of this origin of humanity that comes about. Again, there's that\
  \ story around what it was like to be human in the early stages of humanity. One\
  \ of the things that I think gives the best view of what was going on back then\
  \ is from the fossil record, which mostly refers to tools\u2014mostly rocks and\
  \ things like this. We see a progression from simpler stuff like this to more complex\
  \ items. You also find the bones themselves, which are sometimes a challenge because\
  \ fossils don't happen very often; they require a very specific set of circumstances\
  \ for a fossil to occur. The bones we find are sort of random, and things like Lucy\
  \ are very indicative of significant finds. We sometimes find things like burial\
  \ sites, where they would bring their dead. This includes other homos that were\
  \ not us, such as Homo naledi, which was a relatively recent discovery. Within the\
  \ past couple of years, there was the discovery of a burial site where they would\
  \ take their dead to this place deep in a cave. These individuals were basically\
  \ like tiny little monkey men or monkey folk, I suppose. They were taking their\
  \ dead down into this cave and putting them in a particular chamber for some reason.\
  \ They probably didn't speak English, but they had some reasoning for it. They would\
  \ go back to it, and we would find animals. Once you start talking about Homo sapiens,\
  \ which modern humans show up around 200,000 years ago, you can look at any time\
  \ from now to 200,000 years ago. If you picked one of them and raised him in a good\
  \ school, he would be genetically identical to us.\n\nWe find bones of old Homo\
  \ sapiens and old Homo neanderthalensis, and sometimes we find them in burial sites,\
  \ but we also find them, and they were always broken up. They injured themselves\
  \ a lot. One of the primary human superpowers, apparently, relative to other animals\
  \ on Earth, is our healing factor. We heal very effectively and very quickly relative\
  \ to most other mammals. \n\nThis is noteworthy because if we ever know anyone who\
  \ has broken a bone, healing from a broken bone is still kind of slow. It takes\
  \ weeks and months before you are back to your normal speed again. We would find\
  \ old skeletons covered in broken bones, indicating they broke their bones all the\
  \ time and lived very rough lives. If they had broken bones and were still surviving\
  \ to adulthood, that means someone was taking care of them when they were injured.\
  \ They weren't thrown out because they weren't useful; they were cared for and nursed\
  \ back to health.\n\nThere are some cases where they would find skeletons of old\
  \ hominids that were twisted, with limbs that weren't straight, as if they were\
  \ born with a bone disorder. But the creature that had that bone disorder still\
  \ survived to adulthood, which means someone was taking care of them for years.\
  \ Whoever they were, they were not pulling their weight in terms of hunting and\
  \ gathering. If they were able to survive to adulthood, it was because someone else\
  \ in their group found more value in them than what they could contribute in terms\
  \ of raw physical capacity.\n\nWe would also find things like certain types of rocks.\
  \ Sometimes we would find these rocks made out of rose quartz \u2014 rocks that\
  \ are not necessarily good for tools, but they were pretty. We apparently liked\
  \ pretty rocks, and they would find these rocks not out in the open but in burial\
  \ sites. Someone had a hominid friend who died and had their favorite rose quartz.\
  \ Rather than taking this rare, special rock with them, they put it in the ground\
  \ with their dead friend. I think that is something I go back to think about a lot.\
  \ I consider the origins of such stories and what they say about whether or not\
  \ we have any hope in the present moment. There are many stories that people like\
  \ to tell about how harsh, horrible, and rough things are in the world, how only\
  \ the strong survive, and how empathy is viewed as weakness. However, that is really\
  \ not the case. If you go deep down into the bones of the fossil record, empathy\
  \ is the original superpower that allowed us to take down mastodons, survive extinction\
  \ events, and reach the place we are today.\n\nSo, I guess I am legally obligated\
  \ to leave it at that. I will bring this up again at some point in the future so\
  \ I can talk about what Co. Lovejoy called the most phenotypically distinct osteological\
  \ structure in the animal kingdom, otherwise known as the pelvis\u2014not the skull,\
  \ but the pelvis. Other than that, I will leave it there and hope I was able to\
  \ connect it back to something resembling relevance to the current topic. I hope\
  \ that this is not the only time you look into that story, because everything I\
  \ just said is just little tidbits that you should explore further. Talk to the\
  \ bot, Google around about it; whatever I said that you found interesting, dig into\

    \ going to go ahead and get started. This is kind of like\u2014I wouldn't necessarily\
    \ call it a rite of passage; it's more of a shtick than anything else\u2014but\
    \ it's something that I recommend trying to cultivate in yourself if you find\
    \ interest, especially if you're planning on having anything resembling a career\
    \ or a lifetime studying humans, science, and biology. The idea is to have a sense\
    \ in your own mind of what the complete story is: where do you think things come\
    \ from? A big focus in this course is the empiricist game of trying to think about\
    \ how everything can be traced back to some kind of empirical measure. While I\
    \ hope to emphasize that those links are always somewhat fuzzy and murky at best,\
    \ I think one of the cornerstones of scientific thinking is the idea that you're\
    \ not allowed to believe things without some kind of reason for believing them.\
    \ In your daily life, you absolutely can think all sorts of things, and they don't\
    \ have to be particularly grounded. But in the scientific part of life, particularly\
    \ in the world of scientific communication and research, the idea is that everything\
    \ has to be grounded in some way. This particular slice of the large-scale cosmological\
    \ story of human existence is my attempt to cohere everything I know about those\
    \ stories into something resembling a coherent narrative. We're going to be touching\
    \ on topics in which I am very far from an expert\u2014expert enough to teach\
    \ a class like this, but one of the things that happens when you start becoming\
    \ a professional researcher is you realize the difference between being familiar\
    \ with a topic, being an expert in a topic, and being a true expert in a topic.\
    \ These are topics with which I am, at best, quite familiar, but good enough to\
    \ get started. So, first things first: the Big Bang. That's where, as far as we\
    \ understand and as far as we currently believe\u2014we, with a capital 'W,' meaning\
    \ humans as a whole\u2014that's where we believe things started. Or at least,\
    \ that's the beginning of the story that we can tell. The Big Bang is our current\
    \ culturally preferred creation myth, and like all good creation myths, it explains\
    \ a lot of the data."

  text: "The data, as we can explain, but also like all creation myths that have come\
    \ before, really doesn't explain everything. It's not a fully coherent story.\
    \ For example, in ancient Japan, there was a myth that Japan was formed by a god\
    \ who stuck a sword into the water and pulled it out, and the droplets formed\
    \ the islands. That's a pretty good story to help you understand where to find\
    \ more islands. If you go east, you're not going to find any. If you go west,\
    \ you find a big landmass. If you go down southwest, you're going to find a big\
    \ string of islands. So, it's useful in that regard, but it\u2019s not particularly\
    \ satisfying from a geological perspective.\n\nSimilarly, a lot of the Western\
    \ tradition is based off the cosmology of the Bible, which we don't really tend\
    \ to think about beyond the sort of 'let there be light' aspect of it. If you\
    \ go back and read just the first 150 words, there\u2019s a reference. It's sort\
    \ of based off a more ancient kind of Hebrew cosmology where we\u2019re living\
    \ in a bubble in a giant ocean, where there's an infinite ocean and the stars\
    \ form like a dome. We\u2019re like this crust of Earth floating on an infinite\
    \ ocean, and the fixed stars are the thing holding it up. That was kind of enough\
    \ to explain why there are such things as fixed stars, which we know now are not\
    \ fixed; they\u2019re just really far away. And there are these other things called\
    \ planets that zip around on the inside, which we used to think were part of these\
    \ spheres, one inside the other. \n\nAgain, these are sort of stories that helped\
    \ us to make sense of the scientific data that we had. But I bet if you were to\
    \ sit down with any of the scholars of the time and really ask them how certain\
    \ they were that this was the full story, I would hope at least that they would\
    \ give you an answer somewhat similar to what you would get from a modern cosmologist\
    \ who would say, 'Well, it\u2019s almost certainly not true, that story that we\
    \ tell.' And we know that it\u2019s not true because everything we\u2019ve thought\
    \ before has also been proven to be not true, and everything that we continue\
    \ to learn causes us to reshape that story. \n\nWith things like the Big Bang,\
    \ it explains why if you look out you see expansion in all directions. If you\
    \ sort of roll the clock back on something that\u2019s always expanding in all\
    \ directions, you eventually get to a place where it\u2019s in a small compact\
    \ space. And then, you can do all sorts of more specific, complex global-scale\
    \ scientific efforts, involving such things as radio telescopes on the Earth,\
    \ on the tops of mountains, and in low Earth orbit. I guess not so low Earth orbit\
    \ anymore. You can tell all sorts of stories that make sense, but in the same\
    \ way that the sword in the water doesn't really explain everything, there is\
    \ still much more to uncover."

  text: "To know about Japan, the Big Bang also doesn't explain everything there is\
    \ to know about the Universe. There was just a popular article about some recent\
    \ modeling discovery. The data might make more sense if we give up on the concept\
    \ of the conservation of energy, and that might sort of explain the data better,\
    \ which would seem like a big tradeoff. But we've actually given that up before\
    \ when we started moving towards relativity. Well, that's not really true; but\
    \ anyways, the point is, if you want to tell a story that's grounded in empirical\
    \ research, it's typically going to start with something like the Big Bang. The\
    \ Big Bang was a massive explosion\u2014where, you know, despite the past couple\
    \ of weeks notwithstanding, all of the energy in the universe was made available\
    \ at that time. So, as far as I understand it, the story is that in those initial\
    \ moments of expansion, everything was there, including a bunch of antimatter\
    \ and a bunch of matter\u2014however you want to define those things. I'm not\
    \ really there. When put into contact with each other, they obliterate themselves\
    \ and are replaced with the equivalent, E=mc\xB2, of energy. That initial obliteration\
    \ of matter and antimatter is thought to be the source of all the energy. Most\
    \ of that explosion turned into light and heat and things like that. Chemistry\
    \ wasn't a thing yet; we'll get to that in a bit. In one of the perhaps oldest\
    \ scientific mysteries, whatever obliteration happened in those first picoseconds\
    \ of the universe was not symmetric. After all, the matter and antimatter obliterated\
    \ themselves, and there was some stuff left over, which is very convenient for\
    \ us because that's everything that we know and care about. Some of the oldest\
    \ theories, not the oldest because they are actually quite recent, involve the\
    \ strange math of symmetry breaking in physics, which tries to understand why\
    \ there was something left over after that initial obliteration. Emmy Noether\
    \ is a name associated with this, and she also has the historical interest of\
    \ being a female physicist from way back when that wasn't common. There are some\
    \ strange stories of scientists you've heard of, like Einstein, who tricked universities\
    \ into hiring her."

  text: "She did a bunch of early math on symmetry, baking, and physics. Anyway, after\
    \ those first picoseconds of expansion, all the energy that we could ever care\
    \ about, as far as we know, is created. Then, for a period of time, which I'm\
    \ actually not familiar with the exact amount, that's all that there was\u2014\
    a bunch of plasma and extremely hot gas, which was too hot to do anything that\
    \ we would think of as a gas. As that expansion continued outward, the universe\
    \ cooled off, as things tend to do, and slowly but surely, the initial stuff of\
    \ the universe started to coalesce. I think the first things that formed, which\
    \ we would recognize, were things like the quarks, protons, and electrons, and\
    \ then our very first good friends named hydrogen. Those gases would slowly, or\
    \ actually not that slowly, form what's called the periodic table.\n\nIf you want\
    \ to talk about the history of biology, you do have to start with the Big Bang\
    \ because the Big Bang explains why you have such a weird thing as this. This\
    \ is also a nice approximation of truth\u2014a very useful configuration of letters\
    \ that have a lot of meaning associated with them. As far as the story we are\
    \ telling, we've just reached here. Hydrogen forms at some point in the history\
    \ of the early universe; I should know that number\u2014maybe next year I will.\
    \ But slowly over time, those gases cool down, and you get such a strange thing\
    \ as a nebula. A nebula is just a big cloud of gas floating through space.\n\n\
    Nebulae form because of gravity, which is something that pulls matter together.\
    \ So, if you have a bunch of random stuff floating through the universe and there's\
    \ nothing else going on, the heat makes things zip apart from each other while\
    \ gravity makes things pull towards each other. It turns out that's a pretty important\
    \ distinction for the rest of the time to come. As the universe starts to cool\
    \ down, particles begin to pull in on themselves, forming big clouds called nebulae.\
    \ Eventually, you get enough of these gases together. I say gases, but really,\
    \ there is only one gas at this point\u2014hydrogen. There might be\u2014I don't\
    \ even think there's helium yet. I think it's just hydrogen. And it gets to a\
    \ point where there's enough of it that the gas pulls in on itself even more.\

    \ it's not exactly friction, the compression from gravity causes another very\
    \ important event in the history of our universe: the ignition of the first stars.\
    \ Now, it is truly an ignition. I'm going to speed up here because it's important\
    \ to get to the parts of this that actually have neurons and stuff to make it\
    \ relevant to the course, but I promise it's at least a little bit relevant. So,\
    \ basically, you have the big clouds that slowly condense down until they become\
    \ spheroids. As gravity pushes in, the gases get hotter until eventually, some\
    \ strange quantum effect happens. It's not exactly like a combustion engine in\
    \ your car; it's more like a quantum superposition thing, I guess. But eventually,\
    \ it gets squished together enough that you get a very strange effect called fusion.\
    \ Fusion is what happens when you take something that looks like one proton and\
    \ one electron and you get them close enough together that some strange event\
    \ occurs, and they become something like helium. Once that process happens, fusion\
    \ is an extremely exothermic reaction, meaning a massive amount of energy is released\
    \ when these hydrogen atoms form into helium. So now, the collapsing force of\
    \ gravity is pushed back against by the exploding force of fusion, resulting in\
    \ a stable star that is happily burning hydrogen into helium. Good job for that\
    \ star! Now, that lasts for a good little while. So basically, right now, this\
    \ star\u2014which if I knew more about stars, I would know the type of\u2014well,\
    \ I don't, so let's not worry about it. This star is now burning its fuel, which\
    \ is hydrogen, and the output of that fuel burning is helium. Everything is going\
    \ well until eventually, the star runs out of gas, and it no longer has more hydrogen,\
    \ leaving only helium. The force of compression is not\u2026"

  text: "...enough to fuse helium into beryllium and beyond. Some of those details\
    \ about the elements will come out shortly, but this is good enough for our conversation.\
    \ Eventually, when all the helium is gone and the fusion force is no longer counteracting\
    \ the force of gravity, the star begins to collapse again. As it collapses, it\
    \ becomes denser and hotter until eventually, you have enough force\u2014enough\
    \ energy\u2014to start fusing helium into beryllium and lithium. With this process,\
    \ you begin forming heavier elements. That's math, that's chemistry, that's cosmology.\
    \ There are probably many other details involved; I\u2019m sure you all are learning\
    \ about those in your classes right now. So we burn through our hydrogen, and\
    \ we start burning our helium. This process, like the previous one, is also fusion\
    \ and is extremely exothermic, but it is less efficient than the fusion of hydrogen.\
    \ Helium plus helium equals beryllium, which produces less energy than hydrogen\
    \ plus hydrogen equals helium. But that's okay because we are now in a new phase\
    \ of the star\u2019s life. We\u2019re burning hydrogen and making beryllium, and\
    \ this process lasts quite a long time until eventually, we start running out\
    \ of helium. You get that same sort of process revisited; it probably overlaps\u2014\
    it\u2019s not a clear-cut sequence. Eventually, the star tries to collapse again,\
    \ and then it gets hot enough to start fusing beryllium into other, more complex\
    \ elements that come about. This process works efficiently for a long time where\
    \ the best reaction is still hydrogen to helium, but as you begin losing that\
    \ fuel, the star collapses and heats up until it can fuse different elements into\
    \ heavier ones. This process continues all the way up to and including iron, which\
    \ is a very useful element in daily life. Iron marks a significant point in the\
    \ progression of chemical complexity because the process of fusion\u2014which\
    \ I\u2019m not entirely sure about, whether it\u2019s the direct fusion of hydrogen\
    \ or subsequent reactions\u2014is not sufficient to counteract the crushing force\
    \ of gravity. When that happens, the star begins to collapse further down.  "

  text: As it's going, basically every time it burns through one of these elements,
    the time it takes to start burning the other one and run out gets smaller and
    smaller. By the time you get to iron, the collapsing doesn't even take long. It
    takes longer to do it and also has diminishing returns; you get less bang for
    your buck, I suppose. Until eventually, once you get past iron, that explosion
    no longer stops the clock. It's no longer enough to keep the star coherent. You
    get this process where the star starts to collapse in on itself, chunk by chunk,
    piece by piece. Every time the outer core collapses, it hits the inner core, creating
    another pressure spike. That pressure spike is where you get most of these other
    heavier elements, until you start getting into some kind of elements that may
    only exist in labs towards the bottom. Once all of that depends on the size of
    the star and the makeup of the star, this process of burning through the different
    chemicals and then this final process of collapsing eventually results in an explosion,
    which is what we tend to call a supernova. That supernova is when all these weird,
    extra fancy, strange, relatively rare chemicals get spewed out into the universe.
    Everything we know and care about, all the weird chemistry that does all the cool
    stuff, comes from this type of process. The strange thing about this, which I
    find really, I mean, aside from all of it, really kind of troubling, is that a
    lot of the things you talk about when discussing space involve time frames on
    the order of millions of years and tens of millions of years. The process of burning
    down from hydrogen to helium could take millions to tens of millions of years.
    However, this process after iron, of slamming down and exploding outwards, happens
    in just two weeks. A star-scale explosion, big enough to rip our entire solar
    system apart, can occur within that time frame, like between now and the end of
    the poster presentation. That's a little troubling but very useful for biology
    because this is where all the good stuff comes from. Now, there are a couple of
    things to note here when we're talking about the chemistry. In terms of you and
    me, most of the stuff that we're made of and that we care about tends to exist

  text: 'Pretty low on that list. So when we think of hydrogen, you''ve got your carbon,
    nitrogen, and oxygen. These are really our best friends. The fact that they are
    above this line means that there is a ton of this stuff in the universe, in particular,
    a good friend, oxygen, and our good friend, hydrogen. Carbon is also hanging out
    all over the place. Because of the prevalence of hydrogen and oxygen everywhere,
    that also means you get tons and tons of water. There is lots and lots of water
    in the universe just floating around. There are many stellar processes whose output
    is just water ice being flung out into the universe. We read about one star that
    they were observing, and they thought that it was emitting trillions of times
    the amount of water on the surface of the Earth every second for millions of years.
    There is no shortage of water in the universe, and all these other elements that
    hang around it, like carbons and nitrogens, are similarly prevalent. So, that''s
    useful. Another useful element is silica, or silicon. This is where you get rocks.
    You can get rocks from all sorts of places, but silicon and silicates make up
    rocky stuff, which is again very useful for humans.


    As this sort of strange chemistry is going on, I believe that the timescale of
    the universe is about 12 billion years. I think that''s the number we tend to
    say. I don''t really know what those numbers mean, as that''s one of those figures
    that changes from time to time. On that scale, most of the time of the universe
    has been spent just doing this and getting to the point where we''re burning through
    all these elements. In terms of percentage, most of the universe has been spent
    doing this stuff. Where are we at? Yeah, so in terms of our list of things, we''ve
    gone from the Big Bang to nebulae, to stars. Then the stars start exploding, and
    that''s where you get the weird chemistry. The weird chemistry is where you start
    getting things like planets. That same sort of process of accretion, where nebulae
    turn into stars, and then the stars start to explode and spill their guts out,
    leads to other types of dust, and that other type of dust can form.'

    the Pacific Ocean, but that would be incorrect. The answer is Europa, or possibly
    Enceladus; I''m not sure which one. Both are moons of Saturn. They are ice planets,
    so from the outside, they appear to have a shield of ice. However, they have geothermal
    activity, meaning their cores are warm. Between the core of ice and the rocky
    interior, there is a warm liquid water ocean that we have never seen. We have
    flown spacecraft through the geysers that erupt from these moons, and when we
    analyze the dust thrown up by these geysers, we find that it contains methane.
    I''m not claiming that life exists down there, but I would like to investigate.
    Now we are on a planet and, as far as I know, we no longer need beryllium. I think
    we use beryllium to make the lenses for thermal cameras because it can bend the
    wavelengths of light necessary for that purpose, but I do not need it in my day-to-day

    checked in on it in some time, but my understanding is that we believe the origin
    of life began with something that resembles RNA, which is a self-replicating molecule.
    The self-replicating characteristic is crucial because once one of these molecules

    \ a single-purpose entry-exit point. You have an inside and an outside, and that's\

    \ tube go all the way through and separate our concerns. We'll call this the mouth,\
    \ and we'll have another opening for the exit, which we can name later.\" Now\

    \ learn how to eat the things that can generate their own energy. So they start\

    The jawless fish are believed to be the first vertebrates. Our closest modern
    relatives among jawless fish are lampreys. Lampreys look quite unusual but are
    considered the earliest vertebrate or chordate animals. They share a somewhat
    similar appearance with leeches, which are invertebrates, but lampreys have a
    distinct sucker-like look. This topic is getting a bit beyond my depth of details,
    but if I had to guess, they both emerged around similar times. However, leeches
    evolved later as bloodsuckers or parasites, which means they probably appeared
    after there were other animals to feed on. Lampreys have a spinal cord running
    down their bodies, but I am unsure if they possess bones or are cartilaginous
    like sharks. Lampreys are important; they often appear in neuroscience conferences,
    such as the Society for Neuroscience. Their significance lies in the fact that
    they represent the oldest and phylogenetically most ancient chordates, which connects
    to the evolution of vertebrates. So, after the jawless fish, we have the bony
    fish, which possess skulls and spinal columns.

  text: Things like eyeballs emerged around 450 million years ago, which is quite
    some time. Whether or not this is the first of this type of organism or just the
    first one that left behind a substantial number of fossils is unclear. However,
    these are indeed the oldest eyeballs we know about that we would consider similar
    to our own. Many organisms, like clams and mussels, have eyestalks; they possess
    photosensitive chemicals and small optical objects. But these particular creatures
    have proper eyeballs. In this paper, which is one of my favorites, Mike Land discusses
    evidence suggesting that even at this level of evolution, 450 million years ago,
    these creatures probably had eye movement patterns similar to our own. They appear
    to have eye muscles and the machinery necessary for something akin to the vestibulo-ocular
    reflex, which I've emphasized a lot. This reflex enables your eyes to counter-rotate
    when you move your head. I talked about how ancient it is, and how you cannot
    lose the vestibulo-ocular reflex without also being dead; it's at least this ancient.
    In the simplified version of the story, the reasoning is the same for why organisms
    need such mechanisms. Options are slow; they take a while to respond to light.
    Therefore, if they are going to form an image, they must have a stabilization
    mechanism. Given that opsins have existed for billions of years, their chemistry
    comes from the primordial era. Once you reach the point where animals can form
    detailed images of the world, it is necessary to couple the vision process with
    a stabilization mechanism for gaze relative to the world. This paper goes through
    and examines various animals, arguing that all forms of vision, any animal with
    good vision, exhibit this saccade and fixation strategy with some form of gaze
    stabilization similar to the vestibulo-ocular reflex.

    of living in the trees. They were arboreal creatures, so they lived in trees.
    Because they were arboreal, they walked around on branches, and their main appendages
    had to be grabby. This started to develop a very tight coupling between the perceptual
    system and the motor system early in this era of evolution. As we were like squirrels,
    running around on branches and grabbing and moving, it makes sense that we currently
    have such a tight coupling between our perceptual and upper limb appendage system.
    Our local motor system required this very close perceptual-motor loop. Then we

    \ structure known as the sagittal crest. The sagittal crest is a muscle attachment\
    \ point. The red on this skeleton represents tendon attachment because muscle\
    \ does not attach to bone; tendons attach to the bone. You can see it on the side\
    \ of the skull. \n\nI bought this skull at a thrift store. I saw it through the\
    \ window and realized that similar pieces usually cost about $800 new. I purchased\
    \ this one for around $300, although I could have tried to negotiate the price\
    \ down. However, I always feel uncomfortable haggling in America, so I accepted\
    \ the price they quoted. \n\nThe muscle attachment on the side of your skull is\
    \ important. If you place your hand on the side of your head and squeeze your\
    \ jaw, you will feel the muscles moving in your jaw. We have a relatively weak\
    \ bite compared to other animals, especially among mammals and apes. Imagine taking\
    \ that part of your weak skull and pushing it together until your fingers meet\u2014\
    that's similar to the morphology seen in certain species. The jaw muscles originate\
    \ from the jaw, go through the cheekbone, and attach to the side of your skull.\
    \ \n\nFor an animal that relies on its bite, you want the attachment points to\
    \ be as robust and strong as possible. Over time, we evolved away from that strategy.\
    \ If you imagine inflating the skull like a balloon, you can visualize what remains.\
    \ Instead of having strong, solid attachment points on the top of the head, we\
    \ now have these weak, diffuse attachment points spread out over the sides of\
    \ the skull. However, this allows for significantly more space to accommodate\
    \ a larger brain."

    \ we already had weapons. The other argument around pendulous comes in, and that\u2019\
    s about where that story ends\u2014not really ends, as it goes a lot of places,\
    \ but that's where I'm going to stop talking about it. I'm running out of time,\
    \ and I have more that I want to say about the pelvis, the feet, the knees, and\
    \ all that kind of stuff because in my previous life, I was a locomotion-focused\
    \ scientist. But I\u2019ll leave it here in the sense of talking about tool use\
    \ and the evolutionary record, and kind of this origin of humanity that comes\
    \ about. Again, there's that story around what it was like to be human in the\
    \ early stages of humanity. One of the things that I think gives the best view\
    \ of what was going on back then is from the fossil record, which mostly refers\
    \ to tools\u2014mostly rocks and things like this. We see a progression from simpler\
    \ stuff like this to more complex items. You also find the bones themselves, which\
    \ are sometimes a challenge because fossils don't happen very often; they require\
    \ a very specific set of circumstances for a fossil to occur. The bones we find\
    \ are sort of random, and things like Lucy are very indicative of significant\
    \ finds. We sometimes find things like burial sites, where they would bring their\
    \ dead. This includes other homos that were not us, such as Homo naledi, which\
    \ was a relatively recent discovery. Within the past couple of years, there was\
    \ the discovery of a burial site where they would take their dead to this place\
    \ deep in a cave. These individuals were basically like tiny little monkey men\
    \ or monkey folk, I suppose."

    \ chamber for some reason. They probably didn't speak English, but they had some\
    \ reasoning for it. They would go back to it, and we would find animals. Once\
    \ you start talking about Homo sapiens, which modern humans show up around 200,000\
    \ years ago, you can look at any time from now to 200,000 years ago. If you picked\
    \ one of them and raised him in a good school, he would be genetically identical\
    \ to us.\n\nWe find bones of old Homo sapiens and old Homo neanderthalensis, and\
    \ sometimes we find them in burial sites, but we also find them, and they were\
    \ always broken up. They injured themselves a lot. One of the primary human superpowers,\
    \ apparently, relative to other animals on Earth, is our healing factor. We heal\
    \ very effectively and very quickly relative to most other mammals. \n\nThis is\
    \ noteworthy because if we ever know anyone who has broken a bone, healing from\
    \ a broken bone is still kind of slow. It takes weeks and months before you are\
    \ back to your normal speed again. We would find old skeletons covered in broken\
    \ bones, indicating they broke their bones all the time and lived very rough lives.\
    \ If they had broken bones and were still surviving to adulthood, that means someone\
    \ was taking care of them when they were injured. They weren't thrown out because\
    \ they weren't useful; they were cared for and nursed back to health.\n\nThere\
    \ are some cases where they would find skeletons of old hominids that were twisted,\
    \ with limbs that weren't straight, as if they were born with a bone disorder.\
    \ But the creature that had that bone disorder still survived to adulthood, which\
    \ means someone was taking care of them for years. Whoever they were, they were\
    \ not pulling their weight in terms of hunting and gathering. If they were able\
    \ to survive to adulthood, it was because someone else in their group found more\
    \ value in them than what they could contribute in terms of raw physical capacity.\n\
    \nWe would also find things like certain types of rocks. Sometimes we would find\
    \ these rocks made out of rose quartz \u2014 rocks that are not necessarily good\
    \ for tools, but they were pretty. We apparently liked pretty rocks, and they\
    \ would find these rocks not out in the open but in burial sites."

    \ Rather than taking this rare, special rock with them, they put it in the ground\

    \ lot. I consider the origins of such stories and what they say about whether\
    \ or not we have any hope in the present moment. There are many stories that people\
    \ like to tell about how harsh, horrible, and rough things are in the world, how\

    \ Talk to the bot, Google around about it; whatever I said that you found interesting,\
