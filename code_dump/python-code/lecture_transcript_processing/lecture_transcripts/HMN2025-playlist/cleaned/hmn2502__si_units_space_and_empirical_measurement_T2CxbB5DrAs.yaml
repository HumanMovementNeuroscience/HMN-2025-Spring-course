full_transcript: "Okay, hello, hi. Thank you, and welcome to whatever this is. So,\
  \ yeah, let's do the standard check-in. I am recording this and we'll be posting\
  \ it online. A couple of people have been sporadically contacting me saying things\
  \ like, \"Hey, I'm sick. I'm not going to make it to class,\" or, \"Hey, I'm not\
  \ going to make the deadline.\" If you're sick, straight up, don't come to class.\
  \ We had a whole pandemic, so please let us learn that lesson as a culture. You\
  \ don't need to check with me; it's totally fine, I trust you. Also, the deadlines\
  \ are all kind of made up. I put them there in the sense of, I really hope everyone\
  \ has it done by this point because I use the data from that for each stage. However,\
  \ they're all available until the end of the semester. With the exception of the\
  \ poster thing, there are a couple of hard deadlines for that, which you need to\
  \ get to the printer on time and stuff like that. Everything else, just get it done\
  \ as soon as you can. I understand that's a dangerous thing to say to some people,\
  \ but I trust you, I believe in you. Just check all the boxes before the end of\
  \ the semester and we'll be good to go. Now, let's do a quick check-in on schedules.\
  \ What did we do last Wednesday? Can you remind me? Did I talk or did the group\
  \ thing? Group thing? Yeah, the group thing was good. Great. Then we had something\
  \ that was due. And today, what fun! We're going to be talking about a lecture that\
  \ I've given multiple times and I always enjoy giving. It's going to be an introduction\
  \ to measurement and the concepts pertaining to it. And check this out\u2014look\
  \ what you get to do when you're in charge: no assignment! I feel like we've been\
  \ doing enough; you guys are doing great. This is the right day, cool. Today's lecture\
  \ will be about measurement units and things like that. Hopefully, it's got a lot\
  \ of props and visual aids. I want to do it now because on Wednesday, I think we\
  \ can do a free in-class recording, which will be our first relationship with more\
  \ classical data. I keep referring to the text stuff. that you're punching into\
  \ the server as data. It is data. If you had asked me three years ago if that was\
  \ data, I would have said, \"Yeah, I guess technically,\" but it's only since AI\
  \ came online that I think of that as data. Freeo Cap is a motion capture, sort\
  \ of a free open-source project that I've been building for the past half-decade\
  \ or so of my life. It is specifically designed to create good classroom demos and\
  \ things like that. So we're going to be recording some data and then talking about\
  \ it in the context of the kinds of concepts we're going to cover today. Hopefully,\
  \ we can get some of that in today.\n\nLet's see, is there anything else to catch\
  \ up on? Just for completeness, I will remind everybody although nothing special\
  \ has happened with this round, in the server, in the links and resources, find\
  \ the server scrape checkpoint. At the bottom, there is the same sort of 127. That's\
  \ the server scraped and analyzed as of this morning. So the same thing, download\
  \ it, unzip it; if you don't know what unzipping is, it's the action where you double-click\
  \ and it makes a folder next door that you can open like a regular file. You can\
  \ search for your name in there.\n\nI will be refactoring the way we do the student\
  \ profile-building process, so your individual profiles are going to change probably\
  \ next week. This change is because I realized that it would give you a much more\
  \ precise measurement of your interests if I didn't use everything you put in the\
  \ server for the profile but just the assignment chats, the ones from your intro\
  \ and the poster presentation. Additionally, I'm in the process of setting something\
  \ up that will allow you to ask the bot to remember you in a given chat, and it\
  \ will pull that history into the conversation. This way, you won't have to start\
  \ every conversation from scratch.\n\nAlso, just as a reminder for helping you learn\
  \ the paths and whatnot, here we are on the server. In the same channel up here,\
  \ links and resources and course repository, click on that and something pops up.\
  \ I don't know why two things pop up. This is the course repository, which is the\
  \ most up-to-date. Oh, actually, I forgot to update the syllabus last time. Syllabus\
  \ commit in sync. Yes, thank you. Don't break. All right, the same thing on FireofFox.\
  \ You see it says \"Update Syllabus,\" which is the thing I just pushed up. Now\
  \ the text is updated, and that's the code for primates. This is called GitHub;\
  \ that's kind of what GitHub does. It's a version control software, similar to track\
  \ changes but more sophisticated. Pretty much every piece of software you've ever\
  \ used in your life has used Git at some level. I'm kind of hijacking it to do text-based\
  \ stuff. So yeah, and just to be clear, just for fun, this site is basically like\
  \ a folder. The readme here is the item that's posted down there. This is what it\
  \ looks like formatted. That's what it looks like raw. This is an honest measurement\
  \ and record of exactly what my primate body did to a keyboard at some point in\
  \ time. So it is a truth-preserving record of my thoughts in a way that a .docx\
  \ file or a Google Drive link never will be. So shout out to Markdown and raw text\
  \ formats.\n\nOkay, right. So on this page, let\u2019s go back to the front page.\
  \ There we go, in the lectures folder for 20 25127 Intro to Measurement. The top\
  \ one is called \"Intro to Measurement,\" and here we go. These are the notes for\
  \ the lecture that we're about to give. With that, I'm going to switch away from\
  \ GitHub and go to my local version, just because I want to. Local meaning on this\
  \ machine, not on the internet or on some other server. GitHub is owned by Microsoft,\
  \ so technically that data is hosted on Microsoft. This is on my computer. Okay,\
  \ cool. This is a brief summary; we'll see how much we get through. I think we'll\
  \ get through all of it. So here we are in this class, extensively to teach you\
  \ all what science is, what science looks like, and how you might ever do it. Such\
  \ a wacky thing as to attempt to know the world and do empirical research within\
  \ it. There are a lot of things that get taken for granted when you live as a human\
  \ person in the world that you start to find yourself needing to become much more\
  \ specific about once you actually start to get into the business of knowledge generation.\
  \ The idea, as a scientist, is that you are attempting to create new knowledge for\
  \ humankind, which is a very difficult thing to do. It's hard to know stuff, and\
  \ there are certain rules for how to do that. \n\nA lot of what we talk about in\
  \ the sciences, the empirical sciences, is based on the concept of empirical measurement.\
  \ There are many ways to know things. The scientific method and empirical method\
  \ is one way to know the world; it's a very powerful way to understand it because\
  \ it allows you to do things like make predictions about the future, build tools,\
  \ and heal people when they're sick. Everything in that conception of knowledge\
  \ is based, at some level, on an empirical measurement of the world. \n\nEmpirical\
  \ measurement is something we will talk a bit about, but basically, it's the idea\
  \ that you have done some kind of measurement. That term, measurement, is one of\
  \ those terms that often gets taken for granted. One important thing to remember\
  \ when you're considering empirical research and the concept of measurement is that\
  \ everything you are doing, everything you are building on, has to be built relative\
  \ to something else. \n\nIf you're trying to generate new knowledge, that knowledge\
  \ will be based on other things, like the term \u201Ctruth preserving,\u201D which\
  \ is very important in the philosophy of science. This concept allows you to build\
  \ from one thing that you know to another thing that you might know. Everything\
  \ you think you know about the world is based on some kind of background reasoning:\
  \ \"I think this because I learned that; I believe this because of all that kind\
  \ of stuff.\" \n\nSo, it's helpful when you are learning the concepts of measurement\
  \ to try to recreate those epistemological chains, where epistemology is the study\
  \ of knowledge, and ask yourself where these connections lie. If I were to redo\
  \ this, which I will sometime, I probably would have put this one... Up top, the\
  \ most important thing is that skepticism is the basis of scientific reality. Skepticism,\
  \ in short, is the idea that you have to have reasons to believe the things that\
  \ you believe. You are not allowed to just believe things for no reason. Everything\
  \ that you consider has to be examined closely, and you need to try to understand\
  \ what it is connected to. Given that, it is reasonable to ask about origins and\
  \ the classical philosophical bedrock of belief. We tend to ascribe this concept\
  \ to Descartes, who was operating in the 1500s. You may have heard of his Cartesian\
  \ coordinates and various other things that we will talk about at different points\
  \ in time. He was engaged in a philosophical inquiry, attempting to understand what\
  \ his knowledge of the world was based on, and he came across a wonderful little\
  \ phrase called \"Cogito, ergo sum,\" which means \"I think, therefore I am.\" This\
  \ is essentially a fancy way of stating that if you drill down to the core, the\
  \ only thing you can actually know and believe without referencing any other kind\
  \ of knowledge is that you are experiencing consciousness in this very moment. You\
  \ are having a qualitative state; you are thinking, and nothing in the universe\
  \ can fake the experience of having a conscious experience right now. Your memories\
  \ of yesterday could be deceitful; you might have been under the influence of hallucinogenics\
  \ or someone could have been manipulating your brain. Your perception of the world\
  \ around you could also be false. For instance, I might think there's a cup out\
  \ there, but I could be wearing some sort of VR helmet or floating in goop in The\
  \ Matrix. All these things we want to believe are, in some way, subjects to skepticism.\
  \ You can doubt the veracity of anything besides that central idea of \"I am having\
  \ a conscious experience right now.\" If you choose to live with that nihilistic\
  \ belief, you end up with a rather uninteresting philosophical position called solipsism,\
  \ which is the belief that you are the only person that exists and everything else\
  \ around you is fake, with all other people being mere illusions. This is technically\
  \ the only truly defensible philosophical position, but it\u2019s not useful or\
  \ helpful, nor is it particularly interesting. If you are willing to accept other\
  \ gradients of belief and truth into your life, you can begin to explore... Build\
  \ what feels like knowledge about the real world. As long as you're willing to have\
  \ trust in memory, and if you're willing to sort of combine all your memories and\
  \ then believe in something like statistics, you can actually do quite a lot with\
  \ that. Yes, I can doubt that there is a cup in front of me right now, but if I\
  \ keep looking and it keeps happening, and I keep moving and it has the sort of\
  \ geometrically reasonable deformations, then I reach out, and I have a cup in my\
  \ hand. When I put it to my mouth and get liquid, at a certain point, the accumulation\
  \ of those sensory experiences starts to resemble something like knowledge about\
  \ the real world. It becomes increasingly likely that there is, in fact, something\
  \ resembling a cup somewhere outside of my conscious experience. This is great because\
  \ it allows us to connect with each other in this universe based on our shared memories\
  \ and statistics. Luckily, that is not really that hard to do, but it is somewhat\
  \ troubling to think too closely about. From an epistemological point of view, we\
  \ will base our knowledge on the awareness that we exist, which is good. Then, I\
  \ hate to say it, but the only other things we have are memory and statistics. Not\
  \ a lot, but we can work from there. \n\nNow, I\u2019m going to shift away from\
  \ that sort of philosophical, epistemological space and move back into the more\
  \ rigidly empirical world of direct measurements. We will still have a similar game\
  \ to play there because when we think about something like measurement, we need\
  \ to base that measurement on something. So let's discuss measuring things, and\
  \ I think we can start with a really basic measurement called distance, or spatial\
  \ distance. This lecture has a lot of props and visual aids, all made roughly speaking\
  \ from trash that I found outside. This is a stick that happens to be roughly a\
  \ meter long and can be screwed apart. It was actually the stem of a lamp that I\
  \ found, and I didn't end up liking the lamp, but then I realized that if I... I\
  \ pulled it apart so I could stop having to bring a meter-long broomstick onto campus\
  \ once a semester. So, you need to find one that I can see. A hiking stick could\
  \ probably work well here. This is a stick, which has a length. If you wanted to\
  \ measure things in the world, you could use something like this. Let's pretend\
  \ that this stick is one meter long, even though it's actually slightly longer than\
  \ that. We'll pretend that it's a meter, and we want to measure something. Let\u2019\
  s see, I brought colors today, so we'll see how that goes for us\u2014RGB, red,\
  \ green. We start with black, I guess. If we're trying to measure the length of\
  \ things, let\u2019s say we're trying to measure the length of the room or how tall\
  \ you are, or how tall this stick is, whatever. We're going to want to eventually\
  \ write these numbers down. We're going to have some sort of a measurement tool\
  \ like this, or, you know, a tape measure, and we're going to make some measurements.\
  \ Then we will write them down. When we write them down, we're writing down a number\
  \ of some kind. Let\u2019s skip a couple of steps to get to the point where we've\
  \ written down a bunch of numbers. Now we want to represent them to communicate\
  \ that we've conducted a scientific study on how long various things are, and we\
  \ want to present this research to our colleagues. So, we have various ways of measuring\
  \ things like space and time. We're going to start with space and then eventually\
  \ get to time, which won\u2019t take long\u2014don\u2019t worry about it. The first\
  \ thing you might want when measuring things are dimensions. You have one-dimensional,\
  \ two-dimensional, three-dimensional, and high-dimensional measurements. We'll talk\
  \ about these things in a moment. In all these cases, it\u2019s going to start with\
  \ something resembling an origin. This is the origin; it is a zero-dimensional object.\
  \ It contains no real information other than it exists. This point conveys the information,\
  \ \"Hello, yes, I exist,\" and not really that much else. It\u2019s not particularly\
  \ useful scientifically, but it\u2019s very important when you\u2019re trying to\
  \ figure out if I come to you and say, \"Oh, hey, that thing is three and a half\
  \ sticks long,\" that is implicitly relative to something that is zero sticks long,\
  \ which is something that has no extent. So, zero-dimensional, great. Good job!\
  \ Now, let's think about this dimension, and let's call it X, because that's traditionally\
  \ how we do it. This is now a one-dimensional object. Let's say this is infinitely\
  \ long, and we've measured this to be one stick long. So, there you go, one stick\
  \ long. Then I can measure two sticks, three sticks, etc. That's way better. So\
  \ now, if I'm going around measuring things, I can keep track of the length of the\
  \ thing. But again, this is not particularly exciting. There's not really a point\
  \ in drawing that; you just write down the number. You don't gain anything by looking\
  \ at that number relative to zero, other than just the knowledge of how numbers\
  \ work. So, we're going to call that X. We're also going to call that length. Great!\
  \ So now we want to measure things. This is good for measuring things like string\
  \ or distances from here to your house or the height of a person. But now we want\
  \ to measure different things. We're still doing stuff in length and distances,\
  \ and now we're going to split and have a second dimension that we'll call Y. We'll\
  \ also call that height, and it uses the same unit. So, you can still be one stick\
  \ tall or two sticks tall, things like that. Now you can measure things like boards,\
  \ desks, and floors. If you measure something that is two units long and one unit\
  \ tall, then that's a point in that space. That is a two-dimensional point, meaning\
  \ it has two numbers you have to use to define it. In the robotics world someday,\
  \ I know this is basic, but we will be ramping up from here. Another way to think\
  \ about this is it's two degrees of freedom. If you want to know the area of something,\
  \ you need to know two numbers to define it entirely; you need length and width.\
  \ You could do that in various other ways, but this is a two-dimensional number.\
  \ Now you want to measure more, so you want to keep measuring something in a higher-dimensional\
  \ space. You've got length, you've got area\u2014area is length times width or something\
  \ like that. And now you want to also measure volume. With that, I have run out\
  \ of dimensions on the board; I can no longer ... Accurate representation of a two-dimensional\
  \ point XY: if I want to make a three-dimensional space, I no longer have enough\
  \ dimensions on this board because it is a two-dimensional object. So, we can fake\
  \ it and use a right-angle approach. Let's call this point back here Z and think\
  \ about how to represent it. We can go one unit in the X direction and two units\
  \ in the Y direction, and then one, two, three units in the Z direction. So, this\
  \ is XZ, and we can also paint that up. That's a little complicated, but it's fine;\
  \ you understand it: X, Y, Z. Great! This is a three-dimensional point; we've accomplished\
  \ that. That's great. This is how you can measure. If you're trying to categorize\
  \ objects according to their volume, you need three degrees of freedom. You need\
  \ three numbers to define that volume specifically, and you can represent that spatially\
  \ in this nice three-dimensional grid. Now, I don't want to belabor this point too\
  \ much because we'll get there gradually. So, this is three dimensions. Traditionally,\
  \ if you're going to touch engineering, this is the international symbol for three-dimensional\
  \ space: XYZ. This is the right-hand rule. It would be represented as XYZ. This\
  \ is a left-handed coordinate system, which is not valid. Don't do this due to the\
  \ established rules. Actually, there's more to discuss there, but we can skip past\
  \ it. In three dimensions, that's how many dimensions we have in space. In human\
  \ experience, we are very good at spatial estimates and quick calculations, such\
  \ as determining that a cup is in front of a bottle or that a cup is near the edge\
  \ of the table. These kinds of spatial computations are very easy for us. Now, there's\
  \ nothing special about three dimensions, except that those are the dimensions you\
  \ need to define space and time. However, you can extend this concept to define\
  \ something that requires more than three numbers. Again, I don't want to dwell\
  \ on this point too much, but I will say that it relates to the Pythagorean theorem\
  \ and how you measure distances. In one dimension, the distance from a point to\
  \ the origin is trivially defined. Sort of two. Pythagoras is the one that's A,\
  \ B, C, so A squared plus B squared equals C squared. So C equals the square root\
  \ of A squared plus B squared. This is how you calculate distance. You've all seen\
  \ this, I'm sure, at various points in your high school career. This is the particular\
  \ case of using the Pythagorean theorem in two dimensions. You replace A and B with\
  \ X and Y, and then you have a way to measure distance in two-dimensional space.\
  \ In one-dimensional space, it's very easy; the square root of 2 squared is just\
  \ 2, so that's straightforward. In two-dimensional space, to measure distance, you\
  \ just add a Z. The formula to measure distance in three-dimensional space is the\
  \ square root of X squared plus Y squared plus Z squared. You can keep going; there's\
  \ nothing special about two dimensions. You can add a W, you can add an L, you can\
  \ add an M, and just keep going. You lose the ability to plot it in a way that makes\
  \ sense, but you can keep doing the same math that you were doing with three dimensions\
  \ up to ten million dimensions.\n\nA lot of the AI stuff works this way; it uses\
  \ that same kind of spatial math, but it's applied in very high-dimensional spaces.\
  \ That's one of those terms you hear people say, like, \"high-dimensional mathematics,\"\
  \ and it sounds very complex, but it just means that you keep adding numbers to\
  \ the Pythagorean theorem to measure distance, and everything else is pretty much\
  \ the same. I will say too, there's a lot of general math concepts we'll cover here,\
  \ but luckily, you don't have to do any of the math yourself; you just have to understand\
  \ it, which is so much easier. I know there's a part where I mention, \"Oh look,\
  \ you can have two XY things,\" and that makes some intuitive sense. I need to assure\
  \ you that that intuitive gut check\u2014like, yeah, that makes rough sense\u2014\
  is the vast majority of what you actually need to know about mathematics. Being\
  \ able to do it on paper helps, but I firmly believe that being able to do the math\
  \ on paper is just an extra layer of understanding on top of the gut check intuitions\
  \ that will get you most of the way towards where you need to go. \n\nOkay, yeah.\
  \ So right now, let's simplify this and just go back down to two dimensions, because\
  \ it's easier. There we go, 2D. Great. So this is what we call these... Cartesian\
  \ coordinates are called that because Western science and math tends to name things\
  \ after the people who discover them, which can be quite annoying. The same people\
  \ often discover so many things that you end up replacing these words all the time,\
  \ and it's really frustrating. However, these coordinates are called Cartesian,\
  \ ostensibly named for Ren\xE9 Descartes. The story goes that he was a sickly guy\
  \ lying in bed watching a fly crawling on a window. He realized that he could define\
  \ the fly's position by looking at the intersection point between the fly and two\
  \ points on the windowsill. He then developed some formalisms, which allowed him\
  \ to name the concepts of a grid after himself. It's frustrating, but that's the\
  \ backstory. \n\nThis Cartesian space is typically defined by characteristics like\
  \ straight lines, grids, and squares. When you move from two dimensions to three\
  \ dimensions, you transition from a square to a cube, and so forth. You can also\
  \ define these types of constructs in angular coordinates. For instance, if I care\
  \ about a point in space, I can define it using straight line projections onto the\
  \ basis vector axes. I could also describe it as being this far away at a specific\
  \ angle off of zero degrees. \n\nI begin with what we can call X and then move up\
  \ at an angle, which can be in degrees, radians, or whatever you prefer. I project\
  \ out to a certain distance R and still reach the same point in two-dimensional\
  \ space. Instead of defining the point in terms of X and Y, I can also define it\
  \ in terms of theta and rho, where rho represents the distance or radius. If this\
  \ were a circle, it would be whatever that distance is. \n\nAgain, notice that this\
  \ is a two-dimensional point with two degrees of freedom. I can define it either\
  \ in linear XY coordinates or in angular theta-rho coordinates. You need two numbers\
  \ to define its position. Once you have that, if you transition from 2D to 3D, the\
  \ figures become spheres. \n\nThe important thing to understand is that you can\
  \ always switch back and forth between linear coordinate systems and spherical coordinate\
  \ systems, which we refer to as polar coordinates versus Cartesian coordinates.\
  \ In practice, when you're doing calculations, you'll often switch back and forth\
  \ depending on the specific mathematical context. For instance, when examining joint\
  \ angles, it's particularly helpful to look at things in terms of polar coordinates,\
  \ as they intrinsically involve angles. Guys, this distance we can just assume never\
  \ changes. Now, if I'm looking at something like joint angles, if I assume that\
  \ these are rigid bodies and that the radius doesn't change, then I only need one\
  \ number to define where it is and not two. This means I have one less number to\
  \ deal with, which is great because we already have too many numbers that don't\
  \ make sense. This might change tomorrow. \n\nLet's see, I\u2019m going to skip\
  \ some of this because it gets too mathy pretty quickly, and I think this will make\
  \ more sense once there's data to look at. By way of completeness, we've been talking\
  \ about ways of measuring space, and we should also discuss ways of measuring time.\
  \ You'll hear terms like spatiotemporal coordinates and spatiotemporal calibration.\
  \ Remember that's an old term. Spatiotemporal means we are considering both space\
  \ and time.\n\nWhen you're looking at data like this, it's very common to see it\
  \ presented in 2D plots. You often see that the x-axis represents time and the y-axis\
  \ represents some measurement over time. For instance, if the y-value is the height\
  \ of my hand off the ground, at time zero we measure it and it's one. So at time\
  \ zero, that's me at one. Then we wait, let's say, a second and measure it again;\
  \ now it's one and a half units off the ground at time one. If I keep moving my\
  \ hand up, it's going to keep going up, and if I were to draw this, you would see\
  \ the points plotted and connected, resulting in squiggles. This is called a time\
  \ series because it's a series of measurements over time. \n\nThis is a one-dimensional\
  \ measurement. I'm just measuring height and recording it once per time unit, which\
  \ could be in seconds. If it's a video, that could be 30 frames per second, so it's\
  \ once every 33 milliseconds. If it\u2019s a microphone that records at 44 kHz,\
  \ then it\u2019s once every one over 44,000 seconds. And that's how you get measurements\
  \ over time. The important thing to see is that you'll often see this presented\
  \ as a connected line, but that's not actually what you're measuring. You are only\
  \ ever going to be measuring something at time intervals. You'll be getting one\
  \ measurement per time interval, and this is what your data actually looks like.\
  \ We have to assume that the movement between the measured intervals is kind of\
  \ like what we expect it to be, and if we do that, then we can connect the lines\
  \ and get a nice time series. However, if this is one measurement every second,\
  \ and I'm doing this with my hand, then it actually doesn't look like that under\
  \ the hood. If these intervals are like one every millisecond, then we can trust\
  \ that. If it's one every second, I could just as easily be doing this with my hand,\
  \ and we only get these measurements every second. So if we interpolate, we're going\
  \ to be missing a lot of the story. That's time. I'll just say, just because it's\
  \ on the thing, that similar to space, time can also be thought of in two basic\
  \ forms: linear time, sort of like a stopwatch, and phasic time, which is like a\
  \ clock that resets to zero every cycle through the available values. That will\
  \ become important in the future. If you care about calculus, if this is the position,\
  \ the slope is the velocity because it's the change in position over time. If you\
  \ do that again, you get acceleration. So velocity is the derivative of position,\
  \ and acceleration is the derivative of velocity. If you go back with the integrals,\
  \ that's all the calculus you ever need to know as far as I'm concerned. So that's\
  \ measurement. We've been talking about these measurements in terms of these abstract\
  \ units, like singular sticks, but it doesn't really matter. The same sort of methods\
  \ of plotting will work no matter what units you're measuring with. For measuring\
  \ distance, we might use meters; for measuring temperature, we might use Celsius\
  \ or Kelvin; and for measuring weight, we might use kilograms. The same sort of\
  \ plotting representations will work throughout. Now, this is a practical thing\
  \ that you should keep in mind and will come up at some point in your future. When\
  \ we're talking about the sciences, there are rules about the units that we're allowed\
  \ to use. Here in America, we have things like imperial units for... Feet and inches\
  \ are often discussed as worthless measurements, and there's a strong argument for\
  \ that. However, the reality is that many of our Imperial measurements are based\
  \ on easily factorable numbers like 12 and 16, which makes calculations simpler\
  \ in a home environment. In contrast, the metric system is based on 10, which is\
  \ excellent for decimal points and precision, but it's more challenging to divide\
  \ evenly. With 10, you can only factor into 2 and 5, while with 12, you can factor\
  \ into 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.\n\nIf you imagine yourself as a vendor in a medieval\
  \ town needing to measure out various goods, it\u2019s easier to use weights in\
  \ increments of 12 and 16. This is particularly relevant for activities like baking,\
  \ where it's simple to cut ingredients in half or into thirds.\n\nIn scientific\
  \ contexts, we are required to use SI units, which are standardized measurements\
  \ established by international conventions. SI units stand for Systeme International,\
  \ a French term meaning International Standard. A set number of base SI units exists,\
  \ including seconds for time, meters for length, kilograms for mass, amperes for\
  \ electrical current, Kelvin for thermodynamic temperature, moles for the amount\
  \ of substance, and Candela for luminous intensity.\n\nFor the most part, we will\
  \ be focusing on these units: seconds, meters, and kilograms. Now let's move to\
  \ our first visual aid. One of the interesting aspects of the metric system is the\
  \ compatibility of its components. If this were one meter, and if this were one\
  \ liter, which it claims to be, we could use these measurements to recreate most\
  \ of the metric system. \n\nA liter is defined as one thousand milliliters, and\
  \ a milliliter is equivalent to a cubic centimeter of water. A cubic centimeter\
  \ of water weighs one gram. So, if you take a centimeter, create a cube of that\
  \ dimension, fill it with water, and measure its weight, that weight is defined\
  \ as one gram. It is defined that one cubic centimeter of water weighs one gram.\
  \ If you get a thousand of those together, it would weigh one kilogram. Therefore,\
  \ a thousand cubic centimeters of water would equal one liter, and one liter weighs\
  \ one kilogram. So there's a fun sort of correspondence where if you know how long\
  \ a meter is and you have standardized water, you can recreate a lot of the units\
  \ that we end up using. \n\nTraditionally, the meter stick was measured as this\
  \ physical stick in France. There used to be an actual stick like this, but it has\
  \ rusted away over time, so now it just represents some markings on a stone. We\
  \ have since moved away from this method of determining a meter and now measure\
  \ it in relation to the distance that light travels. I can't remember exactly how\
  \ we used to define seconds, but it involved the period of a pendulum of a given\
  \ length. Now, we measure seconds in terms of the oscillation of a cesium atom,\
  \ as they oscillate at a very regular interval. We measure meters by the distance\
  \ that light travels in a specific number of oscillations of a cesium atom. This\
  \ measurement was designed to be the time it takes for light to travel that distance,\
  \ allowing us to be more precise with our modern measurements.\n\nThese are the\
  \ only base units we have for conducting proper science. So, if you're ever doing\
  \ a scientific study or measurement or need to report numbers, you're not allowed\
  \ to use inches; you must use meters. You may choose to use centimeters, millimeters,\
  \ kilometers, or whatever unit makes sense for your measurement, but you cannot\
  \ use inches or feet. Similarly, for measuring mass, you cannot use pounds; you\
  \ must use kilograms. When I say 'allowed,' I mean that the scientific community\
  \ has agreed on these standards. If you're publishing a paper in a scientific journal,\
  \ then you must adhere to these conventions. If you present information using non-SI\
  \ units, such as feet and pounds, they should return it to you and request that\
  \ you convert it to SI units. If they do not, I would consider that a failure of\
  \ the peer review process, which is a separate conversation. Now, let's notice that\
  \ this rather constrained list of possible units begs the question: why is it so\
  \ limited? Why are these the numbers we have? The answer is that if you drill down\
  \ into it, these are what we consider to be the short list of measurable things.\
  \ Everything we can measure with our basic tools can boil down to either these basic\
  \ quantities or derive more complicated combinations of these quantities. We have\
  \ time, spatial extent, mass, electrical current, temperature measured in Kelvin\u2014\
  where zero is Absolute Zero\u2014moles as a countable amount, and candela as a measure\
  \ of light. \n\nWhen we talk about transduction and the environmental energies that\
  \ the nervous system takes in to help us perceive the world, we can think in a roundabout\
  \ way about sensory systems. If you're thinking about the energy they absorb to\
  \ provide an empirical estimate of what exists in the world, consider how sight,\
  \ sound, touch, and taste relate back to these basic units. You will also quickly\
  \ realize that if you're trying to measure anything of interest, these basic units\
  \ may not be adequate for very long. You will eventually need to develop new units\
  \ to measure more complex or interesting phenomena. \n\nFor example, if you want\
  \ to measure something like velocity\u2014that is, how fast something is moving\
  \ through the world\u2014you cannot use only these basic units. Instead, you need\
  \ to combine some of them. Velocity can be measured in meters per second, which\
  \ means every time a second passes, you move this many meters. Therefore, the SI\
  \ units for velocity are meters per second. If you are moving slowly, you might\
  \ use millimeters per second, and if you're moving quickly, kilometers per second,\
  \ but it will still relate back to these SI units. Getting towards neuroscience,\
  \ we are rapidly approaching the topic of this course, which I probably should have\
  \ specified beforehand. One of the main nodules of interest in this class is biomechanics.\
  \ A lot of you have asked about biomechanics, like what does that mean? Conversations\
  \ about biomechanics are, roughly speaking, good old-fashioned Newtonian physics,\
  \ except as it applies to a wobbly biological system, typically one that has something\
  \ like a muscular-skeletal system. \n\nWe will soon be getting to the biomechanics,\
  \ and next week the data we will be collecting in class will involve standing balance.\
  \ For example, look at this wacky thing that I'm doing with my body. I'm carrying\
  \ the majority of my mass, roughly 100 kilograms of salty meat, like a meter and\
  \ a half above the ground, which is an insane thing to do. I can hold this position\
  \ and even go onto one foot. This involves a lot of mass being supported on a couple\
  \ of wiggly joints and variable stiffness electric strings called muscles, all while\
  \ having a base of support that is quite small. If I had come in here with 200 kilograms\
  \ of steel and placed it on something as small as this, raising it to this height\
  \ would be very dangerous. However, this is something we do with our bodies. A healthy\
  \ person will do it a million times per year. \n\nIf you take 10,000 steps a day,\
  \ let's say 20,000 steps a day because you're graduate students and you walk a lot,\
  \ 20,000 times 365 approaches a million steps per year. That is a period during\
  \ which the large mass of your body is being supported above the ground, thanks\
  \ to your nervous system electrifying and firing your muscles in the right way at\
  \ the appropriate intervals to keep you from falling over. This is one of those\
  \ things that we don't really think about, but once you start thinking about it,\
  \ there's a lot going on. My particular approach to studying this involves boiling\
  \ it down to first principles, measuring the behavior in those basic units of geometry\
  \ and physics, and then trying to figure out what we can infer about the unmeasurable\
  \ parts of the system, which are the neural firings based on the physics and geometry\
  \ of the measurable components, like where my body is at any given point in space.\
  \ So, when we talk about biomechanics, we are talking about... The physics of biophysics,\
  \ as applied to organisms in biology, involves units that we refer to in terms of\
  \ position, which indicates where I am in space, and velocity, which describes how\
  \ I am moving in space. Then we start to get into more complex terms like force,\
  \ which pertains to the forces I am applying to the world. For example, if I am\
  \ standing right here and I push with my toes, I will tilt backwards. If I push\
  \ off the table, I will go that way. Thus, I am applying forces into the world.\
  \ Because I am a massive object putting force into the world, this will cause me\
  \ to move. \n\nThe units for force are Newtons, defined as kilograms times meters\
  \ per second squared. So, it's kilogram times meters per second squared, or kilogram\
  \ m/s\xB2. If you remember, we have the following units: position is in meters,\
  \ velocity is in meters per second, which tells us how much our position changes\
  \ in meters in one second, and acceleration is in meters per second per second,\
  \ indicating how much faster we are going one second from now compared to right\
  \ now. \n\nIf we jump ahead to Newton's Laws, we know that force equals mass times\
  \ acceleration. We've all heard this before. I will leave this as an exercise for\
  \ the reader: if you take the concept of force, which equals mass (in kilograms)\
  \ times acceleration (in meters per second squared), you will derive the unit we\
  \ call Newtons. \n\nAdditionally, if we apply a force over a given distance, we\
  \ refer to this as work. Work is calculated as force applied over distance, yielding\
  \ units of kilograms times meters squared times seconds squared, which is referred\
  \ to as a joule. A joule is a unit of energy, and energy is defined as the ability\
  \ to do work, which is conserved. \n\nFor example, in the famous equation E=mc\xB2\
  , if you analyze the units, you will find that energy (E) is equal to mass (m) in\
  \ kilograms times c, which is the speed of light in meters per second, squared.\
  \ This will lead you to one of these conclusions. Therefore, this discussion illustrates\
  \ how these concepts are boiled down to SI units. Now that we've gotten to energy,\
  \ we're touching on some classic physics concepts, specifically the conservation\
  \ of energy. This turns out to be a fundamental law of physics: in a closed system,\
  \ energy is neither created nor destroyed; it simply changes form. This is a strong\
  \ belief I hold, and physics has consistently affirmed that conservation of energy\
  \ is generally true. Therefore, this is a solid assumption I can utilize as a scientist\
  \ to make sense of the complex data we'll measure when we start examining the intricate\
  \ movements of a person in space. This data might not always make sense right away,\
  \ but we will discover this together as a group.\n\nWe can also discuss normalized\
  \ units. I will touch on this briefly. While we use SI units for mass\u2014such\
  \ as kilograms\u2014when measuring a person moving through space, we may find measuring\
  \ everything in kilograms somewhat cumbersome. For instance, you might say, \"I\
  \ weigh 100 kilograms,\" or something similar. This can get tedious, especially\
  \ since we are focusing on studying a person.\n\nTo simplify our calculations, we\
  \ can normalize our mass measurements by dividing by my personal body weight, or\
  \ my mass in kilograms. By doing this, we no longer have to use kilograms directly;\
  \ instead, we can discuss body masses or weights. Although, it's important to note\
  \ that weight is actually a measure of force, not mass. So, we normalize mass by\
  \ the participant's body mass, which gives us a unit of one. This is a very convenient\
  \ unit, as it simplifies the math significantly. \n\nNow, as we progress, we are\
  \ inching closer to conceptualizing a human as one of these approximations. This\
  \ is still quite complex, but we'll stick with this concept for now. We've gotten\
  \ through all that spatial stuff, all that measurement stuff, and all that unit\
  \ stuff. Now we can start thinking in terms of physics. Physics is essentially the\
  \ math that describes how objects move through the world. There are all sorts of\
  \ different layers of physics, and the layer that I tend to focus on is what's called\
  \ classical mechanics. Classical mechanics is basically Newton's three laws as they\
  \ apply to simple mechanical objects, so it's essentially Cannonball physics. \n\
  \nThis is also a fun example of a philosophy of science concept, which is that all\
  \ of our theories are wrong at every point in time. Newton's laws came about, I\
  \ want to say, in the 1700s or something like that. He was trying to understand\
  \ the motion of the planets, and he came up with these simple rules of how mechanics\
  \ tend to work. It was very useful and explained a lot about the physical world,\
  \ as well as how to derive the trajectories of simple objects through space using\
  \ Newtonian mechanics. It explains the majority of planetary motions, but it doesn't\
  \ do a great job of predicting the movement of the planet Mercury. \n\nIn fact,\
  \ even back in that day, if they applied the Newtonian predictions for planetary\
  \ trajectories, Mercury's orbit didn't align with the predictions. They actually\
  \ postulated for a long time that there was another planet between Mercury and Venus\
  \ that could account for the weird anomalies in Mercury's orbit, and that planet\
  \ was called Vulcan, which is where that term comes from. \n\nEventually, time passed,\
  \ and a guy named Einstein entered the picture and started introducing all these\
  \ wacky ideas around relativity theory. It's much harder math, but if you apply\
  \ that theoretical framework to the motions of the planets and account for the fact\
  \ that the sun is so massive that it warps space-time, now Mercury's orbit starts\
  \ to make sense. There's no longer a need to posit the existence of some unknown,\
  \ undiscovered planet called Vulcan. We know from measurements that Newton's laws\
  \ of mechanics are not an accurate representation of the physical universe we inhabit.\
  \ We also know that in any location that we... Tend to care about as human beings\
  \ on this planet, the accuracy that you get when you use Newton's Laws is like nine\
  \ digits, it's like nine decimal places out. So, you start like the difference between\
  \ the prediction of this ball's motion in Newtonian mechanics and the same prediction\
  \ in relativistic mechanics is so far below our ability to measure the position.\
  \ You only really use relativity when you start looking at things like planets on\
  \ the scales of stars and stuff like that. So, we still use Newtonian mechanics\
  \ for almost everything that we do in our daily lives, even though we know that\
  \ it is not as accurate as something like relativistic physics. There's a lot to\
  \ be said there, but let's keep moving. So, yeah, Newton's Laws\u2014there are three\
  \ of them. The first law states that a body at rest or in motion tends to stay at\
  \ rest or in motion. That's inertia; things in motion tend to stay in motion unless\
  \ acted upon by a force. The second one, arguably my favorite, is force equals mass\
  \ times acceleration. Or if you're in rotational space, it's torque equals moment\
  \ of inertia times angular acceleration, but don't worry about that. So, force equals\
  \ mass times acceleration is a very, very useful equation. Basically, if you look\
  \ at me, I am a mass. My mass is not changing, so let's ignore the M of that because\
  \ it's not doing anything; it's a constant. So, let's divide by my body weight,\
  \ and then we have force equals acceleration. So, I'm not moving, I'm not accelerating.\
  \ That means that the sum of forces acting on my body has to equal zero. If it didn't,\
  \ I would be moving. Now, I'm going to... all the positives and the negatives have\
  \ to add up to zero in order for that to work. And you can see if I, I like soften\
  \ my... oh, let me do this backwards. The third law is, for every action there is\
  \ an equal and opposite reaction. You have an action and a reaction force. So, here\
  \ I am standing\u2014look, we're officially doing neuroscience. That's me, I'm standing,\
  \ and I'm standing on the ground, and I weigh one body mass, and I am being pulled\
  \ down by this horrible planet at a rate of G. If you drop me from a place up high,\
  \ I would accelerate downward at 9.8 meters per second squared; let's call it 10.\
  \ And that's always happening. At all times, this force, G, equals 9.8 m/s squared.\
  \ So that's the acceleration, and using the equation F equals ma, I am being pulled\
  \ down by that amount. However, I'm not moving, so there must be something else\
  \ pushing back with exactly the same force, and that's our good friend the ground.\
  \ The ground is a very useful object; it allows us to complete most of our goals.\
  \ As I push down, this is the action\u2014I'm pushing into the ground with mass\
  \ times gravity force, and the ground is dutifully pushing back with exactly negative\
  \ mass times gravity force. Great! If I ever decide to break this equation, I can\
  \ push. If I decide to push off the ground with more force than gravity is pulling\
  \ me down, then I can do something as wacky as jump. So, I apply force into the\
  \ ground, and if that force is greater than my weight, I become briefly airborne,\
  \ and then gravity pulls me back down. That winds up being important for a lot of\
  \ things.\n\nOkay, I need to speed up here. I think I know how this is going to\
  \ go. So, this is a preview of high-level human movement neuroscience, but we need\
  \ to do a little more work before we can dive into the meat of it. Let's go back\
  \ to thinking about simple spheroids, such as brightly colored juggling balls. When\
  \ you're doing empirical studies and measurements, you always have to make assumptions;\
  \ that's always going to be a thing you do. You have to assume that your senses\
  \ aren't lying to you at all times. You also make assumptions that the authors of\
  \ the papers you read are not actively lying to you and falsifying all their data.\
  \ Each time you make an assumption, you gain a little more predictive power. So,\
  \ if I'm trying to measure my body moving through space, I know that this is...\
  \ like a wobbly, meaty thing. I know that the distance between my elbow and my wrist\
  \ changes ever so slightly because I am made of squishy meat. However, if I assume\
  \ that this is not happening and that I am actually composed of rigid bodies that\
  \ do not change length, my math becomes significantly easier. I no longer have to\
  \ measure the length between these points; I only have to measure the angles between\
  \ them. The only measurement that can be made without making assumptions is that\
  \ you are having a conscious experience at this exact moment, which is not particularly\
  \ useful.\n\nThis brings us back to the earlier discussion about the idea of conservation\
  \ of energy. It is one of those very powerful and useful assumptions that can help\
  \ us progress toward understanding the things we care about in our research objectives.\
  \ For instance, if my goal is to understand something like standing posture or,\
  \ God forbid, locomotion, there are many aspects of that question that I cannot\
  \ measure empirically. I simply do not have the technological capacity to measure\
  \ the firing in my cerebellum or the stretch forces in my muscles. However, I can\
  \ measure things like the stick figure position of my body 33 times per second using\
  \ a motion capture system that I built over time at home.\n\nBy utilizing what I\
  \ can measure and making certain assumptions about conservation of energy, I can\
  \ begin to understand what we will refer to as the 'fiddly bits.' This concept will\
  \ be further explored next week. For now, I want to cover as much material as possible\
  \ so that you will have experienced it at least once.\n\nWhen performing a mechanical\
  \ analysis of a person, you need to consider what forms of energy are relevant to\
  \ the task at hand. In this part of the class, we are focused on measuring movement\
  \ and the motor control aspect; we are not examining perception or vision. Therefore,\
  \ we can ignore factors such as light and concentrate on the essential physics of\
  \ being a massive object in a world that includes ground and gravity. The forms\
  \ of energy that we can measure and care about the most are primarily... Potential\
  \ energy and kinetic energy have various forms. The most obvious and easy one is\
  \ gravitational potential energy, which is related to height. We can consider the\
  \ ground to be at zero height; the horizontal position does not matter, but the\
  \ vertical position does. Gravitational potential energy is calculated as mass multiplied\
  \ by gravity and height. Here, mass is measured in kilograms, gravity in meters\
  \ per second squared, and height is measured in meters. When you do the math, you\
  \ will find that the units will be in Newtons. Essentially, potential energy measures\
  \ the force that an object would exert if dropped onto a scale. \n\nOther forms\
  \ of potential energy, which we won't focus on as much, include spring potential\
  \ energy, related to the stretchiness of springs, and chemical potential energy,\
  \ such as that found in food, bombs, gasoline, and other sources. In deeper levels\
  \ of biology, we will delve more into chemical potential energy, which is involved\
  \ in ionic charge mismatches. This relates to the concept of low energy states;\
  \ for instance, if an object is held above the ground, its low energy state is at\
  \ rest on the ground. When released, we can determine the energy upon impact.\n\n\
  Now, let's consider kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion. The formula for\
  \ kinetic energy is one-half times mass times velocity squared, represented as 1/2\
  \ MV\xB2. Here, mass is again in kilograms and velocity in meters per second. The\
  \ result will also be in Newtons because it measures force. Kinetic energy represents\
  \ the amount of force that would be experienced at the precise moment before an\
  \ object hits the ground. The kinetic energy at this moment will equal the amount\
  \ of gravitational potential energy the object had before it was dropped. When these\
  \ two energies are combined, they account for the energy transformations taking\
  \ place as the object moves from a height to the ground. Using that type of analysis,\
  \ potential and kinetic energy explain phenomena such as the parabolic flight of\
  \ an object through space. As it leaves my hand, it possesses an instantaneous moment\
  \ of energy at the moment it breaks contact with my hand. In free flight, it has\
  \ a certain amount of kinetic energy, which is the maximum energy it will have during\
  \ its entire trajectory. At this point, it has maximum kinetic energy and minimum\
  \ potential energy. As it moves upward through space, its kinetic energy slows down,\
  \ and as it gets higher, the potential energy increases until it reaches the apex.\
  \ At this point, the potential energy is at its maximum because it is as high as\
  \ it will get, while the kinetic energy is at a minimum, briefly reaching zero velocity\
  \ as it transitions from rising to falling. When it comes back down and reaches\
  \ the exact moment it hits the ground, it will have the same amount of kinetic energy\
  \ as it had when it started. This creates a nice trade-off between kinetic and potential\
  \ energy. \n\nWhen I talk about concepts like transduction for vision, action, or\
  \ somatosensation, we are discussing the transfer of energy from one form, such\
  \ as light measured in candelas, into another form, which is a pattern of neural\
  \ activity that can be measured by voltages and ion mismatches. There is much that\
  \ remains unmeasurable in that conversion. However, physics suggests that if we\
  \ could tally up every ion and every quantum of energy, the mathematics of that\
  \ conversion would work out as perfectly as the physics of simple ballistic motion.\
  \ The transition between kinetic and potential energy is also a form of transduction,\
  \ representing a transfer of energy from one form to another.\n\nIf I were a bird,\
  \ I could flap my wings and push against the air sufficiently to generate a reaction\
  \ force that counteracts gravity. If I were using a pogo stick and compressed it\
  \ before releasing it, it would contain spring potential energy that would allow\
  \ it to bounce upon hitting the ground. Assuming a simple rigid body scenario, the\
  \ kinetic and potential energy would demonstrate this nice conservative trade-off,\
  \ which will become important later. Now we get to my favorite part, which I will\
  \ only touch on briefly. Next time, we will discuss this at length. This is the\
  \ concept of the center of mass. The center of mass is a term in physics you have\
  \ probably heard of; it comes up a lot in sports, especially anything related to\
  \ gymnastics and balance. You hear people talk about the center of mass as the position\
  \ of your body.\n\nThe center of mass is the average position of all the components\
  \ of a larger object. For instance, if I were to take this tube and cut it into\
  \ one-centimeter long sections, then take the position of those sections relative\
  \ to a zero point and calculate the average, it would be in the middle of the tube.\
  \ That is the center of mass. When you are supporting something above the ground,\
  \ you support the center of mass of the object. If I were to hold it over here,\
  \ then the center of mass would fall, and it wouldn't stay on my hand.\n\nFor example,\
  \ I have these ankle weights that I found on the street near my house. There is\
  \ a place in the neighborhood where people leave things they no longer need. I found\
  \ these weights, and they are somewhat useful for this demonstration. They weigh\
  \ about a pound, which is roughly half a kilogram. Before I added the weights, the\
  \ tube had uniform density, so the center of mass was in the middle. Now that it\
  \ is not of uniform density, the center of mass shifts to this new position.\n\n\
  Now, the center of mass of the entire system takes into account the shift and density\
  \ of all components involved. If we wanted to, we could determine how much this\
  \ system weighs by measuring the distance between the balance point and the center\
  \ of the tube, which is where we would balance it if it were symmetrically oriented.\
  \ However, I do not want to proceed with that right now. Could you see the concept\
  \ of balance as the relationship between the center of mass and the base of support?\
  \ This is something we're going to discuss a lot. Similarly, we talked a little\
  \ about reductionist approaches to scientific studies, which involves trying to\
  \ nail down the problem. I mentioned before that I want to measure something I care\
  \ about, but I don't have the ability to measure all the parts of it with the precision\
  \ I need. One approach to dealing with this problem is to narrow your focus. Instead\
  \ of trying to explain the entire complexity of the moving object, which is not\
  \ available for empirical measurement, you can look at a smaller piece of it. For\
  \ example, instead of examining the entire body, you might look at just the movement\
  \ of a single joint or a single arm. You can maintain a high level of fidelity by\
  \ considering this shape in terms of a thing that has all these joint angles that\
  \ can define its position at a given point in time. However, even for something\
  \ like this, which is a massive simplification of a human, it's still a complex\
  \ object physically speaking. There are still a lot of joints that can vary, and\
  \ the number of degrees of freedom you have is equal to the number of joints multiplied\
  \ by two or three, depending on how you count. To define the position of this kinematic\
  \ object in space requires many different numbers, which can be challenging to deal\
  \ with. The other approach is to simplify the system you're looking at into a significant\
  \ oversimplification and try to do so in a way that still allows you to make meaningful\
  \ statements about the system as a whole. This is essentially what the idea of the\
  \ center of mass is. Rather than thinking about this whole complex thing with all\
  \ the joints, muscles, blood pumping, and the biological realities involved, we\
  \ can condense it down into a simplified system. This is something I created some\
  \ years ago, and it shows a guy doing a handstand\u2014a French parkour artist named\
  \ Simonster. The X here is... The full body center of mass is measured as the weighted\
  \ sum of each of the body segments, such as the forearm, the upper arm, the head,\
  \ the chest, and the legs. You take the average of all those positions, weighted\
  \ by the mass of the specific segment. For example, the forearm weighs considerably\
  \ less than the legs. This gives you the center of mass position. Then, if you measure\
  \ the limits of the base of support here, it is the distance between the tips of\
  \ the fingers and the heel of the hand, which are the points where you can exert\
  \ force into the ground. The center of mass always stays within that space. You\
  \ can understand that even though there are many biological factors involved, from\
  \ a physics perspective, you can define the task of balance using very simplified\
  \ models of the body. This reduction takes the entire complexity of a human being\
  \ and boils it down to a singular point mass, which can represent two dimensions\
  \ or even three dimensions. We have simplified the world to a place that feels more\
  \ manageable. I am capable of handling a certain number of numbers, but not too\
  \ many. By the way, on the list in the notes, if you click on the link, it takes\
  \ you to various animations that I created. We will discuss those more later. You\
  \ can reduce this complex object of a human down to a singular point mass. Physics\
  \ indicates that what is said about the center of mass of a system is to some extent\
  \ true for all the objects in that system; this might be related to the finite element\
  \ theorem, but I am not entirely sure about that. Essentially, discussing the center\
  \ of mass of a person is a valid approximation of the full picture that would emerge\
  \ if we measured every single part of their body simultaneously. However, it is\
  \ clear that you would lose a lot of information. For instance, if I am reducing\
  \ this entire person's body to that singular mass, I can no longer accurately comment\
  \ on joint angles or the forces at the elbow, but I can determine whether or not\
  \ they are in a stable or unstable regime. Regime, and I can measure things like\
  \ what's happening at the physics level when he shifts his hand from one position\
  \ to the other. I can use this belief about the physics of his body to start trying\
  \ to infer what some of these wiggles and movements actually mean. For example,\
  \ without this sort of center of mass analysis, it might be hard to explain why\
  \ his arm is out here; there might not be much to say about that. But when you're\
  \ thinking about it like this, it becomes very easy. He sticks his arm out so that\
  \ his center of mass... if I move my arm and leg like this, the average of them\
  \ keeps my body over my foot. I can do this, but I can't do that. Anyway, you'll\
  \ figure it out. I'll show you visual representations of this once you actually\
  \ get the numbers next week. Right. And then, you might ask the question: how do\
  \ we do these measurements? How do we get these numbers? And how do I know where\
  \ to draw the segment center of mass for his torso? For example, what percentage\
  \ of body weight is a forearm? How do you get those numbers? Well, it turns out\
  \ we just have these lookup tables; this is called anthropometry. These are just\
  \ statistics. Ah, wrong way. Right. These particular lookup tables come from a guy\
  \ named David Winter. This is copied from a textbook of his from like 1995 or something\
  \ like that, and it shows these measurements of the shoulder as 0.129H, where H\
  \ is the body height. Then, these are the lookup tables for these segments. The\
  \ forearm is defined as the distance between the elbow axis and the styloid, I guess,\
  \ that's here. It's 0.28 of body mass, and the center of mass is 4.36% of the weight\
  \ from the proximal joint, which is the one towards the middle, to the distal joint,\
  \ which is the one that's farther away. If you add these two numbers up, they equal\
  \ one. You can use these numbers to calculate these values. These numbers were basically\
  \ statistics from a study where researchers analyzed various cadavers, primarily\
  \ from older men. I believe it was part of Air Force research. There are now newer\
  \ tables that include people of different ages and genders, but ultimately it doesn't\
  \ greatly affect the outcome for many of the numbers. For instance, women typically\
  \ have a lower center of mass. However, for the levels of analysis we\u2019re dealing\
  \ with in terms of physics\u2014like where your body mass is concentrated while\
  \ you're moving your feet\u2014the differences in estimates across various demographics\
  \ of humans are often negligible. They fall below the precision level of our measurements\
  \ in most cases. Therefore, I tend to use these older statistics because they are\
  \ readily available. If you look up papers on anthropometry tables, you'll find\
  \ all kinds of new research about athletes versus non-athletes and variations with\
  \ age. Great work to them! \n\nOkay, pendulums are my favorite topic; we'll talk\
  \ about them next week, along with balance. Also, this is color; there we go. Someday,\
  \ we'll also discuss projective geometry, which relates to how cameras and vision\
  \ work. The math involved is the same, only this focuses on light instead of physics.\
  \ It's all about projecting images, and then there\u2019s the role of eyeballs and\
  \ visual perception.\n\nThat was a lot of information! I hope you found it valuable.\
  \ Just to be clear, this information will not be on the test; there is no test.\
  \ The goal here is to internalize and conceptualize the material. It's more beneficial\
  \ to think about how you would explain this story to someone else rather than trying\
  \ to remember every specific detail of what I said. Notice that a lot of it was\
  \ reconstructed from first principles, so it's useful to be able to do that. Try\
  \ to relay this story to someone else. You know, later when you hit parts, it\u2019\
  s like, wait, how did you get from there to there? Think about it, ask those questions.\
  \ Okay, cool. Thank you. We'll talk more about this next week, and we'll talk about\
  \ pendula, which are the best. Pendulums are my favorite, so we\u2019ll talk all\
  \ about it. Okay, bye."

    me three years ago if that was data, I would have said, "Yeah, I guess technically,"
    but it''s only since AI came online that I think of that as data. Freeo Cap is
    a motion capture, sort of a free open-source project that I''ve been building
    for the past half-decade or so of my life. It is specifically designed to create
    good classroom demos and things like that. So we''re going to be recording some
    data and then talking about it in the context of the kinds of concepts we''re
    going to cover today. Hopefully, we can get some of that in today.


    Let''s see, is there anything else to catch up on? Just for completeness, I will
    remind everybody although nothing special has happened with this round, in the
    server, in the links and resources, find the server scrape checkpoint. At the
    bottom, there is the same sort of 127. That''s the server scraped and analyzed
    as of this morning. So the same thing, download it, unzip it; if you don''t know
    what unzipping is, it''s the action where you double-click and it makes a folder
    next door that you can open like a regular file. You can search for your name
    in there.


    I will be refactoring the way we do the student profile-building process, so your
    individual profiles are going to change probably next week. This change is because
    I realized that it would give you a much more precise measurement of your interests
    if I didn''t use everything you put in the server for the profile but just the
    assignment chats, the ones from your intro and the poster presentation. Additionally,
    I''m in the process of setting something up that will allow you to ask the bot
    to remember you in a given chat, and it will pull that history into the conversation.
    This way, you won''t have to start every conversation from scratch.


    Also, just as a reminder for helping you learn the paths and whatnot, here we
    are on the server. In the same channel up here, links and resources and course
    repository, click on that and something pops up. I don''t know why two things
    pop up. This is the course repository, which is the most up-to-date. Oh, actually,
    I forgot to update the syllabus last time. Syllabus commit in sync. Yes, thank
    you. Don''t break.'

    \ much more specific about once you actually start to get into the business of\
    \ knowledge generation. The idea, as a scientist, is that you are attempting to\
    \ create new knowledge for humankind, which is a very difficult thing to do. It's\
    \ hard to know stuff, and there are certain rules for how to do that. \n\nA lot\
    \ of what we talk about in the sciences, the empirical sciences, is based on the\
    \ concept of empirical measurement. There are many ways to know things. The scientific\
    \ method and empirical method is one way to know the world; it's a very powerful\
    \ way to understand it because it allows you to do things like make predictions\
    \ about the future, build tools, and heal people when they're sick. Everything\
    \ in that conception of knowledge is based, at some level, on an empirical measurement\
    \ of the world. \n\nEmpirical measurement is something we will talk a bit about,\
    \ but basically, it's the idea that you have done some kind of measurement. That\
    \ term, measurement, is one of those terms that often gets taken for granted.\
    \ One important thing to remember when you're considering empirical research and\
    \ the concept of measurement is that everything you are doing, everything you\
    \ are building on, has to be built relative to something else. \n\nIf you're trying\
    \ to generate new knowledge, that knowledge will be based on other things, like\
    \ the term \u201Ctruth preserving,\u201D which is very important in the philosophy\
    \ of science. This concept allows you to build from one thing that you know to\
    \ another thing that you might know. Everything you think you know about the world\
    \ is based on some kind of background reasoning: \"I think this because I learned\
    \ that; I believe this because of all that kind of stuff.\" \n\nSo, it's helpful\
    \ when you are learning the concepts of measurement to try to recreate those epistemological\

    \ believe the things that you believe. You are not allowed to just believe things\
    \ for no reason. Everything that you consider has to be examined closely, and\
    \ you need to try to understand what it is connected to. Given that, it is reasonable\
    \ to ask about origins and the classical philosophical bedrock of belief. We tend\
    \ to ascribe this concept to Descartes, who was operating in the 1500s. You may\
    \ have heard of his Cartesian coordinates and various other things that we will\
    \ talk about at different points in time. He was engaged in a philosophical inquiry,\
    \ attempting to understand what his knowledge of the world was based on, and he\
    \ came across a wonderful little phrase called \"Cogito, ergo sum,\" which means\
    \ \"I think, therefore I am.\" This is essentially a fancy way of stating that\
    \ if you drill down to the core, the only thing you can actually know and believe\
    \ without referencing any other kind of knowledge is that you are experiencing\
    \ consciousness in this very moment. You are having a qualitative state; you are\
    \ thinking, and nothing in the universe can fake the experience of having a conscious\
    \ experience right now. Your memories of yesterday could be deceitful; you might\
    \ have been under the influence of hallucinogenics or someone could have been\

    \ with that. Yes, I can doubt that there is a cup in front of me right now, but\
    \ if I keep looking and it keeps happening, and I keep moving and it has the sort\
    \ of geometrically reasonable deformations, then I reach out, and I have a cup\

    \ Let's pretend that this stick is one meter long, even though it's actually slightly\

    \ a one-dimensional object. Let's say this is infinitely long, and we've measured\
    \ this to be one stick long. So, there you go, one stick long. Then I can measure\
    \ two sticks, three sticks, etc. That's way better. So now, if I'm going around\
    \ measuring things, I can keep track of the length of the thing. But again, this\
    \ is not particularly exciting. There's not really a point in drawing that; you\
    \ just write down the number. You don't gain anything by looking at that number\
    \ relative to zero, other than just the knowledge of how numbers work. So, we're\
    \ going to call that X. We're also going to call that length. Great! So now we\
    \ want to measure things. This is good for measuring things like string or distances\
    \ from here to your house or the height of a person. But now we want to measure\
    \ different things. We're still doing stuff in length and distances, and now we're\
    \ going to split and have a second dimension that we'll call Y. We'll also call\
    \ that height, and it uses the same unit. So, you can still be one stick tall\
    \ or two sticks tall, things like that. Now you can measure things like boards,\
    \ desks, and floors. If you measure something that is two units long and one unit\

    \ about this is it's two degrees of freedom. If you want to know the area of something,\
    \ you need to know two numbers to define it entirely; you need length and width.\
    \ You could do that in various other ways, but this is a two-dimensional number.\
    \ Now you want to measure more, so you want to keep measuring something in a higher-dimensional\
    \ space. You've got length, you've got area\u2014area is length times width or\

    a three-dimensional space, I no longer have enough dimensions on this board because
    it is a two-dimensional object. So, we can fake it and use a right-angle approach.
    Let''s call this point back here Z and think about how to represent it. We can
    go one unit in the X direction and two units in the Y direction, and then one,
    two, three units in the Z direction. So, this is XZ, and we can also paint that
    up. That''s a little complicated, but it''s fine; you understand it: X, Y, Z.
    Great! This is a three-dimensional point; we''ve accomplished that. That''s great.
    This is how you can measure. If you''re trying to categorize objects according
    to their volume, you need three degrees of freedom. You need three numbers to
    define that volume specifically, and you can represent that spatially in this
    nice three-dimensional grid. Now, I don''t want to belabor this point too much
    because we''ll get there gradually. So, this is three dimensions. Traditionally,
    if you''re going to touch engineering, this is the international symbol for three-dimensional
    space: XYZ. This is the right-hand rule. It would be represented as XYZ. This
    is a left-handed coordinate system, which is not valid. Don''t do this due to
    the established rules. Actually, there''s more to discuss there, but we can skip
    past it. In three dimensions, that''s how many dimensions we have in space. In
    human experience, we are very good at spatial estimates and quick calculations,
    such as determining that a cup is in front of a bottle or that a cup is near the
    edge of the table. These kinds of spatial computations are very easy for us. Now,
    there''s nothing special about three dimensions, except that those are the dimensions
    you need to define space and time. However, you can extend this concept to define
    something that requires more than three numbers. Again, I don''t want to dwell
    on this point too much, but I will say that it relates to the Pythagorean theorem
    and how you measure distances. In one dimension, the distance from a point to
    the origin is trivially defined.'

    \ is how you calculate distance. You've all seen this, I'm sure, at various points\
    \ in your high school career. This is the particular case of using the Pythagorean\
    \ theorem in two dimensions. You replace A and B with X and Y, and then you have\
    \ a way to measure distance in two-dimensional space. In one-dimensional space,\
    \ it's very easy; the square root of 2 squared is just 2, so that's straightforward.\
    \ In two-dimensional space, to measure distance, you just add a Z. The formula\
    \ to measure distance in three-dimensional space is the square root of X squared\
    \ plus Y squared plus Z squared. You can keep going; there's nothing special about\
    \ two dimensions. You can add a W, you can add an L, you can add an M, and just\
    \ keep going. You lose the ability to plot it in a way that makes sense, but you\

    \ ten million dimensions.\n\nA lot of the AI stuff works this way; it uses that\

    \ to name things after the people who discover them, which can be quite annoying.\
    \ The same people often discover so many things that you end up replacing these\
    \ words all the time, and it's really frustrating. However, these coordinates\
    \ are called Cartesian, ostensibly named for Ren\xE9 Descartes. The story goes\
    \ that he was a sickly guy lying in bed watching a fly crawling on a window. He\
    \ realized that he could define the fly's position by looking at the intersection\
    \ point between the fly and two points on the windowsill. He then developed some\
    \ formalisms, which allowed him to name the concepts of a grid after himself.\
    \ It's frustrating, but that's the backstory. \n\nThis Cartesian space is typically\
    \ defined by characteristics like straight lines, grids, and squares. When you\
    \ move from two dimensions to three dimensions, you transition from a square to\
    \ a cube, and so forth. You can also define these types of constructs in angular\
    \ coordinates. For instance, if I care about a point in space, I can define it\
    \ using straight line projections onto the basis vector axes. I could also describe\
    \ it as being this far away at a specific angle off of zero degrees. \n\nI begin\
    \ with what we can call X and then move up at an angle, which can be in degrees,\
    \ radians, or whatever you prefer. I project out to a certain distance R and still\
    \ reach the same point in two-dimensional space. Instead of defining the point\
    \ in terms of X and Y, I can also define it in terms of theta and rho, where rho\
    \ represents the distance or radius. If this were a circle, it would be whatever\
    \ that distance is. \n\nAgain, notice that this is a two-dimensional point with\
    \ two degrees of freedom. I can define it either in linear XY coordinates or in\
    \ angular theta-rho coordinates. You need two numbers to define its position.\
    \ Once you have that, if you transition from 2D to 3D, the figures become spheres.\
    \ \n\nThe important thing to understand is that you can always switch back and\
    \ forth between linear coordinate systems and spherical coordinate systems, which\
    \ we refer to as polar coordinates versus Cartesian coordinates. In practice,\
    \ when you're doing calculations, you'll often switch back and forth depending\
    \ on the specific mathematical context. For instance, when examining joint angles,\

    measurement per time interval, and this is what your data actually looks like.
    We have to assume that the movement between the measured intervals is kind of
    like what we expect it to be, and if we do that, then we can connect the lines
    and get a nice time series. However, if this is one measurement every second,
    and I''m doing this with my hand, then it actually doesn''t look like that under
    the hood. If these intervals are like one every millisecond, then we can trust
    that. If it''s one every second, I could just as easily be doing this with my
    hand, and we only get these measurements every second. So if we interpolate, we''re
    going to be missing a lot of the story. That''s time. I''ll just say, just because
    it''s on the thing, that similar to space, time can also be thought of in two
    basic forms: linear time, sort of like a stopwatch, and phasic time, which is
    like a clock that resets to zero every cycle through the available values. That
    will become important in the future. If you care about calculus, if this is the
    position, the slope is the velocity because it''s the change in position over
    time. If you do that again, you get acceleration. So velocity is the derivative
    of position, and acceleration is the derivative of velocity. If you go back with
    the integrals, that''s all the calculus you ever need to know as far as I''m concerned.
    So that''s measurement. We''ve been talking about these measurements in terms
    of these abstract units, like singular sticks, but it doesn''t really matter.
    The same sort of methods of plotting will work no matter what units you''re measuring

    \ as a vendor in a medieval town needing to measure out various goods, it\u2019\
    s easier to use weights in increments of 12 and 16. This is particularly relevant\
    \ for activities like baking, where it's simple to cut ingredients in half or\

    \ A set number of base SI units exists, including seconds for time, meters for\
    \ length, kilograms for mass, amperes for electrical current, Kelvin for thermodynamic\
    \ temperature, moles for the amount of substance, and Candela for luminous intensity.\n\
    \nFor the most part, we will be focusing on these units: seconds, meters, and\
    \ kilograms. Now let's move to our first visual aid. One of the interesting aspects\
    \ of the metric system is the compatibility of its components. If this were one\
    \ meter, and if this were one liter, which it claims to be, we could use these\
    \ measurements to recreate most of the metric system. \n\nA liter is defined as\
    \ one thousand milliliters, and a milliliter is equivalent to a cubic centimeter\
    \ of water. A cubic centimeter of water weighs one gram. So, if you take a centimeter,\

    \ long a meter is and you have standardized water, you can recreate a lot of the\
    \ units that we end up using. \n\nTraditionally, the meter stick was measured\
    \ as this physical stick in France. There used to be an actual stick like this,\
    \ but it has rusted away over time, so now it just represents some markings on\
    \ a stone. We have since moved away from this method of determining a meter and\
    \ now measure it in relation to the distance that light travels. I can't remember\
    \ exactly how we used to define seconds, but it involved the period of a pendulum\
    \ of a given length. Now, we measure seconds in terms of the oscillation of a\
    \ cesium atom, as they oscillate at a very regular interval. We measure meters\
    \ by the distance that light travels in a specific number of oscillations of a\
    \ cesium atom. This measurement was designed to be the time it takes for light\
    \ to travel that distance, allowing us to be more precise with our modern measurements.\n\

    \ tells us how much our position changes in meters in one second, and acceleration\
    \ is in meters per second per second, indicating how much faster we are going\
    \ one second from now compared to right now. \n\nIf we jump ahead to Newton's\

    \ of the papers you read are not actively lying to you and falsifying all their\
    \ data. Each time you make an assumption, you gain a little more predictive power.\

    my wrist changes ever so slightly because I am made of squishy meat. However,
    if I assume that this is not happening and that I am actually composed of rigid
    bodies that do not change length, my math becomes significantly easier. I no longer
    have to measure the length between these points; I only have to measure the angles
    between them. The only measurement that can be made without making assumptions
    is that you are having a conscious experience at this exact moment, which is not
    particularly useful.


    This brings us back to the earlier discussion about the idea of conservation of
    energy. It is one of those very powerful and useful assumptions that can help
    us progress toward understanding the things we care about in our research objectives.
    For instance, if my goal is to understand something like standing posture or,
    God forbid, locomotion, there are many aspects of that question that I cannot
    measure empirically. I simply do not have the technological capacity to measure
    the firing in my cerebellum or the stretch forces in my muscles. However, I can
    measure things like the stick figure position of my body 33 times per second using
    a motion capture system that I built over time at home.


    By utilizing what I can measure and making certain assumptions about conservation
    of energy, I can begin to understand what we will refer to as the ''fiddly bits.''
    This concept will be further explored next week. For now, I want to cover as much
    material as possible so that you will have experienced it at least once.


    When performing a mechanical analysis of a person, you need to consider what forms
    of energy are relevant to the task at hand. In this part of the class, we are
    focused on measuring movement and the motor control aspect; we are not examining
    perception or vision. Therefore, we can ignore factors such as light and concentrate
    on the essential physics of being a massive object in a world that includes ground
    and gravity. The forms of energy that we can measure and care about the most are

  text: "Potential energy and kinetic energy have various forms. The most obvious\
    \ and easy one is gravitational potential energy, which is related to height.\
    \ We can consider the ground to be at zero height; the horizontal position does\
    \ not matter, but the vertical position does. Gravitational potential energy is\
    \ calculated as mass multiplied by gravity and height. Here, mass is measured\
    \ in kilograms, gravity in meters per second squared, and height is measured in\
    \ meters. When you do the math, you will find that the units will be in Newtons.\
    \ Essentially, potential energy measures the force that an object would exert\
    \ if dropped onto a scale. \n\nOther forms of potential energy, which we won't\
    \ focus on as much, include spring potential energy, related to the stretchiness\
    \ of springs, and chemical potential energy, such as that found in food, bombs,\
    \ gasoline, and other sources. In deeper levels of biology, we will delve more\
    \ into chemical potential energy, which is involved in ionic charge mismatches.\
    \ This relates to the concept of low energy states; for instance, if an object\
    \ is held above the ground, its low energy state is at rest on the ground. When\
    \ released, we can determine the energy upon impact.\n\nNow, let's consider kinetic\
    \ energy, which is the energy of motion. The formula for kinetic energy is one-half\
    \ times mass times velocity squared, represented as 1/2 MV\xB2. Here, mass is\
    \ again in kilograms and velocity in meters per second. The result will also be\
    \ in Newtons because it measures force. Kinetic energy represents the amount of\
    \ force that would be experienced at the precise moment before an object hits\
    \ the ground. The kinetic energy at this moment will equal the amount of gravitational\
    \ potential energy the object had before it was dropped. When these two energies\
    \ are combined, they account for the energy transformations taking place as the\
    \ object moves from a height to the ground."

    \ such as the parabolic flight of an object through space. As it leaves my hand,\
    \ it possesses an instantaneous moment of energy at the moment it breaks contact\
    \ with my hand. In free flight, it has a certain amount of kinetic energy, which\
    \ is the maximum energy it will have during its entire trajectory. At this point,\
    \ it has maximum kinetic energy and minimum potential energy. As it moves upward\
    \ through space, its kinetic energy slows down, and as it gets higher, the potential\
    \ energy increases until it reaches the apex. At this point, the potential energy\
    \ is at its maximum because it is as high as it will get, while the kinetic energy\
    \ is at a minimum, briefly reaching zero velocity as it transitions from rising\
    \ to falling. When it comes back down and reaches the exact moment it hits the\
    \ ground, it will have the same amount of kinetic energy as it had when it started.\
    \ This creates a nice trade-off between kinetic and potential energy. \n\nWhen\
    \ I talk about concepts like transduction for vision, action, or somatosensation,\
    \ we are discussing the transfer of energy from one form, such as light measured\
    \ in candelas, into another form, which is a pattern of neural activity that can\
    \ be measured by voltages and ion mismatches. There is much that remains unmeasurable\
    \ in that conversion. However, physics suggests that if we could tally up every\
    \ ion and every quantum of energy, the mathematics of that conversion would work\
    \ out as perfectly as the physics of simple ballistic motion. The transition between\
    \ kinetic and potential energy is also a form of transduction, representing a\
    \ transfer of energy from one form to another.\n\nIf I were a bird, I could flap\
    \ my wings and push against the air sufficiently to generate a reaction force\
    \ that counteracts gravity. If I were using a pogo stick and compressed it before\
    \ releasing it, it would contain spring potential energy that would allow it to\
    \ bounce upon hitting the ground. Assuming a simple rigid body scenario, the kinetic\
    \ and potential energy would demonstrate this nice conservative trade-off, which\
    \ will become important later."

  text: 'Now we get to my favorite part, which I will only touch on briefly. Next
    time, we will discuss this at length. This is the concept of the center of mass.
    The center of mass is a term in physics you have probably heard of; it comes up
    a lot in sports, especially anything related to gymnastics and balance. You hear
    people talk about the center of mass as the position of your body.


    The center of mass is the average position of all the components of a larger object.
    For instance, if I were to take this tube and cut it into one-centimeter long
    sections, then take the position of those sections relative to a zero point and
    calculate the average, it would be in the middle of the tube. That is the center
    of mass. When you are supporting something above the ground, you support the center
    of mass of the object. If I were to hold it over here, then the center of mass
    would fall, and it wouldn''t stay on my hand.


    For example, I have these ankle weights that I found on the street near my house.
    There is a place in the neighborhood where people leave things they no longer
    need. I found these weights, and they are somewhat useful for this demonstration.
    They weigh about a pound, which is roughly half a kilogram. Before I added the
    weights, the tube had uniform density, so the center of mass was in the middle.
    Now that it is not of uniform density, the center of mass shifts to this new position.


    Now, the center of mass of the entire system takes into account the shift and
    density of all components involved. If we wanted to, we could determine how much
    this system weighs by measuring the distance between the balance point and the
    center of the tube, which is where we would balance it if it were symmetrically
    oriented. However, I do not want to proceed with that right now.'

  text: "Could you see the concept of balance as the relationship between the center\
    \ of mass and the base of support? This is something we're going to discuss a\
    \ lot. Similarly, we talked a little about reductionist approaches to scientific\
    \ studies, which involves trying to nail down the problem. I mentioned before\
    \ that I want to measure something I care about, but I don't have the ability\
    \ to measure all the parts of it with the precision I need. One approach to dealing\
    \ with this problem is to narrow your focus. Instead of trying to explain the\
    \ entire complexity of the moving object, which is not available for empirical\
    \ measurement, you can look at a smaller piece of it. For example, instead of\
    \ examining the entire body, you might look at just the movement of a single joint\
    \ or a single arm. You can maintain a high level of fidelity by considering this\
    \ shape in terms of a thing that has all these joint angles that can define its\
    \ position at a given point in time. However, even for something like this, which\
    \ is a massive simplification of a human, it's still a complex object physically\
    \ speaking. There are still a lot of joints that can vary, and the number of degrees\
    \ of freedom you have is equal to the number of joints multiplied by two or three,\
    \ depending on how you count. To define the position of this kinematic object\
    \ in space requires many different numbers, which can be challenging to deal with.\
    \ The other approach is to simplify the system you're looking at into a significant\
    \ oversimplification and try to do so in a way that still allows you to make meaningful\
    \ statements about the system as a whole. This is essentially what the idea of\
    \ the center of mass is. Rather than thinking about this whole complex thing with\
    \ all the joints, muscles, blood pumping, and the biological realities involved,\
    \ we can condense it down into a simplified system. This is something I created\

  text: The full body center of mass is measured as the weighted sum of each of the
    body segments, such as the forearm, the upper arm, the head, the chest, and the
    legs. You take the average of all those positions, weighted by the mass of the
    specific segment. For example, the forearm weighs considerably less than the legs.
    This gives you the center of mass position. Then, if you measure the limits of
    the base of support here, it is the distance between the tips of the fingers and
    the heel of the hand, which are the points where you can exert force into the
    ground. The center of mass always stays within that space. You can understand
    that even though there are many biological factors involved, from a physics perspective,
    you can define the task of balance using very simplified models of the body. This
    reduction takes the entire complexity of a human being and boils it down to a
    singular point mass, which can represent two dimensions or even three dimensions.
    We have simplified the world to a place that feels more manageable. I am capable
    of handling a certain number of numbers, but not too many. By the way, on the
    list in the notes, if you click on the link, it takes you to various animations
    that I created. We will discuss those more later. You can reduce this complex
    object of a human down to a singular point mass. Physics indicates that what is
    said about the center of mass of a system is to some extent true for all the objects
    in that system; this might be related to the finite element theorem, but I am
    not entirely sure about that. Essentially, discussing the center of mass of a
    person is a valid approximation of the full picture that would emerge if we measured
    every single part of their body simultaneously. However, it is clear that you
    would lose a lot of information. For instance, if I am reducing this entire person's
    body to that singular mass, I can no longer accurately comment on joint angles
    or the forces at the elbow, but I can determine whether or not they are in a stable
    or unstable regime.

    about the physics of his body to start trying to infer what some of these wiggles

    analysis, it might be hard to explain why his arm is out here; there might not
    be much to say about that. But when you''re thinking about it like this, it becomes
    very easy. He sticks his arm out so that his center of mass... if I move my arm

    ask the question: how do we do these measurements? How do we get these numbers?
    And how do I know where to draw the segment center of mass for his torso? For
    example, what percentage of body weight is a forearm? How do you get those numbers?
    Well, it turns out we just have these lookup tables; this is called anthropometry.
    These are just statistics. Ah, wrong way. Right. These particular lookup tables
    come from a guy named David Winter. This is copied from a textbook of his from
    like 1995 or something like that, and it shows these measurements of the shoulder
    as 0.129H, where H is the body height. Then, these are the lookup tables for these
    segments. The forearm is defined as the distance between the elbow axis and the
    styloid, I guess, that''s here. It''s 0.28 of body mass, and the center of mass
    is 4.36% of the weight from the proximal joint, which is the one towards the middle,
