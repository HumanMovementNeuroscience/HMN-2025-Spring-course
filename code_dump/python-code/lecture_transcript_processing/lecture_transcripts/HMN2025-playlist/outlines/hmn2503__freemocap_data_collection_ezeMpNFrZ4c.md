# HMN25-03 - FreeMoCap Data Collection

## Introduction to FreeMoCap
- Overview of FreeMoCap as a motion capture system.
- Discussion of its applications in various fields, including biomechanics and robotics.

## Data Collection Techniques
- Explanation of the methods used to collect motion capture data.
- Importance of soft tissue considerations in data collection.
  - Mention of personal experiences with soft tissue and muscle interactions to prevent injuries.

## Analysis of Motion Capture Data
- Importance of center of mass as a measurement in motion capture.
  - Center of mass provides a reliable metric even when data fidelity is compromised.
  - Global data can be analyzed despite local fidelity issues due to the smoothing effect of center of mass calculations.
