## Visual Processing in the Brain
- The primary visual cortex is the main area for visual processing in the brain.
- A significant portion of the brain is dedicated to vision.
- Approximately 50% of the visual cortex is focused on processing the central one degree of the visual field, which corresponds to the size of a thumbnail at arm's length.
- This allocation indicates that 50% of photoreceptors and visual cortex architecture is devoted to just 1% of the visual field.
- The ability to move our eyes precisely is crucial for effectively guiding motor behavior. 

## Conclusion of the Class
- The lecture concludes with a summary of the importance of visual processing in relation to motor behavior.
- The instructor announces plans to return next Wednesday for the continuation of the course.
