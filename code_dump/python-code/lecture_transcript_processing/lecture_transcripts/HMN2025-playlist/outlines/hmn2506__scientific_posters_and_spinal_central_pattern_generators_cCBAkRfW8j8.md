# HMN25-06 - Scientific Posters and Spinal Central Pattern Generators

## Introduction to Spinal Central Pattern Generators
   - Explanation of spinal central pattern generators (CPGs) and their role in motor control.
   - Discussion of how CPGs can generate rhythmic patterns of movement without sensory feedback.

## The Role of the Dopaminergic Reward System
   - Description of the dopaminergic reward system and its function in reinforcing neural activity.
   - Connection between the prefrontal cortex and the reward system in decision-making and motivation.
   - Example of how the desire for a reward (e.g., chocolate) triggers neural activity that reinforces the behavior leading to that reward.

## Neural Activity and Neuroplasticity
   - Explanation of how reinforcement of neural pathways can lead to the regrowth of neurons at the spinal level.
   - Discussion of the implications of this process for understanding recovery and rehabilitation in motor function.

## Conclusion of the Lecture
   - Summary of key points discussed regarding spinal CPGs and the dopaminergic reward system.
   - Acknowledgment of the complexity of the topics and the intention to explore further in future classes.
   - Reminder of the next class discussion on two additional papers related to the subject matter.
