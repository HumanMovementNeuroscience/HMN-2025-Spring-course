# HMN25: Philosophy of science, empiricism, and the scientific method

## Summary
The philosophy of science, empiricism, and the scientific method are foundational concepts that guide the pursuit of knowledge in the natural and social sciences. This theme explores the principles of scientific inquiry, the role of empirical evidence in validating theories, and the philosophical underpinnings that shape scientific practices. Key highlights include:
- The significance of empirical measurement and the role of SI units in standardizing scientific communication.
- The interplay between epistemology and the interpretation of data in human movement studies.
- The transition from philosophical inquiry to empirical research in understanding human behavior.
