# HMN25: Human Perceptual Motor Neuroscience

## Summary
Human perceptual motor neuroscience is a multidisciplinary field that explores the intricate relationship between sensory perception and motor control. This theme encompasses the neural mechanisms that underlie how humans perceive their environment and how this perception informs motor actions. Key highlights include:

- The significant role of the visual system in guiding motor behavior.
- The importance of eye tracking technology in understanding visual processing.
- The relevance of spinal central pattern generators in motor control.
- The interplay between sensory input and motor output in human behavior.
