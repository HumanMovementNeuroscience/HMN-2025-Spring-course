# HMN25: Biomechanics, posture, and balance

## Summary
Biomechanics, posture, and balance are critical components of human movement and motor control. Understanding these elements is essential for analyzing how humans interact with their environment and maintain stability during various activities. This outline explores the significance of postural control, the role of biomechanics in movement, and the implications for research and practical applications in the field of human perceptual motor neuroscience.

### Highlights:
- The importance of postural control in maintaining stability and facilitating movement.
- The role of biomechanics in understanding human motion and balance.
- The integration of empirical data analysis techniques, such as FreeMoCap, in studying posture and movement.
