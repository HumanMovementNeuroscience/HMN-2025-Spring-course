- The cerebellum's layered organization reflects phylogenetic development, with newer structures on the outside and older structures inside.

### Motor Planning and the Brain
- The process of perceiving an object, such as a cat, involves a neural cascade that activates the visual cortex and leads to the creation of a motor plan.
- The motor system operates hierarchically, with high-level volition originating in the frontal lobe and being broken down into specific commands for muscle firing.
- The brainstem, including the medulla oblongata and pons, is responsible for basic life functions and serves as the start of the spinal cord, which is crucial for processing information.
- The central nervous system is defined as the region where processing occurs, transforming incoming information before output, with the spinal cord also playing a significant role in this processing.

## Spinal Cord and Central Pattern Generators
- The instructor discusses studies on cats where severing the spine allows for continued walking due to the presence of central pattern generators in the spinal cord.
- Central pattern generators manage the basic rhythmic motion of the legs, indicating the alternating stance and swing phases of movement.
- Much of the processing for these movements occurs within the spinal cord itself, which ends below the thoracic spine and transitions into the cauda equina, where gray matter diminishes and peripheral nerves extend to the limbs.

### Distinction Between Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems
- The instructor emphasizes the distinction between the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS), noting the gray areas in this separation.
- The retina is presented as an example of this gray area, containing neurons that perform computational processes before signals travel to the brain.

- A study involving a monkey trained to grab objects is discussed, illustrating how a temporary lesion in the peripersonal perception area led to cortical blindness, expanding the blind spot to include areas reachable with a grabber arm.
- Proprioception is highlighted as a key factor in body awareness, where the body encodes forces exerted by limbs, contributing to the understanding of body position.
- The instructor emphasizes that movements are coordinated across multiple joints rather than executed one joint at a time, with the cerebellum playing a crucial role in this coordination.
- The iterative perception-action loop is described, where actions alter the state of the world, leading to new perceptions and further actions.
- Fields associated with the discussed topics include optology (physiology of the eyeball), visual neuroscience (neural activity related to vision), and motor neuroscience (neuroscience of movement).
- The distinction between peripheral neurons is made, with motor neurons carrying commands from the CNS to the periphery and sensory neurons transmitting information back to the CNS.
- The instructor reflects on the limited awareness of internal bodily processes, suggesting that conscious experience is a thin layer over a complex underlying system, likening it to an oil sheen on murky water.

## Consciousness and Awareness
- The instructor discusses the complexity of biological neural systems and the limited access individuals have to their internal processes.
- Conscious experiences, such as the awareness of motor unit recruitment during weightlifting, are mapped to underlying physiological mechanisms, though this awareness is often superficial.
- Initial performance gains in weightlifting are attributed to the body learning to fire motor units simultaneously rather than actual muscle growth.
- Performance plateaus occur when all motor units are recruited, but muscle strength may not be sufficient to produce the required force, highlighting the distinction between neuromechanics and muscle growth.

### Neuromechanics and Biomechanics
- Neuromechanics is introduced as a field at the intersection of neural activity and mechanics, focusing on how motor units create forces to move limbs.
- Biomechanics applies Newton's Laws to biological systems, analyzing human movement without biological considerations, such as center of mass and base of support.
