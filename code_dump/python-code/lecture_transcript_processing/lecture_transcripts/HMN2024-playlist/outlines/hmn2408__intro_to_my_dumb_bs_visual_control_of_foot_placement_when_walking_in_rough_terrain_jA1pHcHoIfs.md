# [HMN24#08]  Intro to My Dumb BS (visual control of foot placement when walking in rough terrain)

## Introduction to Visual Emotion
   - Definition of visual emotion as the feeling experienced by the nervous system in everyday life.

## Research Overview
   - Discussion of a 2024 paper utilizing photogrammetry for 3D reconstructions of terrain.
   - Transition from flat ground plane analysis to incorporating 3D aspects of terrain.

## Analysis of Foot Placement
   - Examination of how individuals choose their footholds when navigating rough terrain.
   - Investigation of decision-making factors, such as whether to step onto a rock or go around it.
   - Findings indicate that foothold choices are influenced by the height of the individual.
      - Taller individuals are more likely to step onto rocks, while shorter individuals face higher costs in doing so.

## Preferences in Terrain Navigation
   - Discovery that people tend to prefer slopes within a certain range when selecting footholds.
   - Mention of simulated potential foothold paths and the decision-making process involved.

## Conclusion of Research Presentation
   - Summary of the research findings and their implications for understanding navigation in rough terrain.
   - Acknowledgment of the complexity of the analysis and reference to previous work by Canan in 2015.
   - Closing remarks expressing hope that the audience gained a better understanding of the topic since the beginning of the course.
   - Announcement of the next lecture topic on trauma and future discussions.
