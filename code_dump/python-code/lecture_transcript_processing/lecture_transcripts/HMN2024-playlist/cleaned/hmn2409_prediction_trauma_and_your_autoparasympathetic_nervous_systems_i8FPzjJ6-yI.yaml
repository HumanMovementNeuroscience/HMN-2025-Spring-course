full_transcript: "Okay, hello everybody, settle down. Welcome to this Bonus Week,\
  \ and thank you for showing up. Because this class doesn't have a class the first\
  \ week of the semester, and the semester starts on Wednesday, it's like this weird\
  \ little half-week that is kind of part of that. I appreciate you showing up. If\
  \ you're watching this on a video and didn't show up, I understand.\n\nSo, the cadence\
  \ of the semester has actually been working out pretty nicely. Last time, we had\
  \ the fun little walkthrough of my prior research experience, providing a hypothetically\
  \ sufficient background to cover it. Now, this is the second-to-last class of the\
  \ semester. It's kind of a little bit of a bonus lecture.\n\nThis time, I'm going\
  \ to talk about your autonomic nervous system, particularly as it relates to trauma\
  \ and the neurophysiological effects of trauma on the body. We will explore the\
  \ ways that this interacts and overlaps with all the things we've been learning\
  \ this semester about how bodies work and the balancing act we have between the\
  \ parts of our bodies and nervous system that we have theoretically direct access\
  \ and control over, and the parts that are more like the ocean we float on top of.\
  \ We'll discuss how these elements play into each other.\n\nNext week will be the\
  \ final class of the semester; there is no proper final, so I will spend that time\
  \ doing a wrap-up and presenting my class project. This project aims to make sense\
  \ of the tremendous amount of input you've provided into the server. I'll create\
  \ an official assignment on Canvas about what to do to wrap up your efforts here.\n\
  \nI will probably spend Thanksgiving adding a few extra features to the bot and\
  \ some of the visualizations I've been showing throughout the semester. There will\
  \ be some assignment that will look something like this: make sure you've had at\
  \ least this many chats here and there. Additionally, there will be an exit interview-type\
  \ conversation where you'll talk to the bot. At that point, I hope to have a way\
  \ of extracting your specific conversations and incorporating them into the conversation,\
  \ so you can discuss with the bot about your experiences and insights. The semester\
  \ went, and what you discovered and found will be fun to look at. So, let's get\
  \ into this. I dropped a link to the sloppy notes that I have on the GitHub page,\
  \ and I will try to go through this in a structured way. This area of neuroscience,\
  \ at the autonomic level, is not something that I have direct professional experience\
  \ in. A lot of the stuff we have been talking about this semester is on the perceptual\
  \ motor side of life, such as eye movements, motion capture, and that kind of biomechanic\
  \ stuff. That is an area in which I consider myself a contributing expert, and I\
  \ have a solid awareness of the field, in terms of knowing the literature and understanding\
  \ the methods, as well as being steeped in the culture of people who research that\
  \ type of thing.\n\nHowever, this topic is getting closer to areas where I don't\
  \ share the same relationship. I do know a lot about it in various ways, but my\
  \ knowledge stems from what we might consider the concept of an intelligent layperson.\
  \ This is someone who isn't a professional expert in a field but is a smart person\
  \ who has looked into it and read about it. Much scientific writing intentionally\
  \ targets this intelligent layperson audience. I have read some books about this\
  \ topic, but I haven't conducted extensive research or engaged in direct research\
  \ in the area.\n\nInterestingly, because of my background, the popular science type\
  \ of literature that I enjoy connects with the domains where I do possess deeper\
  \ knowledge. As you can watch throughout the lecture, you'll see how the topics\
  \ we have discussed intersect. It's intriguing for me to examine the gaps in knowledge\
  \ that I experience as an outsider while also recognizing that my unique perspective\
  \ might contribute to this area in meaningful ways. So, let's get into it. Let's\
  \ talk about your various nervous systems. You have one main one, which is roughly\
  \ speaking your entire body. There are several other delineations of your nervous\
  \ system, and the ones we tend to discuss the most in the field of neuroscience\
  \ are the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. \n\nThe central\
  \ nervous system is what you typically think about in neuroscience. Specifically,\
  \ it comprises the brain, which we refer to as the cortex, and it's this large,\
  \ lumpy pink structure on top. The peripheral nervous system is the other side of\
  \ that. The central nervous system includes the cortex, which is the pink, wrinkly\
  \ part on top, and it also includes the subcortical regions, like the cerebellum\
  \ at the back, as well as areas like the basal ganglia and thalamus, which are wrapped\
  \ inside the big pink wrinkly part. It also includes your spine and similar structures.\n\
  \nThe basic functional delineation we use for the central nervous system is that\
  \ it is the area where processing occurs. This is where information that has come\
  \ in through the senses is manipulated and transformed into the basis for motor\
  \ behavior or action. However, this distinction, like everything else here, is a\
  \ simplified version of reality. It serves as a reasonable way to categorize things,\
  \ but there are all sorts of overlaps and gray areas, as nature often exhibits.\n\
  \nThis is particularly true in areas like the eye, such as in your retina, or in\
  \ the complex array of sensors on your skin. These parts of the nervous system would\
  \ typically be considered part of the peripheral nervous system, dealing with sensory\
  \ and motor aspects. Yet, they perform functions that resemble computations. The\
  \ immediate distinction between the central and peripheral nervous systems can be\
  \ illustrated simply, where the central nervous system resembles a charming little\
  \ off-center brain shape along with the spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous\
  \ system is often thought of as just the wiring that brings sensory information\
  \ from the external environment. parts of your body into the central nervous system\
  \ and the sort of flip-flopped wires that send motor commands from the central nervous\
  \ system out to the periphery. This is the sort of cartoon version that you will\
  \ often see in textbooks. It's not incorrect; it\u2019s not a bad way to describe\
  \ things, but it's inherently incomplete and cartoonified, in the way that we often\
  \ do when we try to parse nature, which, as we've discussed in many ways on many\
  \ days, is sort of an impossible thing to do. So first is the peripheral nervous\
  \ system\u2014that's mostly what we've been talking about here\u2014and that kind\
  \ of basic distinction is there. However, there are other sub-distinctions that\
  \ we can make into other aspects of the different nerve groups that we find in the\
  \ body. Generally speaking, neuroscience is the science of neurons, and your neurons\
  \ sit in these different functional roles in your body. I\u2019m realizing that\
  \ even this distinction that I'm about to make is also kind of a flipped or chopped\
  \ up version of reality. When I sat down to write these notes, I thought of the\
  \ central nervous system, the peripheral nervous system, the enteric nervous system,\
  \ and the autonomic nervous system. But I realized that those could arguably be\
  \ thought of as four distinct things, or you could consider them to be subcategories\
  \ of the two categories I just mentioned. You could also say language is incomplete,\
  \ and we name things as they are useful to us. Broadly speaking, the central nervous\
  \ system is like the central processor and the main computational aspect of your\
  \ neurons, while the peripheral nervous system consists of sensory and motor components.\
  \ The enteric nervous system, which is a term I learned this morning, is the fancy\
  \ term for your gut, which is one of those areas that I remember, when I started\
  \ in grad school around 2008, people began to really understand that your gut is\
  \ essentially its own entity. There\u2019s a lot going on in the way that the nerves\
  \ are connected and how decisions are made regarding when various tubes will start\
  \ doing peristalsis and which gland should secrete what into which area at which\
  \ time. Not to mention, the whole microbiome that\u2019s present plays a critical\
  \ role. As the complexity of that gut nervous system has gradually become more apparent\
  \ in the scientific research community, it has been percolating out into the general\
  \ understanding as well. In the world at large, all the things you're seeing about\
  \ gut health and your microbiome are kind of right on schedule. They are showing\
  \ up about a decade after they started to emerge in the scientific literature. We\
  \ don't have as much to say about the enteric nervous system, but it will come back\
  \ into the conversation because it interacts with the autonomic nervous system in\
  \ a way that's interesting. We'll talk about that sort of towards the bottom. The\
  \ last bit, the star of the show today, is your autonomic nervous system. The prefix\
  \ 'auto' refers to the root of automatic. Your autonomic nervous system is the part\
  \ of your nervous system that handles the basics, the essential functions that keep\
  \ you alive. It's the low-level system that addresses what you need to survive as\
  \ an individual organism and as a species. I mentioned at some point that the nervous\
  \ system, particularly in the central area, could be argued by some to be distinct\
  \ from the enteric nervous system, possibly as a subcomponent of the peripheral\
  \ nervous system. Who knows if they would be able to defend that position to relevant\
  \ experts, but those who like to categorize would place the autonomic nervous system\
  \ as a subcomponent of the central nervous system. There\u2019s a distinction to\
  \ consider. Often, when you look at the brain and the central nervous system, you\
  \ can kind of get a map of the evolutionary history of that part of the nervous\
  \ system by examining it from the inside out. The innermost part of your nervous\
  \ system is typically the oldest. As you go outward, like the layers of an onion\
  \ or a flower, the outer edges tend to be the most recently developed. The neocerebellum,\
  \ which is sometimes referred to as the new part of the cerebellum, is also known\
  \ as the neocortex, the new part of the cortex. A similar story is true on a smaller\
  \ scale, in terms of volume, but on a larger scale in terms of the number of neurons\
  \ at the cerebellum level. There\u2019s a similar distinction where the middle parts\
  \ are the oldest, and as you move outward, you encounter the more phylogenetically\
  \ new parts. Then the outside is the neocerebellum, which is thought to be associated\
  \ with tool use and similar functions. The really fine motor control that we are\
  \ good at is closely related to the autonomic nervous system. We are referring to\
  \ the inner parts, the deep structures like the brainstem and the medulla oblongata.\
  \ If you think of your central controller, it resembles a fist; the fist represents\
  \ your spine coming down, with the deeper subcortical regions residing at the top.\
  \ These areas are among the oldest parts of our nervous system. The cortex has been\
  \ described as the flower on top of the bush. If you picture a rosebush, there is\
  \ this beautiful red flower on top, and we spend a lot of time focusing on that\
  \ flower. However, when you examine the plant, the majority of it is bush, with\
  \ the flower being merely a fascinating aspect. Strictly speaking, that bush could\
  \ still function normally without the rose, except for reproducing more bushes.\
  \ My botanical knowledge might not be very strong here. This is also where you'll\
  \ often hear discussions about the mammalian brain versus the reptilian brain. The\
  \ pink, wrinkled cortex is associated with the mammalian parts, while the deeper\
  \ regions are more connected to the reptilian aspects, as those evolved much earlier.\
  \ Most of our vertebrate friends, who share basic functionalities such as having\
  \ a heart and a nervous system, have a centralized set of neurons that control most\
  \ bodily functions. This contrasts with insects or cephalopods like octopuses, which\
  \ have a more distributed nervous system. In their systems, there isn't the same\
  \ distinction between a concentrated area of important parts and a more diffuse\
  \ set of responsibilities in the periphery. All of our vertebrate friends, especially\
  \ tetrapods\u2014those with two arms and two legs\u2014share a similar structure,\
  \ which marks the terminus of the spinal cord. Our chordate friends exhibit a similar\
  \ shape in this regard. The autonomic nervous system manages the basic needs and\
  \ functions. For survival, it is at this point that I get to make a joke that all\
  \ neuroscience professors are required to make in undergraduate classrooms. The\
  \ autonomic nervous system handles the four Fs of survival: feeding, fighting, fleeing,\
  \ and procreation. This is the classic joke. The basic idea is that these are the\
  \ things you need to be able to do; you need to be able to eat food, fight when\
  \ necessary, run away when necessary, and then engage in the complex behaviors that\
  \ help proliferate the species. The autonomic nervous system is thought to handle\
  \ a lot of that.\n\nAs we break things down into increasingly small categories,\
  \ your autonomic nervous system can be considered to involve two main aspects. Even\
  \ though I do a lot of searching for images related to these topics, which sometimes\
  \ feels a little lazy, I find it helpful to show the process. It allows us to see\
  \ the different types of cartoons and images that we use to discuss these concepts.\
  \ Some images have greater or lesser detail, and some have more or less resemblance\
  \ to what you might actually observe if you were to take an organism, dissect it,\
  \ and take pictures. Others are much more cartoonified.\n\nIt is important to notice\
  \ that all of these images are cartoons. None of them are accurate representations,\
  \ and none will show you what you would see if you cut open any actual human, nor\
  \ do they represent what you would see if you cut open all possible humans, which\
  \ I don't recommend doing either. We tend to have this fiction that these pictures\
  \ somehow represent reality, but really, they represent the best approximation we\
  \ have for carving up reality into conceptual boxes that are simple enough for us\
  \ to understand.\n\nFor example, this cartoon of the brain has fewer details than\
  \ that cartoon of the brain, but they're both cartoons and both impose false separations.\
  \ This part is colored one way, that part is colored another. We call this part\
  \ the parietal lobe and that part the occipital lobe, and we don\u2019t choose these\
  \ colors randomly. They help us categorize and understand the brain's structure,\
  \ even if simplistically. We must always remember that we put these words into nature.\
  \ We didn't crack open the brain and see a stamp that said, \"This is the parietal\
  \ lobe.\" We discovered that if we call this thing a certain name, then we can say\
  \ things about the whole region, which tends to be more accurate than if we talked\
  \ about a different part of the brain. For example, the occipital lobe is where\
  \ the visual cortex resides. When we talk about vision, we're primarily referring\
  \ to this area. However, you won't find visual functions exclusively in this part\
  \ of the nervous system; you absolutely will find them in other areas as well. \n\
  \nThere will be a particular search that shows a stark distinction between scientific\
  \ concepts and what might be considered \"woo woo\" stuff. Much of what we discuss\
  \ will touch on the boundary between proper science\u2014which I wouldn't recommend\u2014\
  and popular conceptions of science, as well as what we might call pseudoscience.\
  \ Pseudoscience does not align with our scientific understanding in the way that\
  \ we would expect popular science to do. For instance, I would argue that undergraduate\
  \ textbooks on neuroscience exist on the edge of popular science, as they present\
  \ simplified versions of the story for people who do not have a strong background\
  \ in the field. These textbooks do not convey the complexity and chaos of professional\
  \ scientific work; instead, they start with different layers of simplification and\
  \ then gradually guide students towards a more realistic understanding of the world,\
  \ which is much more chaotic and mixed up.\n\nNow, regarding the autonomic nervous\
  \ system, it has two main branches, which we refer to as the sympathetic and parasympathetic\
  \ nervous systems. These are again simplifications. On one side, you have the fight\
  \ or flight aspects, associated with high speed and high arousal states necessary\
  \ for survival in a world where predation has evolved. On the other side, the parasympathetic\
  \ nervous system is referred to as the rest and digest aspects of our nervous system,\
  \ responsible for processes such as sleeping, digesting food, and feeling relaxed.\
  \ Calm those kinds of things. As I was looking into the deeper aspects of this area,\
  \ I engaged in activities such as reading, scanning review articles, and reviewing\
  \ the Wikipedia page. I always recommend this for any new domain. I wanted to check\
  \ the things I thought I knew and see if I could find connections to more established\
  \ research. As is often the case, there is a lot of shifting in the way we think\
  \ about the autonomic nervous system and the sympathetic-parasympathetic divide:\
  \ who has what role, how we should think about them, and if it really is that straightforward.\
  \ \n\nWhen I talk about this, I aim to appropriately mix the information I usually\
  \ share, which is based on older concepts, with what appears to be the new ways\
  \ of thinking emerging in the field. In general, whenever I discuss something that\
  \ seems simple, it is never that simple. So when I say something like, \"Here\u2019\
  s the autonomic nervous system; there are two parts: this one does this and that\
  \ one does that,\" those hard delineations and simplified divisions of labor tend\
  \ to mask the complexity underneath. If you actually poke at it and dig deeper,\
  \ the reality is that it's always more complicated than that. These are the cartoon\
  \ stories we tell because of a combination of what we used to think\u2014often simpler\
  \ explanations than they ought to be\u2014and the basic distinctions we begin with\
  \ when explaining concepts to others. It's not always functional to start every\
  \ conversation by saying, \"It's too complex to understand in fifteen lifetimes,\"\
  \ so we tend to start with the simpler cartoons. \n\nTherefore, let\u2019s stick\
  \ with this rough delineation for now: the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous\
  \ systems\u2014fight or flight, rest or relax. It's very hard to remember these\
  \ things. This is one of many areas of science, especially neuroscience, where a\
  \ couple of centuries ago, someone decided to name two concepts with nearly identical-sounding\
  \ words, like afferent and efferent for sensory versus motor nerves. I still don't\
  \ know which is which. I think afferent relates to sensory nerves and happens after\
  \ the event, while efferent affects the world and relates to motor nerves, but I\
  \ bet whoever created that distinction thought they were quite clever. I will hold\
  \ a grudge against them forever. Therefore, we tend to rely on these simplified\
  \ terms. On pneumonics for that, my particular mnemonic for the sympathetic and\
  \ parasympathetic nervous systems is that the sympathetic is the fight or flight\
  \ response, because you're ready to confront a threat. In contrast, the parasympathetic\
  \ is like eating a pear; you're relaxing and enjoying life. It's not a perfect mnemonic,\
  \ but it's the best one I have. I realize that some of you may go off to medical\
  \ school and will need to memorize information, which is something I am personally\
  \ allowed to skim through. That could be a good use of that technology.\n\nSo, we\
  \ have sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. Sympathetic is associated with the\
  \ fight or flight response. One distinction I came across is that a better way to\
  \ think of it is that the sympathetic nervous system is tuned for high-speed, fast-paced,\
  \ low-latency actions that require arousal and typically activate your muscular-skeletal\
  \ system in order to respond to the environment quickly. In contrast, the parasympathetic\
  \ nervous system manages slower, calmer, and quieter processes that unfold over\
  \ long periods of time, such as digestion and sleep, as opposed to getting into\
  \ a fight.\n\nOf course, there are many aspects of our behavior that require a combination\
  \ of both systems. For example, consider playing sports, where good performance\
  \ necessitates a blend of fast and precise actions along with a calm state of mind\
  \ to avoid panicking. There are various socio-personal and physiological processes\
  \ that similarly need a complex balance of arousal and relaxation.\n\nWhen you look\
  \ up the autonomic nervous system, you'll often see diagrams illustrating the functions\
  \ of the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems; the parasympathetic system connects\
  \ to certain parts of your body, while the sympathetic system connects to others.\
  \ In many respects, these descriptions are reasonable, and I also believe that the\
  \ autonomic nervous system, as described in various sources like Wikipedia, provides\
  \ a helpful framework for understanding these concepts. On this page, we'll talk\
  \ about the pictures in a second. There are some nice tables and a lot of physiology\
  \ information, which, in my area of research, I tend to avoid learning too much\
  \ about. However, these letters and numbers refer to vertebrae, such as T6, T7,\
  \ and T8, which correspond to the sixth, seventh, and eighth vertebrae of your thoracic\
  \ region. You have cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions, and so on.\n\nNow, down\
  \ here in the function section, there are nice lists that typically describe the\
  \ aspects of your sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, which tend to\
  \ be paired with one another. The parasympathetic connection to your gut stimulates\
  \ digestion and initiates peristalsis and secretion of various substances into different\
  \ areas. In contrast, your sympathetic nervous system tends to shut down these functions.\
  \ The reasoning is that if you're going to get into a fight, you don't want to waste\
  \ energy on digestion.\n\nAs you analyze these functions, think of the things necessary\
  \ for general survival, which are activated by the parasympathetic nervous system,\
  \ versus the optional subsystems you would want to deactivate if you were in a fight-or-flight\
  \ situation, activated by the sympathetic nervous system. Essentially, you don't\
  \ digest food when you're in a fight; the thought process is that this will be handled\
  \ later.\n\nThere are some interesting connections that we will revisit if I manage\
  \ my time properly, such as those related to your eyes, your iris, and pupil constriction.\
  \ I discovered an interesting fact: the parasympathetic system affects the lens\
  \ inside your eye. When you look at something and defocus, you are controlling the\
  \ lens, and those muscles interact interestingly with the sympathetic and parasympathetic\
  \ functions.\n\nReturning to the anatomical aspects of your nervous system, there\
  \ are specific characteristics that are associated with the sympathetic and parasympathetic\
  \ parts of your body. If you are on the side of arguing that the autonomic nervous\
  \ system (ANS) is not a part of your central nervous system, you would point to\
  \ specific anatomical features to support your claim. You might say that these structures\
  \ exist outside of the spine, and therefore, they belong to the peripheral nervous\
  \ system. However, I wouldn't go so far as to define them strictly as part of the\
  \ peripheral system because they are indeed outside of your spine, but they are\
  \ very close to it. So, it becomes difficult to categorize them clearly. The argument\
  \ continues, particularly regarding the sympathetic nervous system, which relates\
  \ to an interesting aspect called the sympathetic trunk. This structure consists\
  \ of pairs of ganglia that run down the edge of your spine on the outside. A ganglion\
  \ is essentially a cluster of neurons. For example, we often discuss retinal ganglion\
  \ cells that pool together different photoreceptors. Many organisms, including insects\
  \ and other creatures lacking a central nervous system, have ganglia. For instance,\
  \ dragonflies possess ganglia and bulbs that manage their visual inputs and motor\
  \ outputs. When we start considering the distinction between a ganglion and a central\
  \ nervous system, we delve into linguistic territory; the definitions become less\
  \ clear.  \n\nThe sympathetic trunk comprises these clusters of neurons that run\
  \ alongside your spine. This structure is essential for where your sympathetic nervous\
  \ system interacts with your body. To visualize this, think of the top structure\
  \ as a knob and understand that it extends down to the lower regions, such as L5,\
  \ which is approximately located around here. At the very bottom, what we refer\
  \ to as the cauda equina resembles a horse's tail. Along the spine, you find these\
  \ paired sets of ganglia that are typically associated with the sympathetic nervous\
  \ system. These ganglia become activated, triggering an increase in arousal. In\
  \ situations that suggest a fight-or-flight response, the sympathetic nervous system\
  \ ramps up general activation in the body. This process is managed by the ganglion\
  \ cells that help regulate this increased level of arousal. I think about this a\
  \ lot, particularly when considering how we need to be cautious about oversimplifying\
  \ our understanding of the nervous system. Body and biology in general, you also\
  \ have to be careful when doing the thing that I'm about to do, which is starting\
  \ to use your own personal experience of being inside of one of these weird meat\
  \ puppets to make sense of some of the stuff that you see in terms of anatomy. You\
  \ have to be careful about it, but you don't have to be that careful about it, because\
  \ if you think about what the nervous system, specifically the sympathetic nervous\
  \ system, does, it tends to be a part of being startled or scared. Like, oh my God,\
  \ there's something over there. One of my favorite nervous system responses is the\
  \ startle reflex, which is a part of our nervous system that we share with houseflies.\
  \ It's like a large, looming object, and you have that jump response. For me, there's\
  \ this strong association between those types of startle responses and a light,\
  \ like lightning, going down your spine, as if it's a shocking moment. \n\nI was\
  \ fascinated to discover, perhaps a little embarrassingly late in my career as a\
  \ neuroscientist\u2014partially because I started as a philosophy major, so I missed\
  \ a lot of the standard undergraduate introduction stuff\u2014that what these responses\
  \ do is tell your body to dump adrenaline. They crank up your muscles, increase\
  \ sensitivities, lower pain sensitivities, and enhance a sort of low-level activation\
  \ so you can respond quicker to stimuli. This kind of Wolverine-like response comes\
  \ from these systems getting cranked on. Of course, I'm describing a very high level\
  \ of crank, but the somatic experience of having this kind of lightning run down\
  \ your spine is associated with those startle responses. \n\nAcademically, I learned\
  \ that the startle response is associated with a set of paired ganglion cells that\
  \ run down your spine. It's one of those things where I wonder if that's the same\
  \ thing or if I'm just telling stories to myself. Is there a difference between\
  \ those feelings and the cartoons we see here? Who knows? But from an anatomical\
  \ perspective, the sympathetic nervous system is associated with these paired spinal\
  \ ganglion cells in the sympathetic trunk. If you're wondering what this strange\
  \ picture here is, it almost resembles a subway map. It doesn't tell you exactly\
  \ the layout, but it indicates that if you're trying to get from this point to that\
  \ point, you should take this route. The direction you're going is vital when considering\
  \ how it relates to these shapes, which I believe are associated with activation\
  \ versus inhibition. This part connects to that part, and actually, no, sorry, these\
  \ ones up here are more peripheral. Speaking of the blue lines, the red lines represent\
  \ the sympathetic nervous system, and the blue lines correspond to the parasympathetic\
  \ nervous system. Here, I have to put a big disclaimer because we are now going\
  \ to discuss the vagus nerve, which is a real anatomical feature. It's used in various\
  \ discussions about how to calm your nervous system and relate to the world.\n\n\
  In this realm, good-hearted people often find ways of explaining the world that\
  \ blur the lines between what is helpful for humans and what we believe to be empirically\
  \ true about the physical world. I'll provide a couple of hints on how you can discern\
  \ which part of the landscape you're in as you explore topics like the vagus nerve.\
  \ The vagus nerve is fascinating; it's the longest nerve in your body by a significant\
  \ margin. The term 'vagal' comes from roots related to wandering, reminiscent of\
  \ the term 'vagrant.' While I was tempted to mention 'voyage,' it may not be entirely\
  \ appropriate, as it also denotes wandering.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s called the\
  \ wandering nerve. This is where I must choose my images carefully, as many illustrations\
  \ are simplistic and miss crucial details. The vagus nerve starts where the sympathetic\
  \ trunk runs down the spine, connecting at various vertebrae. The vagus nerve emerges\
  \ from the brainstem. While I don't recall specifics, I can guess where it originates\
  \ based on what I've learned. Cranial nerve X structure, I don't know one of the\
  \ cranial nerves. It's one of the cranial nerves, so for you future doctor types,\
  \ you will be forced to look at this list of cranial nerves, which will become very\
  \ familiar to you. The cranial nerves include the optic nerve, which is one of them,\
  \ and the oculomotor nerve, which controls eye movements. It's basically just the\
  \ nerves that control your facial expressions, among others. The vagus nerve is\
  \ one of them; it breaks out of your central nervous system in the cranium and then\
  \ runs down through your body, wrapping around. This is all one neuron and it has\
  \ many parts. With neurons, the long parts are called the axons, and then you have\
  \ dendrites. I'm actually not sure if the dendrites are at the beginning or the\
  \ end, but this is all one long neuron that tends to go down and wrap around a lot\
  \ of the viscera of your body, including your respiratory system and down into the\
  \ gut. When I earlier talked about the enteric nervous system, which is the gut-based\
  \ nervous system, this is its main mode of communication. The primary way that your\
  \ gut communicates with the central nervous system is through the vagus nerve. Similarly,\
  \ I tend to associate the sympathetic trunk with that shocking feeling of being\
  \ surprised. You can think about all the different emotions and feelings that relate\
  \ to sinking feelings in your chest or your guts feeling tied up, like that empty\
  \ feeling in the pit of your stomach. I had a similar reaction when I first saw\
  \ pictures of this; I realized that's where all those feelings come from. If I were\
  \ to point to those feelings, it would be these spaghetti-like cacophonies of parts\
  \ of the vagus nerve. Yes, those are kind of like, obviously, there are many more\
  \ details. So, sorry, I guess there are some parts that come out the bottom too.\
  \ Your vagus nerve has connections that differ from those of the sympathetic system,\
  \ which runs down the spine. The parasympathetic system tends to be associated with\
  \ these long-range connections through the vagus nerve, which are not as connected\
  \ to the musculoskeletal aspects of your body. Earlier, when we were looking at\
  \ the list of different functions and considering the effects of parasympathetic\
  \ activation on various processes and organs as opposed to sympathetic activation,\
  \ this trade-off is thought to be mediated through, what's the word... there's a\
  \ fancy term for this, but it's like a type of activation where one system tends\
  \ to increase while the other decreases. You observe a similar effect in the way\
  \ reflexes trade off during activities like walking. As I walk, my feet cycle through\
  \ stance and swing with a very tight spatiotemporal coupling. As my foot hits the\
  \ ground, my leg muscles have to be stiff and strong enough to support my body weight,\
  \ but the second my foot leaves the ground, they become floppy to swing through\
  \ without expending too much energy. The transition from stance to swing at the\
  \ level of the limbs during locomotion is mediated by the upper levels of your nervous\
  \ system, particularly through the top part of the motor hierarchy. This often involves\
  \ shifting the gain of various low-level reflexes, like the stretch reflex that\
  \ tends to resist motion. The transition from stance to swing at each step is mediated\
  \ at some level by higher brain functions\u2014specifically, I think it's the cerebellum\
  \ in that part of the region\u2014shifting the gain on that low-level stretch reflex.\
  \ A lot of those stance-to-swing transitions occur there. There\u2019s also a similar\
  \ component of reciprocal activation in the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous\
  \ systems that I was trying to discuss. Here, as I mentioned, we could teach several\
  \ classes on the specific anatomy associated with these systems. In terms of high-level,\
  \ broad, cartoonified versions of the story, the main anatomical aspects of the\
  \ sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are associated with the sympathetic\
  \ trunk and the paired ganglia in the sympathetic case. In the parasympathetic sense,\
  \ it's about the vagus nerve wandering through your body. \n\nSo, moving into a\
  \ more functional space, the idea is to look at the transition of your nervous system\
  \ into states associated with fight or flight\u2014high-pressure, low-time-scale,\
  \ leave-it-all-on-the-field types of activation of your sympathetic nervous system.\
  \ In contrast, the parasympathetic system takes over for those longer time scales\
  \ during relaxation and restorative activities. \n\nMost of the rest of this class\
  \ will discuss that transition and your ability to appropriately mediate between\
  \ the different states your body should be in, depending on the condition of the\
  \ world around you. Specifically, I want to begin discussing this in terms of measurable\
  \ aspects. A lot of behavioral research into these areas of the autonomic nervous\
  \ system looks at factors that are typically managed by your autonomic nervous system.\
  \ The primary ones are breathing and heart rate. \n\nFocusing on heart rate, it\
  \ is important because, while breathing is essential for survival, it is also subject\
  \ to voluntary control. Most of the time, your breathing happens automatically,\
  \ but you can choose to hold your breath, inhale, or exhale, enacting some level\
  \ of volitional control. You can hold your breath for a while, though you can't\
  \ do it until you die\u2014just a quick warning: don\u2019t try to pass out by holding\
  \ your breath. \n\nOn the other hand, heart rate is a bit different; it operates\
  \ at a deeper layer in your nervous system. You cannot control your heart rate in\
  \ the same way you control your breath, and you can't control your breath in the\
  \ same way you control your hand. Therefore, heart rate is one layer deeper in your\
  \ nervous system, where you lose that direct volitional control. Examining heart\
  \ rate as a measurement provides a fascinating and valuable window into the status\
  \ and functionality of these systems. that layer of your nervous system control.\
  \ One of the main concepts that comes out is the notion of heart rate variability.\
  \ There is a certain kind of naive, mechanistic thinking about the heart, which\
  \ I believed for quite some time. You would imagine that if you're a doctor assessing\
  \ the health of someone's nervous system, you would look at their heart rate and\
  \ you would look for heart rate variability. You would say heart rate variability\
  \ is good; when it's low, we prefer our heart beats to be very regular, like a metronome,\
  \ and when the variability in timing between beats is low, that's when your heart\
  \ is doing its job very well. However, it turns out that, although this is the case,\
  \ there is a caveat around this. When we think about things like heart rate variability,\
  \ one of the things we look for, as if I were a medical doctor, is there's a healthy\
  \ range of variability that, if you are not showing, that's a sign that something\
  \ is going awry under the hood.\n\nBriefly, if you think about heart rate variability,\
  \ it's literally just measuring the heart rate and then doing statistics on the\
  \ time between beats. This is not just heart rate variability. If anyone has ever\
  \ seen an EKG, which stands for electrocardiogram\u2014don't ask me why it starts\
  \ with a C\u2014it's the timing between these beats that we're thinking of as the\
  \ heartbeat. There are a lot of other things you can say about the other types of\
  \ shapes that are going on here, which is literally below my level of analysis,\
  \ but it's the variability between the actual beats of your heart that we associate\
  \ with heart rate variability.\n\nSo, when we look at those numbers, there is an\
  \ inherent time scale involved because we're talking about the statistics of a timed\
  \ thing. You can imagine that at some point in all of our lives, we will be asked\
  \ by our doctors to wear a heart rate monitor for 48 hours straight. They will measure\
  \ our heartbeat and analyze various aspects of our nervous system through the statistics\
  \ of those heart rates. You can imagine that at the 24-hour time scale, you'll notice\
  \ the effects of the fact that you tend to sleep at night versus walk around during\
  \ the day, leading to variability on that 24-hour scale. Faster for part of the\
  \ day and then slower for another part of the day. But that's not the time, and\
  \ that's an interesting time scale, but that's not the time scale that we're thinking\
  \ about here. The time scale that we tend to associate with this conversation around\
  \ the autonomic nervous system and these trade-offs between the sympathetic and\
  \ parasympathetic nervous systems happens on the scale of breaths. One of the subtle\
  \ aspects of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems is that in a healthy,\
  \ happy, cheerfully functioning nervous system, the trade-off between the sympathetic\
  \ and parasympathetic systems occurs every time you take a breath. Specifically,\
  \ when you inhale, your sympathetic system starts to wake up, and your heart rate\
  \ increases during the inhalation. Then, when you exhale, your parasympathetic system\
  \ takes over, and your heart rate slows down during that part of your breath. It's\
  \ very hard to feel that. At that layer, when I try to cue into my heart rate and\
  \ determine if it's speeding up when I'm inhaling and slowing down when I'm exhaling,\
  \ it's challenging because my ability to be aware of it is about the same as my\
  \ ability to lie to myself about my sensations. So, I really have no idea if I'm\
  \ actually feeling that or if I'm just expecting it. However, I think that whatever\
  \ that personal somatic journey might be, it's easier to do when my heart rate is\
  \ elevated. When I'm exercising and my heart rate is beating fast in general, I\
  \ can often feel that when I inhale, especially if I hold my breath; you can feel\
  \ your heart rate speeding up, and when you exhale, you can feel it slowing down.\
  \ This conversation about heart rate variability ideally happens at the scale of\
  \ your breath. Typically, when you hear people talk about heart rate variability,\
  \ they tend to discuss it on that time scale, not on things like the 24-hour time\
  \ scale or even the multi-hour time scale. Although, if you dig into this a little\
  \ bit, there's plenty for people to say about heart rate variability at those kinds\
  \ of time scales. This is where we get to a bit of jargon. In my previous explorations\
  \ of this area, as far as I can tell, the boundary layer between what I think of\
  \ as legitimate science on this topic versus the less credible science is the boundary\
  \ between neurovisceral integration and polyvagal theory. Talking about polyvagal\
  \ theory, you're probably in two towns. That doesn't mean that it's not useful on\
  \ a personal level, but typically, I think that the term polyvagal is thrown around\
  \ when you start discussing the ventral and dorsal pathways. The ventral does this,\
  \ and the dorsal does that. As far as I can tell, there is no actual scientific\
  \ backing for that anatomical distinction between the different parts of the vagus\
  \ nerve handling different aspects of your regulatory system. So if you come across\
  \ the term polyvagal or dorsal-ventral, it's not to say it's not useful, but just\
  \ know that you are straying from the standard scientific narrative when you enter\
  \ that territory.\n\nNeurovisceral integration model, or neurovisceral theory, is\
  \ a step back from that. It simply states that what we might consider a healthy,\
  \ happy, and well-functioning relationship between a given mammalian nervous system\
  \ and the world at large can be measured and understood as the ability of your nervous\
  \ system to maintain a healthy and comfortable trade-off between different aspects\
  \ of your autonomic nervous system in a smooth and orderly manner. The ability of\
  \ your body to transition from that arousal state associated with sympathetic activation\
  \ and fight-or-flight response into the rest and digest state is key. The ability\
  \ to make those transitions smoothly from one to the other is what we tend to refer\
  \ to as neurovisceral theory. \n\nAt a broader level, this concept involves the\
  \ idea that your neurons\u2014your nervous system, including your central nervous\
  \ system and brain\u2014are connected to your viscera, which includes the lesser\
  \ organs, specifically your heart rate, gut, and lungs. If you doubt this connection,\
  \ just think about something scary and notice how your heart rate increases. There\
  \ is a clear link between the most abstract aspects of your cognitive neural system\
  \ and the lower-level functions necessary for pumping blood and maintaining life.\
  \ Thus, those parts are connected. \n\nIn terms of neurovisceral theory and the\
  \ linguistics surrounding it, when you see two words that are combined, you can\
  \ replace the 'o' with a slash. So, 'neurovisceral' can be interpreted as neural/visceral,\
  \ where 'viscera' refers to the lesser organs. While you might not want to frame\
  \ your understanding of the world in this way, it is a perspective one might consider.\
  \ Now, I am going to move away from the more visceral aspects of neuroscience. into\
  \ the more socio-behavioral parts, speaking specifically about where the trauma\
  \ talk comes in. I will try to thread various lines there. One of the main points,\
  \ roughly on the timeline of my entry into neuroscience, is that it has become much\
  \ more prevalent these days. One of the ways we have started to think about the\
  \ nervous system, the role of your central nervous system, and the question of why\
  \ we have a brain and a spinal cord, is that there is more and more belief that\
  \ mostly what your nervous system is doing is predicting the future. This is what\
  \ your cognitive, neural, and central nervous systems are primarily for. Your job\
  \ as an organism, as a creature, as a human, as a cognitive agent, is to predict\
  \ the future based on noisy, out-of-date information about the current state of\
  \ the world, combined with your memories and histories, and the lessons learned\
  \ from previous interactions. This applies across pretty much all time scales. \n\
  \nTake the classic example of throwing a ball and catching it. My senses are the\
  \ fastest way that I receive information from the world, and arguably the only way\
  \ I get information from the world. However, even when I have a sensory experience,\
  \ it is always something that has happened after the fact. Sensory information occurs\
  \ after the event in question has taken place. Using that information, which is\
  \ noisy and abstracted, I can make predictions based on my extensive and varied\
  \ previous experiences interacting with the world. With the sensations I feel in\
  \ my hand, coupled with the flashes of light I\u2019m getting from my eyes, I can\
  \ say to myself, based on my predictions, that if I send this series of motor commands\
  \ to my arm, it will hit the target as I expect, and the ball will land in my hand.\
  \ You can observe this kind of predictive behavior when looking at babies trying\
  \ to navigate and interact with their world. Particularly when they are very young,\
  \ they tend to exhibit random movements, and there is this kind of tripping aspect\
  \ to their behavior. Yet sometimes, they achieve something that is surprising, and\
  \ it works. So, the way that our... The nervous system works, especially at that\
  \ sort of developmental layer, when we make a prediction. When that works out like\
  \ we expected it to, or like we wanted it to, there is a reinforcement that occurs.\
  \ We want to talk about the goop again; it's thought to be associated with the dopaminergic\
  \ system. If I am pretty sure that if I do this with my body, I'll get the outcome\
  \ that I want, and then I achieve that outcome, there's a dopaminergic release.\
  \ Your literal dopaminergic response is the generation of dopamine, so it releases\
  \ these chemicals into your nervous system that effectively reinforce whatever just\
  \ happened because it was good. We want to reinforce that those neurons should be\
  \ connected in that way because it leads to results that I like in my life. \n\n\
  This introduces the concept of valence. Valence is essentially a root of value;\
  \ it's like a thumbs up or a thumbs down. Good valence things are generally good,\
  \ while bad valence things are generally bad. For example, if I reach out to touch\
  \ something and it has razor blades in it and I get cut, I don\u2019t like that\u2014\
  that's bad. Similarly, if I fire 15 milliseconds too late and I miss the target\
  \ and drop it, that\u2019s a negative valence. \n\nIt\u2019s useful to think about\
  \ this concept because I am not discussing scale. A valence of -0.1 is negative\
  \ in the same way that -150,000 is negative, and -0.1 is positive; -1000 is negative.\
  \ The valence there is not a measure of the scale. \n\nThere\u2019s a relationship\
  \ between making a prediction about the world and whether that prediction works\
  \ out in the way we wanted, which defines whether our nervous system thinks, \"\
  That was great, let's do more of that,\" or, \"That was bad, I didn't like that\
  \ outcome.\" When we make bad predictions, it means we made mistakes; errors occurred\
  \ in the calculation, and we need to correct for those things at some level. \n\n\
  So, there\u2019s a central concept of prediction, and then this other concept of\
  \ the outcome of those predictions, which determines how the nervous system will\
  \ organize itself. \n\nI realize I may have put that out of order, but let\u2019\
  s proceed. How are we doing on time? I think I forgot to put this in, so I'm not\
  \ exactly sure about the order of operations here. One of the things I've really\
  \ noticed very recently is that the concept of your nervous system is mostly about...\
  \ Prediction has been in the perceptual motor literature for quite some time. It\
  \ was already a bit old hat by the time I started grad school. I have started seeing\
  \ that same kind of thinking coming into the way we tend to think of emotions and\
  \ the aspect of our nervous system related to them. We tend, I think naively, to\
  \ think of emotions as if they were sensations and reactions to the way the world\
  \ presents itself to us. While there is some aspect where this is true, such as\
  \ an alligator coming out of the water being scary and making me feel fear, there's\
  \ also a predictive aspect of that emotion. I feel fear from that thing because\
  \ I think it will hurt me. I feel happy when I see cake because I think I'm going\
  \ to eat it. This leads to an interesting way of thinking about our emotional responses\
  \ to the world, as being less about immediate reactions to the state of the world\
  \ and more about a vague prediction regarding what the available information means\
  \ down the line, at some time scale, possibly quick, possibly slow, and what I should\
  \ do as a result of that. With the alligator coming at me, I have to respond very\
  \ quickly, but with the cake, I can take my time. Typically, when we think about\
  \ the emotional parts of our brain, where emotions come from, we're talking about\
  \ things like the amygdala and other subcortical regions that are closer to the\
  \ brain stem than to the cortex. Often, emotions occur at the neurophysiological\
  \ level in the form of chemical releases; some chemical gets dumped into the system\
  \ that we associate with different emotions. Many antidepressants and other pharmaceuticals\
  \ operate by either stimulating the release of these chemicals\u2014you're consuming\
  \ that chemical, so there\u2019s more of it floating around that regulates your\
  \ emotions\u2014or by asking your body to release those chemicals into your brain.\
  \ For example, MDMA works by prompting your brain to release all your happy chemicals,\
  \ allowing people to feel happy. However, they also tend to feel sad afterward because\
  \ they have dumped all their happy chemicals and need to wait to replenish them.\
  \ This is where we... I sort of started getting into the trauma talk of the day.\
  \ If you think about it, this is a combination of many factors, particularly the\
  \ autonomic nervous system and the trade-offs of its different parts. One aspect\
  \ of the nervous system\u2019s main job is to predict the state of the future. This\
  \ is where we encounter traumatic events\u2014places where things happen that you\
  \ did not like. Such events can lead to asynchronies between your autonomic nervous\
  \ system and breakdowns of what we call the neurovisual integration theory, which\
  \ posits that a happy and healthy state depends on your autonomic nervous system's\
  \ ability to appropriately switch between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous\
  \ systems. You can think of this as the ability to relax when it\u2019s time to\
  \ relax because we typically don't have a problem with the other part. Now, before\
  \ we delve deeper into psychological spaces, I want to talk about PTSD, the acronym\
  \ we associate with post-traumatic stress disorder. The term 'post' means after\
  \ a traumatic event, which leads to a stress disorder. I specifically want to discuss\
  \ the term 'disorder' in the context of the concept of 'vigilance.' A disorder occurs\
  \ anytime things obstruct your ability to live the life you want to live. In discussing\
  \ this topic, you will see a variety of conversations informed by empirical research,\
  \ and also hear a lot in casual environments. Sometimes, you might hear people try\
  \ to distinguish between 'capital T trauma' and 'lowercase T trauma,' where lowercase\
  \ T trauma might refer to a minor inconvenience, like burning your lip on a hot\
  \ cup of coffee, while capital T trauma involves serious events, such as being in\
  \ a car accident that instills a fear of cars. I understand why some people feel\
  \ upset when others might seem to be watering down these important concepts by discussing\
  \ everyday challenges alongside much more serious issues like PTSD, which can be\
  \ very debilitating for people's lives. I think this concern is valid, but as we\u2019\
  ve discussed, nature operates on gradients and shades of gray, and where we choose\
  \ to draw the line between these experiences is complex and nuanced. Just normal\
  \ relationships to the world, like, sorry kid, them's the breaks. It gets tough;\
  \ that's the world. Those are the healthy parts of stress that help you interact\
  \ with the world in a productive and effective way for yourself. I think I'm less\
  \ interested in trying to figure out exactly where to draw that line and more interested\
  \ in helping people know how to draw that line in ways that are appropriate for\
  \ themselves. That's why I want to think about the term \"disorder\" as less of\
  \ a thing you find in the DSM-5\u2014or maybe the DSM-6 now\u2014and more as something\
  \ you get to choose. Is this something that is getting in the way of my ability\
  \ to live my life as I want to, or is this just learning important life lessons\
  \ and having the accrual of experiences that we eventually call wisdom? So, it's\
  \ up to you.\n\nSpecifically, I think that when we think of disorder, it\u2019s\
  \ often as if the gears of the machine have slipped in some way. Then the things\
  \ that would normally operate as they should can\u2019t, because something is stuck.\
  \ That\u2019s what we consider disorders like PTSD. I\u2019m also going to make\
  \ a distinction here between PTSD and what we tend to think of as trauma, which\
  \ is generally something really bad happened, and now I\u2019m having a hard time\
  \ interacting with the world. Typically, it\u2019s one really bad thing that happened\u2014\
  think of a car accident. It\u2019s a bad event where you had a very scary experience\
  \ or came close to serious injury, and now it\u2019s affecting your ability to interact\
  \ with the world. I would call that acute trauma\u2014one big bad thing, not \"\
  cute\" but \"acute.\"\n\nThis is distinct from a more subtle, newer way of thinking\
  \ about PTSD, which we call complex PTSD. This is a different type of behavior we\
  \ tend to associate with living in a world that has general, long-term exposure\
  \ to an unsafe environment. It\u2019s less about one big car accident and more about\
  \ living in a context of low-grade child abuse or in food-insecure environments\
  \ where, as a child, you can\u2019t always get food when you\u2019re hungry. There\u2019\
  s no one big thing that stands out as bad enough to warrant, \"Oh yeah, this was\
  \ the event I\u2019m dealing with.\" It\u2019s more about living in that constant\
  \ state of insecurity. Long-term, there can be a low-grade harm that pervades everything.\
  \ I don't know if you can think of any people or groups who might experience the\
  \ world as generally unsafe, filled with small sub-threshold traumas that never\
  \ quite reach the point where you can label them specifically. Nonetheless, these\
  \ experiences become integrated into the way you view the world. I can't think of\
  \ any examples, but maybe you can. \n\nI want to give a quick shout-out to some\
  \ popular books that have been the starting point of my exploration into this space.\
  \ A classic one is \"The Body Keeps the Score\" by Bessel van der Kolk. Although\
  \ it doesn't clearly make a distinction between acute PTSD and complex PTSD, it\
  \ focuses on acute PTSD. Van der Kolk was one of the authors who helped define PTSD\
  \ in the DSM and brought it into common vernacular. This book has received criticism,\
  \ which I think is justified, mainly because it is not written in a trauma-informed\
  \ way. It discusses traumatic experiences in a graphic manner, making it hard to\
  \ recommend to those who have experienced significant trauma. While it is not terrible,\
  \ the complaints are reasonable. The writing can also be very dry and academic;\
  \ it is dense with information, which is good, but I still include these caveats\
  \ when recommending it. \n\nAdditionally, I've heard that Van der Kolk has had some\
  \ troubling behavior, although I don't know the specifics. Still, books stand on\
  \ their own. The one I tend to recommend first is \"What My Bones Know\" by Stephanie\
  \ Fu. Fu grew up in an abusive environment and later became a journalist. Her book\
  \ is much more focused on her journey to understanding complex PTSD and the various\
  \ treatments she pursued, integrating these experiences into her life. It is less\
  \ information-dense and feels more modern and aware. However, it is important to\
  \ note that Fu's book discusses complex PTSD more specifically, while \"The Body\
  \ Keeps the Score\" primarily focuses on PTSD and does not clearly distinguish between\
  \ the two. In the context of the kind of topics we've been discussing, if we consider\
  \ the role of your nervous system as primarily about predicting the future and integrating\
  \ information and experiences, it helps us understand the state of the world and\
  \ the appropriate behaviors we should adopt in response to it. You can see how significant\
  \ traumatic events, or even low-grade, long-term traumatic experiences, can lead\
  \ to a sort of slipping of the gears in the ability of your body to transition appropriately\
  \ between the fight or flight state, governed by the sympathetic nervous system,\
  \ and the rest and relaxation state, governed by the parasympathetic nervous system.\
  \ Our body, including the nervous system, central nervous system, peripheral nervous\
  \ system, and autonomic nervous system, is very sensitive to the outcomes of our\
  \ predictions. Humans, in general, tend to be far more risk-averse than we are reward-seeking.\
  \ For example, if you ask someone whether they would prefer $10 or a 10% chance\
  \ of winning $10,000, numerically, those offers are equivalent; however, we overwhelmingly\
  \ prefer the $10 due to our risk aversion. I like to say that it would be a rather\
  \ ineffective visual system if it gave equal weight to everything in your visual\
  \ field, noticing non-threats at the same level as real threats like tigers. Because\
  \ of our risk-averse nature, we tend to overweight negative experiences when figuring\
  \ out how we should interact with the world. For instance, if you find yourself\
  \ in a car accident or face a choice between two doors\u2014one blue and one green\u2014\
  after you open the green door and get punched in the face, while opening the blue\
  \ door brings you cake and candy, your nervous system will evaluate whether the\
  \ predictions we made were good. If the prediction was correct, we should reinforce\
  \ it; if it was incorrect and led to harm or danger, your body will begin to look\
  \ for missed signs and things you should have noticed. This process helps us realize,\
  \ 'Oh, I should have noticed that.' That car was turning. I should have noticed\
  \ that the door was green, and green means people are going to punch you when you\
  \ open the door. I don't know what that is. What can happen is what we tend to call\
  \ hypervigilance, where you sort of cue often times. What happens because the world\
  \ is cruel and capricious is that there wasn't a thing you could have noticed, or\
  \ at least not something you really should have noticed, given your experience.\n\
  \nSo, what will happen is your body will just reach out for stuff. Sometimes, the\
  \ lesson that your nervous system might learn is that I let my guard down and that\
  \ was the mistake. This can lead to a kind of dysregulation of the nervous system,\
  \ where your body might associate being in a state of calm and relaxed, especially\
  \ if you're around other people, especially in an environment that, I don't know,\
  \ is available for danger.\n\nThe sympathetic nervous system might be unwilling\
  \ to give up that reactivity at times when it needs to, and it's thought that you\
  \ could sort of measure that in terms of heart rate variability. If you measure\
  \ someone's heart rate and look for those transitions of high speed versus low speed\
  \ heart rates on the scale of breaths, you might not see that because the sympathetic\
  \ nervous system is holding on too tight, and the parasympathetic system doesn't\
  \ get the chance to do the slowing down that's supposed to happen.\n\nYou can imagine\
  \ how that same type of difficulty in trading off between high state arousal versus\
  \ low state relaxation could lead to problems in general health. Think about your\
  \ gut doing its job, being able to sleep through the night, and being able to interact\
  \ with people around you and let your guard down. Those are where a lot of the good\
  \ parts of life tend to come from. \n\nSo, that hypervigilance can be one of the\
  \ consequences of traumatic experiences. From the perspective of people who care\
  \ about humans having happy lives, the question then becomes: if that happens, and\
  \ when it happens, because unfortunately the world is rough and we will encounter\
  \ difficulties, how do we try to bring things back to baseline? What might work\
  \ there? \n\nI also want to mention, because I'm running out of time, that we're\
  \ on a good path. However, I wanted to point out another concept, which I won't\
  \ talk much about, which is the concept of resilience. The fact is that not everybody\
  \ who has a negative experience results in negative outcomes. Disordered autonomic\
  \ regulation involves various experiences, and some people are able to bounce back.\
  \ What defines or helps us differentiate one from the other is often a question\
  \ of baseline\u2014how many experiences have you had that show you it is safe to\
  \ relax and put your guard down? Additionally, how likely are you to have experienced\
  \ situations where that\u2019s not the case? If you consider this in terms of your\
  \ life and your development, it highlights why it is so crucial to protect children\
  \ and teach them that they can let their guard down.\n\nThink about the analogy\
  \ of the blue versus green door. If you have a lifetime of experience with doors\
  \ of all colors, and you open a green one and get punched in the face, you\u2019\
  ve opened enough green doors that you know it\u2019s not the door that\u2019s the\
  \ problem; it\u2019s just that one specific instance. But if you\u2019ve just started\
  \ opening doors in your life with no prior experience, and you open a green door\
  \ and get hit, then for the rest of your life, 100% of your experiences lead you\
  \ to believe that green doors are unsafe. This might develop into a lifelong aversion\
  \ to green doors even when it\u2019s not warranted.\n\nOne key takeaway from the\
  \ literature, particularly discussed in \"The Body Keeps the Score,\" is how critical\
  \ it is for us to ensure that young children have experiences of safety and comfort\
  \ during their early years. The long-term consequences and effects of early adverse\
  \ experiences are not insurmountable; children who face bad experiences are not\
  \ doomed. However, those early effects will weigh more heavily than later experiences\
  \ because, in that early phase of life, you have fewer experiences to draw upon.\n\
  \nThere\u2019s also the idea that the world we deserve, optimistically, can only\
  \ be achieved if we have three consecutive generations where every child gets to\
  \ experience stability, comfort, and care for the first 18 years of their life.\
  \ This is due to factors like epigenetics. Lastly, I want to mention that the disordered\
  \ hypervigilance response creates a sense that nothing is safe. When you are in\
  \ this state, you feel as though the world isn\u2019t safe and that you cannot let\
  \ your guard down or appropriately rest and relax. In extreme cases, this can lead\
  \ to a perpetual state of distress. In the case of interpersonal trauma, which unfortunately\
  \ is quite common, you can experience difficulty being calm and relaxed around other\
  \ people. This is both an understandable response and something that can be really\
  \ diminishing for your ability to live a happy and healthy life. I would say effective,\
  \ rather than productive, because productivity is tied to capitalism, while effectiveness\
  \ relates more to internal motivation. \n\nAlthough this is outside my field, and\
  \ I am certainly not a therapist or counselor, I find it interesting that many treatments\
  \ and therapies aimed at helping people get their lives back in sync often share\
  \ common elements. These tasks cut across the full hierarchy of the nervous system\
  \ and aim to engage your voluntary control systems regarding parts of your body\
  \ and nervous system at the most basic levels. You can't just decide to speed up\
  \ or slow down your heart rate, but you can decide to hold your breath or take long,\
  \ slow breaths. \n\nThere is this concept called the physiological sigh, which I\
  \ believe is legitimate. I don't know if it is associated with Dan Huberman, who\
  \ appears to be a reputable scientist, but I see him too often to fully trust him.\
  \ Nevertheless, his research reflects something you can observe in your own life\
  \ and in others. It involves that feeling of taking an extra breath followed by\
  \ a deep sigh, which has empirical support and can act as a reset for your body\u2014\
  especially when you're in an aroused or heightened state. Subsequently, it can help\
  \ release tension and promote relaxation.\n\nEvery time you experience this, I encourage\
  \ you to ask yourself why you were feeling heightened in the first place. Consider\
  \ what was happening at that moment, and once you have moved past that point, reflect\
  \ on what you can take away from it. This leads to exploring the boundaries between\
  \ benevolent interactions among humans and Machiavellian tendencies in social cues.\
  \ If you ever find yourself in an argument or difficult conversation, try not to\
  \ get too angry or upset. Take a moment to pause and notice the dynamics at play.\
  \ How others respond can be revealing, and recognizing this is essential in navigating\
  \ such interactions. That's when you can engage more empathetically with the person\
  \ because they have hypothetically just left that high arousal state and sort of\
  \ entered into a more restful, relaxed kind of space. You can game it; you can cheat\
  \ yourself because your nervous system, your body, your internal systems are brilliant.\
  \ However, like most things that are brilliant, they're also dumb as hell. Your\
  \ body, mind, and brain can lie to you; they can trick you and say things that are\
  \ wrong. But you can counter that by lying just as hard to yourself, because you\
  \ can. If you're trying to get yourself to relax\u2014and we know that breathing\
  \ in tends to ramp up the sympathetic nervous system while breathing out tends to\
  \ ramp up the parasympathetic\u2014just take a quick breath, breathe in quickly,\
  \ and then exhale slowly. You're essentially gaming the system there. \n\nI also\
  \ have a personal fascination with eye movements in this conversation. As we've\
  \ discussed many times throughout this semester, our breathing is on the boundary\
  \ of volitional versus autonomic control. Our eye movements are in a similar kind\
  \ of space. You make tens of thousands of eye movements every day, the vast majority\
  \ of which are not volitionally controlled. It's just your central nervous system\
  \ grabbing visual information from the places that some lower region of your nervous\
  \ system wanted the information from. We can control that, though not all the time.\
  \ With some effort, we can grab that handle and control things. \n\nThere are treatments\
  \ like EMDR, which stands for Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, that\
  \ involve making patterned eye movements, like back and forth, as a way to take\
  \ some control back over your central nervous system. Additionally, therapies often\
  \ emphasize naming and noticing emotions, which you'll see in somatic therapies.\
  \ It's about naming the emotion and pointing to it in your body, engaging the linguistic\
  \ parts of your brain\u2014the most abstract, non-biological parts that exist. Putting\
  \ a name on a feeling is like reaching across eons of the phylogenetic tree. Many\
  \ therapies have that nature of reaching from the top down to the bottom and resting\
  \ control that way. \n\nIn the last two minutes, I want to think about this in terms\
  \ of having a body, having a nervous system, and living in this strange meat puppet\
  \ that has all these... Different systems trade off against each other. Some of\
  \ these can be influenced and controlled, while others cannot. Thinking about it\
  \ in the context of my experiences with pets\u2014like dogs and cats\u2014cats are\
  \ kind of like having strange alien roommates who live and operate in the same space.\
  \ We like each other, but we can't really communicate in the same way. I think there\
  \ are parts of your nervous system, like your gut, that feel similar. It's present,\
  \ and you can operate in a way that elicits certain behaviors, but you can't directly\
  \ control it, in the same way that you can control your muscular system or eye movements.\n\
  \nDogs, on the other hand, are more like an externalized aspect of your nervous\
  \ system. They actively look to you to determine how they should behave, allowing\
  \ you to control their behavior more directly. They are independent beings, but\
  \ you can say, \"calm down,\" or pet them, and if they bark, they look at you. This\
  \ creates a much more directed form of communication with that externalized nervous\
  \ system compared to that of a cat.\n\nThere's this concept in neuroscience known\
  \ as the homunculus. The homunculus is the naive feeling that you are in a little\
  \ driver's seat in your brain, observing and exerting some control over your body.\
  \ However, that idea doesn't hold up; there isn't a smaller piece inside you\u2014\
  a little person in your brain\u2014doing that. Instead, it's simply the system observing\
  \ itself, and this kind of interaction is philosophically profound.\n\nIn the last\
  \ few seconds, I want to mention Wittgenstein, a philosopher of language who was\
  \ one of the progenitors of modern theories of the philosophy of science. He discussed\
  \ the impossibility of language and the challenge of conveying human thought through\
  \ language, highlighting the sad reality that we can never fully express a thought;\
  \ we can only approximate it over time. He described this idea with a beetle in\
  \ a box. Imagine I have this box containing a beetle. I can describe the beetle's\
  \ characteristics\u2014it can be green with little things on its head\u2014and I\
  \ could talk about it for a thousand years, but you'll never be able to actually\
  \ see it. You won't get the same picture of the beetle that you would if I could\
  \ show it to you, but I can't. In the same way that nobody else can ever see the\
  \ beetle in your box, you can never see the box itself. I think that to really engage\
  \ in the strange and possibly impossible task of knowing yourself and understanding\
  \ your body, it's a combination of being able to describe your internal state. However,\
  \ it also involves listening, hearing, and seeking help to get the full picture,\
  \ which you can never fully achieve from a first-person perspective, as that is\
  \ all we really have. If you\u2019re going to be doomed to push an impossible boulder\
  \ up a hill forever, you might as well have company. That\u2019s it. Thanks for\
  \ the class. Have a good break, and I will see you."

  text: 'Okay, hello everybody, settle down. Welcome to this Bonus Week, and thank
    you for showing up. Because this class doesn''t have a class the first week of
    the semester, and the semester starts on Wednesday, it''s like this weird little
    half-week that is kind of part of that. I appreciate you showing up. If you''re
    watching this on a video and didn''t show up, I understand.


    So, the cadence of the semester has actually been working out pretty nicely. Last
    time, we had the fun little walkthrough of my prior research experience, providing
    a hypothetically sufficient background to cover it. Now, this is the second-to-last
    class of the semester. It''s kind of a little bit of a bonus lecture.


    This time, I''m going to talk about your autonomic nervous system, particularly
    as it relates to trauma and the neurophysiological effects of trauma on the body.
    We will explore the ways that this interacts and overlaps with all the things
    we''ve been learning this semester about how bodies work and the balancing act
    we have between the parts of our bodies and nervous system that we have theoretically
    direct access and control over, and the parts that are more like the ocean we
    float on top of. We''ll discuss how these elements play into each other.


    Next week will be the final class of the semester; there is no proper final, so
    I will spend that time doing a wrap-up and presenting my class project. This project
    aims to make sense of the tremendous amount of input you''ve provided into the
    server. I''ll create an official assignment on Canvas about what to do to wrap
    up your efforts here.


    I will probably spend Thanksgiving adding a few extra features to the bot and
    some of the visualizations I''ve been showing throughout the semester. There will
    be some assignment that will look something like this: make sure you''ve had at
    least this many chats here and there. Additionally, there will be an exit interview-type
    conversation where you''ll talk to the bot. At that point, I hope to have a way
    of extracting your specific conversations and incorporating them into the conversation,
    so you can discuss with the bot about your experiences and insights.'

  text: 'The semester went, and what you discovered and found will be fun to look
    at. So, let''s get into this. I dropped a link to the sloppy notes that I have
    on the GitHub page, and I will try to go through this in a structured way. This
    area of neuroscience, at the autonomic level, is not something that I have direct
    professional experience in. A lot of the stuff we have been talking about this
    semester is on the perceptual motor side of life, such as eye movements, motion
    capture, and that kind of biomechanic stuff. That is an area in which I consider
    myself a contributing expert, and I have a solid awareness of the field, in terms
    of knowing the literature and understanding the methods, as well as being steeped
    in the culture of people who research that type of thing.


    However, this topic is getting closer to areas where I don''t share the same relationship.
    I do know a lot about it in various ways, but my knowledge stems from what we
    might consider the concept of an intelligent layperson. This is someone who isn''t
    a professional expert in a field but is a smart person who has looked into it
    and read about it. Much scientific writing intentionally targets this intelligent
    layperson audience. I have read some books about this topic, but I haven''t conducted
    extensive research or engaged in direct research in the area.


    Interestingly, because of my background, the popular science type of literature
    that I enjoy connects with the domains where I do possess deeper knowledge. As
    you can watch throughout the lecture, you''ll see how the topics we have discussed
    intersect. It''s intriguing for me to examine the gaps in knowledge that I experience
    as an outsider while also recognizing that my unique perspective might contribute
    to this area in meaningful ways.'

  text: "So, let's get into it. Let's talk about your various nervous systems. You\
    \ have one main one, which is roughly speaking your entire body. There are several\
    \ other delineations of your nervous system, and the ones we tend to discuss the\
    \ most in the field of neuroscience are the central nervous system and the peripheral\
    \ nervous system. \n\nThe central nervous system is what you typically think about\
    \ in neuroscience. Specifically, it comprises the brain, which we refer to as\
    \ the cortex, and it's this large, lumpy pink structure on top. The peripheral\
    \ nervous system is the other side of that. The central nervous system includes\
    \ the cortex, which is the pink, wrinkly part on top, and it also includes the\
    \ subcortical regions, like the cerebellum at the back, as well as areas like\
    \ the basal ganglia and thalamus, which are wrapped inside the big pink wrinkly\
    \ part. It also includes your spine and similar structures.\n\nThe basic functional\
    \ delineation we use for the central nervous system is that it is the area where\
    \ processing occurs. This is where information that has come in through the senses\
    \ is manipulated and transformed into the basis for motor behavior or action.\
    \ However, this distinction, like everything else here, is a simplified version\
    \ of reality. It serves as a reasonable way to categorize things, but there are\
    \ all sorts of overlaps and gray areas, as nature often exhibits.\n\nThis is particularly\
    \ true in areas like the eye, such as in your retina, or in the complex array\
    \ of sensors on your skin. These parts of the nervous system would typically be\
    \ considered part of the peripheral nervous system, dealing with sensory and motor\
    \ aspects. Yet, they perform functions that resemble computations. The immediate\
    \ distinction between the central and peripheral nervous systems can be illustrated\
    \ simply, where the central nervous system resembles a charming little off-center\
    \ brain shape along with the spinal cord, while the peripheral nervous system\
    \ is often thought of as just the wiring that brings sensory information from\
    \ the external environment."

  text: "parts of your body into the central nervous system and the sort of flip-flopped\
    \ wires that send motor commands from the central nervous system out to the periphery.\
    \ This is the sort of cartoon version that you will often see in textbooks. It's\
    \ not incorrect; it\u2019s not a bad way to describe things, but it's inherently\
    \ incomplete and cartoonified, in the way that we often do when we try to parse\
    \ nature, which, as we've discussed in many ways on many days, is sort of an impossible\
    \ thing to do. So first is the peripheral nervous system\u2014that's mostly what\
    \ we've been talking about here\u2014and that kind of basic distinction is there.\
    \ However, there are other sub-distinctions that we can make into other aspects\
    \ of the different nerve groups that we find in the body. Generally speaking,\
    \ neuroscience is the science of neurons, and your neurons sit in these different\
    \ functional roles in your body. I\u2019m realizing that even this distinction\
    \ that I'm about to make is also kind of a flipped or chopped up version of reality.\
    \ When I sat down to write these notes, I thought of the central nervous system,\
    \ the peripheral nervous system, the enteric nervous system, and the autonomic\
    \ nervous system. But I realized that those could arguably be thought of as four\
    \ distinct things, or you could consider them to be subcategories of the two categories\
    \ I just mentioned. You could also say language is incomplete, and we name things\
    \ as they are useful to us. Broadly speaking, the central nervous system is like\
    \ the central processor and the main computational aspect of your neurons, while\
    \ the peripheral nervous system consists of sensory and motor components. The\
    \ enteric nervous system, which is a term I learned this morning, is the fancy\
    \ term for your gut, which is one of those areas that I remember, when I started\
    \ in grad school around 2008, people began to really understand that your gut\
    \ is essentially its own entity. There\u2019s a lot going on in the way that the\
    \ nerves are connected and how decisions are made regarding when various tubes\
    \ will start doing peristalsis and which gland should secrete what into which\
    \ area at which time. Not to mention, the whole microbiome that\u2019s present\
    \ plays a critical role. As the complexity of that gut nervous system has gradually\
    \ become more apparent in the scientific research community, it has been percolating\
    \ out into the general understanding as well."

  text: "In the world at large, all the things you're seeing about gut health and\
    \ your microbiome are kind of right on schedule. They are showing up about a decade\
    \ after they started to emerge in the scientific literature. We don't have as\
    \ much to say about the enteric nervous system, but it will come back into the\
    \ conversation because it interacts with the autonomic nervous system in a way\
    \ that's interesting. We'll talk about that sort of towards the bottom. The last\
    \ bit, the star of the show today, is your autonomic nervous system. The prefix\
    \ 'auto' refers to the root of automatic. Your autonomic nervous system is the\
    \ part of your nervous system that handles the basics, the essential functions\
    \ that keep you alive. It's the low-level system that addresses what you need\
    \ to survive as an individual organism and as a species. I mentioned at some point\
    \ that the nervous system, particularly in the central area, could be argued by\
    \ some to be distinct from the enteric nervous system, possibly as a subcomponent\
    \ of the peripheral nervous system. Who knows if they would be able to defend\
    \ that position to relevant experts, but those who like to categorize would place\
    \ the autonomic nervous system as a subcomponent of the central nervous system.\
    \ There\u2019s a distinction to consider. Often, when you look at the brain and\
    \ the central nervous system, you can kind of get a map of the evolutionary history\
    \ of that part of the nervous system by examining it from the inside out. The\
    \ innermost part of your nervous system is typically the oldest. As you go outward,\
    \ like the layers of an onion or a flower, the outer edges tend to be the most\
    \ recently developed. The neocerebellum, which is sometimes referred to as the\
    \ new part of the cerebellum, is also known as the neocortex, the new part of\
    \ the cortex. A similar story is true on a smaller scale, in terms of volume,\
    \ but on a larger scale in terms of the number of neurons at the cerebellum level.\
    \ There\u2019s a similar distinction where the middle parts are the oldest, and\
    \ as you move outward, you encounter the more phylogenetically new parts. Then\
    \ the outside is the neocerebellum, which is thought to be associated with tool\
    \ use and similar functions."

  text: "The really fine motor control that we are good at is closely related to the\
    \ autonomic nervous system. We are referring to the inner parts, the deep structures\
    \ like the brainstem and the medulla oblongata. If you think of your central controller,\
    \ it resembles a fist; the fist represents your spine coming down, with the deeper\
    \ subcortical regions residing at the top. These areas are among the oldest parts\
    \ of our nervous system. The cortex has been described as the flower on top of\
    \ the bush. If you picture a rosebush, there is this beautiful red flower on top,\
    \ and we spend a lot of time focusing on that flower. However, when you examine\
    \ the plant, the majority of it is bush, with the flower being merely a fascinating\
    \ aspect. Strictly speaking, that bush could still function normally without the\
    \ rose, except for reproducing more bushes. My botanical knowledge might not be\
    \ very strong here. This is also where you'll often hear discussions about the\
    \ mammalian brain versus the reptilian brain. The pink, wrinkled cortex is associated\
    \ with the mammalian parts, while the deeper regions are more connected to the\
    \ reptilian aspects, as those evolved much earlier. Most of our vertebrate friends,\
    \ who share basic functionalities such as having a heart and a nervous system,\
    \ have a centralized set of neurons that control most bodily functions. This contrasts\
    \ with insects or cephalopods like octopuses, which have a more distributed nervous\
    \ system. In their systems, there isn't the same distinction between a concentrated\
    \ area of important parts and a more diffuse set of responsibilities in the periphery.\
    \ All of our vertebrate friends, especially tetrapods\u2014those with two arms\
    \ and two legs\u2014share a similar structure, which marks the terminus of the\
    \ spinal cord. Our chordate friends exhibit a similar shape in this regard. The\
    \ autonomic nervous system manages the basic needs and functions."

  text: "For survival, it is at this point that I get to make a joke that all neuroscience\
    \ professors are required to make in undergraduate classrooms. The autonomic nervous\
    \ system handles the four Fs of survival: feeding, fighting, fleeing, and procreation.\
    \ This is the classic joke. The basic idea is that these are the things you need\
    \ to be able to do; you need to be able to eat food, fight when necessary, run\
    \ away when necessary, and then engage in the complex behaviors that help proliferate\
    \ the species. The autonomic nervous system is thought to handle a lot of that.\n\
    \nAs we break things down into increasingly small categories, your autonomic nervous\
    \ system can be considered to involve two main aspects. Even though I do a lot\
    \ of searching for images related to these topics, which sometimes feels a little\
    \ lazy, I find it helpful to show the process. It allows us to see the different\
    \ types of cartoons and images that we use to discuss these concepts. Some images\
    \ have greater or lesser detail, and some have more or less resemblance to what\
    \ you might actually observe if you were to take an organism, dissect it, and\
    \ take pictures. Others are much more cartoonified.\n\nIt is important to notice\
    \ that all of these images are cartoons. None of them are accurate representations,\
    \ and none will show you what you would see if you cut open any actual human,\
    \ nor do they represent what you would see if you cut open all possible humans,\
    \ which I don't recommend doing either. We tend to have this fiction that these\
    \ pictures somehow represent reality, but really, they represent the best approximation\
    \ we have for carving up reality into conceptual boxes that are simple enough\
    \ for us to understand.\n\nFor example, this cartoon of the brain has fewer details\
    \ than that cartoon of the brain, but they're both cartoons and both impose false\
    \ separations. This part is colored one way, that part is colored another. We\
    \ call this part the parietal lobe and that part the occipital lobe, and we don\u2019\
    t choose these colors randomly. They help us categorize and understand the brain's\
    \ structure, even if simplistically."

    \ open the brain and see a stamp that said, \"This is the parietal lobe.\" We\
    \ discovered that if we call this thing a certain name, then we can say things\
    \ about the whole region, which tends to be more accurate than if we talked about\
    \ a different part of the brain. For example, the occipital lobe is where the\
    \ visual cortex resides. When we talk about vision, we're primarily referring\
    \ to this area. However, you won't find visual functions exclusively in this part\
    \ of the nervous system; you absolutely will find them in other areas as well.\
    \ \n\nThere will be a particular search that shows a stark distinction between\
    \ scientific concepts and what might be considered \"woo woo\" stuff. Much of\
    \ what we discuss will touch on the boundary between proper science\u2014which\
    \ I wouldn't recommend\u2014and popular conceptions of science, as well as what\
    \ we might call pseudoscience. Pseudoscience does not align with our scientific\
    \ understanding in the way that we would expect popular science to do. For instance,\
    \ I would argue that undergraduate textbooks on neuroscience exist on the edge\
    \ of popular science, as they present simplified versions of the story for people\
    \ who do not have a strong background in the field. These textbooks do not convey\
    \ the complexity and chaos of professional scientific work; instead, they start\
    \ with different layers of simplification and then gradually guide students towards\
    \ a more realistic understanding of the world, which is much more chaotic and\
    \ mixed up.\n\nNow, regarding the autonomic nervous system, it has two main branches,\
    \ which we refer to as the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. These\
    \ are again simplifications. On one side, you have the fight or flight aspects,\
    \ associated with high speed and high arousal states necessary for survival in\
    \ a world where predation has evolved. On the other side, the parasympathetic\
    \ nervous system is referred to as the rest and digest aspects of our nervous\
    \ system, responsible for processes such as sleeping, digesting food, and feeling\

    \ reviewing the Wikipedia page. I always recommend this for any new domain. I\
    \ wanted to check the things I thought I knew and see if I could find connections\
    \ to more established research. As is often the case, there is a lot of shifting\
    \ in the way we think about the autonomic nervous system and the sympathetic-parasympathetic\
    \ divide: who has what role, how we should think about them, and if it really\
    \ is that straightforward. \n\nWhen I talk about this, I aim to appropriately\
    \ mix the information I usually share, which is based on older concepts, with\
    \ what appears to be the new ways of thinking emerging in the field. In general,\

  text: 'On pneumonics for that, my particular mnemonic for the sympathetic and parasympathetic
    nervous systems is that the sympathetic is the fight or flight response, because
    you''re ready to confront a threat. In contrast, the parasympathetic is like eating
    a pear; you''re relaxing and enjoying life. It''s not a perfect mnemonic, but
    it''s the best one I have. I realize that some of you may go off to medical school
    and will need to memorize information, which is something I am personally allowed
    to skim through. That could be a good use of that technology.


    So, we have sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. Sympathetic is associated
    with the fight or flight response. One distinction I came across is that a better
    way to think of it is that the sympathetic nervous system is tuned for high-speed,
    fast-paced, low-latency actions that require arousal and typically activate your
    muscular-skeletal system in order to respond to the environment quickly. In contrast,
    the parasympathetic nervous system manages slower, calmer, and quieter processes
    that unfold over long periods of time, such as digestion and sleep, as opposed
    to getting into a fight.


    Of course, there are many aspects of our behavior that require a combination of
    both systems. For example, consider playing sports, where good performance necessitates
    a blend of fast and precise actions along with a calm state of mind to avoid panicking.
    There are various socio-personal and physiological processes that similarly need
    a complex balance of arousal and relaxation.


    When you look up the autonomic nervous system, you''ll often see diagrams illustrating
    the functions of the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems; the parasympathetic
    system connects to certain parts of your body, while the sympathetic system connects
    to others. In many respects, these descriptions are reasonable, and I also believe
    that the autonomic nervous system, as described in various sources like Wikipedia,
    provides a helpful framework for understanding these concepts.'

  text: 'On this page, we''ll talk about the pictures in a second. There are some
    nice tables and a lot of physiology information, which, in my area of research,
    I tend to avoid learning too much about. However, these letters and numbers refer
    to vertebrae, such as T6, T7, and T8, which correspond to the sixth, seventh,
    and eighth vertebrae of your thoracic region. You have cervical, thoracic, and
    lumbar regions, and so on.


    Now, down here in the function section, there are nice lists that typically describe
    the aspects of your sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, which tend
    to be paired with one another. The parasympathetic connection to your gut stimulates
    digestion and initiates peristalsis and secretion of various substances into different
    areas. In contrast, your sympathetic nervous system tends to shut down these functions.
    The reasoning is that if you''re going to get into a fight, you don''t want to
    waste energy on digestion.


    As you analyze these functions, think of the things necessary for general survival,
    which are activated by the parasympathetic nervous system, versus the optional
    subsystems you would want to deactivate if you were in a fight-or-flight situation,
    activated by the sympathetic nervous system. Essentially, you don''t digest food
    when you''re in a fight; the thought process is that this will be handled later.


    There are some interesting connections that we will revisit if I manage my time
    properly, such as those related to your eyes, your iris, and pupil constriction.
    I discovered an interesting fact: the parasympathetic system affects the lens
    inside your eye. When you look at something and defocus, you are controlling the
    lens, and those muscles interact interestingly with the sympathetic and parasympathetic
    functions.


    Returning to the anatomical aspects of your nervous system, there are specific
    characteristics that are associated with the sympathetic and parasympathetic parts
    of your body.'

    \ I wouldn't go so far as to define them strictly as part of the peripheral system\

    \ So, it becomes difficult to categorize them clearly. The argument continues,\

    \ aspect called the sympathetic trunk. This structure consists of pairs of ganglia\
    \ that run down the edge of your spine on the outside. A ganglion is essentially\
    \ a cluster of neurons. For example, we often discuss retinal ganglion cells that\
    \ pool together different photoreceptors. Many organisms, including insects and\
    \ other creatures lacking a central nervous system, have ganglia. For instance,\
    \ dragonflies possess ganglia and bulbs that manage their visual inputs and motor\

    \ in arousal. In situations that suggest a fight-or-flight response, the sympathetic\
    \ nervous system ramps up general activation in the body. This process is managed\
    \ by the ganglion cells that help regulate this increased level of arousal. I\

  text: Cranial nerve X structure, I don't know one of the cranial nerves. It's one
    of the cranial nerves, so for you future doctor types, you will be forced to look
    at this list of cranial nerves, which will become very familiar to you. The cranial
    nerves include the optic nerve, which is one of them, and the oculomotor nerve,
    which controls eye movements. It's basically just the nerves that control your
    facial expressions, among others. The vagus nerve is one of them; it breaks out
    of your central nervous system in the cranium and then runs down through your
    body, wrapping around. This is all one neuron and it has many parts. With neurons,
    the long parts are called the axons, and then you have dendrites. I'm actually
    not sure if the dendrites are at the beginning or the end, but this is all one
    long neuron that tends to go down and wrap around a lot of the viscera of your
    body, including your respiratory system and down into the gut. When I earlier
    talked about the enteric nervous system, which is the gut-based nervous system,
    this is its main mode of communication. The primary way that your gut communicates
    with the central nervous system is through the vagus nerve. Similarly, I tend
    to associate the sympathetic trunk with that shocking feeling of being surprised.
    You can think about all the different emotions and feelings that relate to sinking
    feelings in your chest or your guts feeling tied up, like that empty feeling in
    the pit of your stomach. I had a similar reaction when I first saw pictures of
    this; I realized that's where all those feelings come from. If I were to point
    to those feelings, it would be these spaghetti-like cacophonies of parts of the
    vagus nerve.

    \ runs down the spine. The parasympathetic system tends to be associated with\

    \ Most of the time, your breathing happens automatically, but you can choose to\

    \ You can hold your breath for a while, though you can't do it until you die\u2014\
    just a quick warning: don\u2019t try to pass out by holding your breath. \n\n\
    On the other hand, heart rate is a bit different; it operates at a deeper layer\
    \ in your nervous system. You cannot control your heart rate in the same way you\
    \ control your breath, and you can't control your breath in the same way you control\

    \ naive, mechanistic thinking about the heart, which I believed for quite some\
    \ time. You would imagine that if you're a doctor assessing the health of someone's\
    \ nervous system, you would look at their heart rate and you would look for heart\
    \ rate variability. You would say heart rate variability is good; when it's low,\
    \ we prefer our heart beats to be very regular, like a metronome, and when the\
    \ variability in timing between beats is low, that's when your heart is doing\
    \ its job very well. However, it turns out that, although this is the case, there\
    \ is a caveat around this. When we think about things like heart rate variability,\
    \ one of the things we look for, as if I were a medical doctor, is there's a healthy\
    \ range of variability that, if you are not showing, that's a sign that something\
    \ is going awry under the hood.\n\nBriefly, if you think about heart rate variability,\
    \ it's literally just measuring the heart rate and then doing statistics on the\
    \ time between beats. This is not just heart rate variability. If anyone has ever\
    \ seen an EKG, which stands for electrocardiogram\u2014don't ask me why it starts\
    \ with a C\u2014it's the timing between these beats that we're thinking of as\
    \ the heartbeat. There are a lot of other things you can say about the other types\
    \ of shapes that are going on here, which is literally below my level of analysis,\
    \ but it's the variability between the actual beats of your heart that we associate\
    \ with heart rate variability.\n\nSo, when we look at those numbers, there is\
    \ an inherent time scale involved because we're talking about the statistics of\
    \ a timed thing. You can imagine that at some point in all of our lives, we will\
    \ be asked by our doctors to wear a heart rate monitor for 48 hours straight.\
    \ They will measure our heartbeat and analyze various aspects of our nervous system\
    \ through the statistics of those heart rates. You can imagine that at the 24-hour\

    \ night versus walk around during the day, leading to variability on that 24-hour\

  text: Faster for part of the day and then slower for another part of the day. But
    that's not the time, and that's an interesting time scale, but that's not the
    time scale that we're thinking about here. The time scale that we tend to associate
    with this conversation around the autonomic nervous system and these trade-offs
    between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems happens on the scale
    of breaths. One of the subtle aspects of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous
    systems is that in a healthy, happy, cheerfully functioning nervous system, the
    trade-off between the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems occurs every time
    you take a breath. Specifically, when you inhale, your sympathetic system starts
    to wake up, and your heart rate increases during the inhalation. Then, when you
    exhale, your parasympathetic system takes over, and your heart rate slows down
    during that part of your breath. It's very hard to feel that. At that layer, when
    I try to cue into my heart rate and determine if it's speeding up when I'm inhaling
    and slowing down when I'm exhaling, it's challenging because my ability to be
    aware of it is about the same as my ability to lie to myself about my sensations.
    So, I really have no idea if I'm actually feeling that or if I'm just expecting
    it. However, I think that whatever that personal somatic journey might be, it's
    easier to do when my heart rate is elevated. When I'm exercising and my heart
    rate is beating fast in general, I can often feel that when I inhale, especially
    if I hold my breath; you can feel your heart rate speeding up, and when you exhale,
    you can feel it slowing down. This conversation about heart rate variability ideally
    happens at the scale of your breath. Typically, when you hear people talk about
    heart rate variability, they tend to discuss it on that time scale, not on things
    like the 24-hour time scale or even the multi-hour time scale. Although, if you
    dig into this a little bit, there's plenty for people to say about heart rate
    variability at those kinds of time scales. This is where we get to a bit of jargon.

    \ the different parts of the vagus nerve handling different aspects of your regulatory\

    \ what we might consider a healthy, happy, and well-functioning relationship between\
    \ a given mammalian nervous system and the world at large can be measured and\
    \ understood as the ability of your nervous system to maintain a healthy and comfortable\
    \ trade-off between different aspects of your autonomic nervous system in a smooth\
    \ and orderly manner. The ability of your body to transition from that arousal\
    \ state associated with sympathetic activation and fight-or-flight response into\
    \ the rest and digest state is key. The ability to make those transitions smoothly\
    \ from one to the other is what we tend to refer to as neurovisceral theory. \n\
    \nAt a broader level, this concept involves the idea that your neurons\u2014your\
    \ nervous system, including your central nervous system and brain\u2014are connected\
    \ to your viscera, which includes the lesser organs, specifically your heart rate,\
    \ gut, and lungs. If you doubt this connection, just think about something scary\

    \ most abstract aspects of your cognitive neural system and the lower-level functions\
    \ necessary for pumping blood and maintaining life. Thus, those parts are connected.\

    \ the goop again; it's thought to be associated with the dopaminergic system.\
    \ If I am pretty sure that if I do this with my body, I'll get the outcome that\
    \ I want, and then I achieve that outcome, there's a dopaminergic release. Your\
    \ literal dopaminergic response is the generation of dopamine, so it releases\
    \ these chemicals into your nervous system that effectively reinforce whatever\
    \ just happened because it was good. We want to reinforce that those neurons should\
    \ be connected in that way because it leads to results that I like in my life.\
    \ \n\nThis introduces the concept of valence. Valence is essentially a root of\
    \ value; it's like a thumbs up or a thumbs down. Good valence things are generally\
    \ good, while bad valence things are generally bad. For example, if I reach out\
    \ to touch something and it has razor blades in it and I get cut, I don\u2019\
    t like that\u2014that's bad. Similarly, if I fire 15 milliseconds too late and\
    \ I miss the target and drop it, that\u2019s a negative valence. \n\nIt\u2019\
    s useful to think about this concept because I am not discussing scale. A valence\
    \ of -0.1 is negative in the same way that -150,000 is negative, and -0.1 is positive;\
    \ -1000 is negative. The valence there is not a measure of the scale. \n\nThere\u2019\
    s a relationship between making a prediction about the world and whether that\
    \ prediction works out in the way we wanted, which defines whether our nervous\
    \ system thinks, \"That was great, let's do more of that,\" or, \"That was bad,\
    \ I didn't like that outcome.\" When we make bad predictions, it means we made\
    \ mistakes; errors occurred in the calculation, and we need to correct for those\
    \ things at some level. \n\nSo, there\u2019s a central concept of prediction,\
    \ and then this other concept of the outcome of those predictions, which determines\
    \ how the nervous system will organize itself. \n\nI realize I may have put that\
    \ out of order, but let\u2019s proceed. How are we doing on time? I think I forgot\

    \ we encounter traumatic events\u2014places where things happen that you did not\
    \ like. Such events can lead to asynchronies between your autonomic nervous system\
    \ and breakdowns of what we call the neurovisual integration theory, which posits\

    \ by empirical research, and also hear a lot in casual environments. Sometimes,\
    \ you might hear people try to distinguish between 'capital T trauma' and 'lowercase\
    \ T trauma,' where lowercase T trauma might refer to a minor inconvenience, like\
    \ burning your lip on a hot cup of coffee, while capital T trauma involves serious\
    \ events, such as being in a car accident that instills a fear of cars. I understand\
    \ why some people feel upset when others might seem to be watering down these\

    \ issues like PTSD, which can be very debilitating for people's lives. I think\

    \ acute PTSD. Van der Kolk was one of the authors who helped define PTSD in the\

    \ way. It discusses traumatic experiences in a graphic manner, making it hard\
    \ to recommend to those who have experienced significant trauma. While it is not\

    \ body to transition appropriately between the fight or flight state, governed\

    \ might associate being in a state of calm and relaxed, especially if you're around\
    \ other people, especially in an environment that, I don't know, is available\
    \ for danger.\n\nThe sympathetic nervous system might be unwilling to give up\
    \ that reactivity at times when it needs to, and it's thought that you could sort\
    \ of measure that in terms of heart rate variability. If you measure someone's\
    \ heart rate and look for those transitions of high speed versus low speed heart\

    \ be achieved if we have three consecutive generations where every child gets\
    \ to experience stability, comfort, and care for the first 18 years of their life.\
