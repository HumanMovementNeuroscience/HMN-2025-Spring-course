full_transcript: "Okay, hello everybody. Today we're going to talk about actual proper\
  \ neuroscience, arguably for the first time, which is always an exciting point,\
  \ especially halfway through the semester. Also, in line with tradition, I realized\
  \ when I got here that I had taken a bunch of notes and written a lot of stuff up,\
  \ but then forgot to push it up, so we don't have the most up-to-date material here,\
  \ but that's fine. Basically, this is the point of the semester where the divergence\
  \ from the plan becomes more noticeable. We are here roughly, and we did some of\
  \ the material but not all of it. We haven't talked about eyeballs yet, but we will\
  \ start discussing vision and related topics probably next time. The evolution material\
  \ I'll probably combine together, and we'll get to it. The soft goal is, at some\
  \ point before the end of the semester, to reach a point where I'm talking about\
  \ my actual proper human science research, which has a lot of different background\
  \ aspects because it's about visual control of locomotion over rough terrain. So,\
  \ all of these things kind of come together. We should also have enough time to\
  \ cover some additional topics toward the end, and I think we'll get there. Now,\
  \ catching up with where we currently are, we've done some material. While I'm talking,\
  \ in the server at the top under the resources channel, in the same place we discussed\
  \ last time, there is a thread called 'server scrape checkpoints.' Click into that.\
  \ I figured out what was wrong with the last one; it was a simple Windows issue.\
  \ At some point in its history, Windows decided that 280 characters is as long as\
  \ a file path ever needs to be or should be, so it throws an error if your path\
  \ lengths get too long. You can change that setting, but this ZIP file had a long\
  \ file name, which caused the error. This new 7z is a different form of ZIP that\
  \ doesn't have that issue. If you want to see where things were last week, this\
  \ one is the one that's up-to-date up to then. The one from this morning, if you\
  \ download it and unzip it, will still throw two errors saying the pkl and JSON\
  \ files are unhappy, but just... Skip those and unpack the rest of it. Try to open\
  \ it up in Obsidian, and hopefully by the time you get to that point, I will have\
  \ reached that same point in my conversation. So give that a shot and see how far\
  \ you get.\n\nA lot of the work we've been doing until now has been on the data\
  \ and computational side of things. The topic of the course is the neural control\
  \ of real-world human movement. We've been focusing more up to this point on basic\
  \ methods, the types of data that can be collected, and the measurements that can\
  \ be taken, as well as a little bit into the more theoretical aspects.\n\nAll the\
  \ discussion about full-body center of mass and those simplified models of the body,\
  \ how it moves around the world, pertains to the study of the neural control of\
  \ real-world human movement. This essentially emphasizes the kinds of measurements\
  \ you can take and the empirical investigation involved. We're going to revisit\
  \ the methods side of things when we talk about vision and bring out the eye tracker\
  \ for more data analysis.\n\nToday, I want to focus more on the landscape of neural\
  \ control and motor control. This is a topic I've often found myself referring back\
  \ to in conversations towards the end of the last parts of previous classes. While\
  \ it's not directly in the syllabus, I want to discuss the concept of the motor\
  \ hierarchy as it relates to the neural control of movement. It\u2019s a fundamental\
  \ aspect of our neural motor systems, arranged hierarchically, with the cortex\u2014\
  represented by the lumpy pink mass\u2014at the top. Below that are the various subcortical\
  \ systems, spinal cord, and muscles, with what you might consider the base-level\
  \ physics of the world at the bottom of that hierarchy.\n\nWe will touch on that,\
  \ but we won't delve particularly deep into any specific aspect of it because I\
  \ want to allow enough time for us to split into groups and conduct our own explorations.\
  \ This time, we will be more organized by presumed topic as we break things down.\
  \ The room is divided into different parts of this hierarchy we want to discuss\
  \ today. The idea is to use your collective efforts to flesh out parts of the brief,\
  \ overview, which I will provide shortly. We'll get to that in a moment. This exploration\
  \ involves you all contributing to the landscape we've been discussing. We've been\
  \ playing with it a bit by interacting with the bot and asking it questions about\
  \ your presumed interests. As the semester has progressed, I have made more updates\
  \ to the code I use to scrape those conversations from the server and then compile\
  \ them into a different configuration of AI tools. I am asking a different large\
  \ language model (LLM) configuration to pull out the topics you all have been asking\
  \ about in order to create a landscape of your interests.\n\nTo look at that, I\
  \ assume you have downloaded the zip file and extracted it. If you're on a Mac,\
  \ it may look slightly different, but by now, I trust you know how to unzip files.\
  \ If you don\u2019t, ask a neighbor; if they don\u2019t know, just wait and ask\
  \ me later.\n\nSo, you want to download and extract it into a regular folder anywhere\
  \ on your computer. At some point, you should have downloaded Obsidian MD, which\
  \ is free software. When you have it, download and double-click on it. It may look\
  \ a little different the first time you open it. I can't remember if I've done that\
  \ on this computer already. For me, it's down here, but again, it may look different\
  \ on a Mac. Find something that looks like \"Manage Vaults\" or \"Open Vault.\"\
  \ If you press Control + O, it might give you a screen that looks something like\
  \ this. The option you want is called \"Open Folder as Vault.\" Obsidian just calls\
  \ folders vaults for whatever reason. So, open that and navigate to the folder you\
  \ just extracted. There are a lot of unnecessary subfolders in that zip file, which\
  \ I figured out this morning. It doesn't matter which one you pick, but just to\
  \ make it a little cleaner, I'm going to click through the top level into \"AI Processed.\"\
  \ \n\nThis server scrapes is just the raw data, so it's effectively the markdown\
  \ file that is attached to the top of each chat. This is basically a folder full\
  \ of those things, laid out in a similar structure to the server. I'm just going\
  \ to click through that into \"AI Processed.\" In here, there is a lot of stuff,\
  \ and you will notice that these folder names correspond to the same categories\
  \ we have in the actual server. If you click into that, these will correspond to\
  \ the names of the topics and channels. \n\nI'm getting distracted as I often do.\
  \ In here, I can select this folder and let Obsidian open it up. It's white for\
  \ some reason; I don't know why it decided to be in light mode for me, but that's\
  \ fine enough for now. There is a lot of stuff in here. If you click through this,\
  \ every now and then, in addition to the raw conversation attached to the bottom,\
  \ you have links here. If you click on the link, it will take you to that message\
  \ in the server, probably on the browser version of the server. Up here is an extracted\
  \ summary of the topics covered in this conversation, which was presumably about\
  \ tracking and VR, whoever had that conversation. There is a lot of art to figuring\
  \ out the right way to tell a language model to chew on a big blob of text in order\
  \ to pull out topics, but in this particular case, I was mostly focused on just...\
  \ We're getting raw topics covered. I gave it this structure of pulling out a title,\
  \ an extremely short summary, highlights, a very short summary, a short summary,\
  \ and a detailed summary, sort of like different levels of abstraction. This approach\
  \ is meant to help organize the information effectively. Importantly, I also added\
  \ tags. These tags are in hashtag format, known as Kebab case, which means they\
  \ use lowercase letters and numbers with hyphens between them. The purpose of the\
  \ tags is to enable us to click on this little graph view, which presents a visual\
  \ representation of the data. Each dot corresponds to one of the chats that were\
  \ had. If we go over to filters and turn on the tags, we can see all the tags that\
  \ were covered. There are a couple of things to note here. First of all, this is\
  \ fun; I love this type of thing. There are many options for display. I\u2019m not\
  \ sure why it\u2019s in light mode, but that\u2019s fine. It could be nice to adjust\
  \ the text, let the nodes be a little smaller, and have them be less thick. You\
  \ can navigate around here. The green ones represent the tags, and the black ones\
  \ represent the notes. I don\u2019t want to belabor this particular point or get\
  \ too deep into the technical aspects of how to use this kind of tool. Obsidian\
  \ is nice because there are a lot of tutorials available, so if you're curious about\
  \ taking notes in this manner and want your general notes to have a cohesive internal\
  \ structure, just hop on YouTube and search for Obsidian. You\u2019ll find plenty\
  \ of useful information there. The basic idea is that there are specific tags; for\
  \ example, the biomechanics tag has been present in many of your conversations.\
  \ If I click on that, it will show me all the tags that have been discussed. So,\
  \ you could look up, for instance, the impact of knee injuries on biomechanics.\
  \ If I click on that, it leads to a conversation that one of you had about knee\
  \ injuries. Biomechanics is what was discussed here. You can click on this, and\
  \ it will take you to the server version or the online browser version that has\
  \ to load up. Yes, so this was Grace\u2014if you're in here, where did you go? Wait,\
  \ is that the right one? No, it's a different thing. So, biomechanics is very well\
  \ connected; neuroscience is obviously well connected, and neural control is well\
  \ connected. There are also some orphans out here that are not connected. Mathematical\
  \ ambiguity and interpretations can sometimes be caused by conversations that are\
  \ super short, so there isn't much content there. AI has people-pleaser energy,\
  \ so if you tell it to summarize something that only contains a greeting followed\
  \ by nothing else, it will still try to come up with a full summary, even though\
  \ that's not valid. In this particular case, someone was asking about mathematics\
  \ or operations or something. Oh, actually, remember how I told you that I was not\
  \ going to scrape the playground channel? I lied. It is in here because it's easier\
  \ to not ignore it. Occasionally, some of these conversations are doing their best\
  \ to pull a reasonable summary out of discussions that are intentionally misleading.\
  \ So, I will leave that roughly there. Another thing to mention is that you'll notice\
  \ a lot of these tags are orphan tags; they are only included in one conversation.\
  \ This thing, sods, is something that will probably be connected more once we finish\
  \ talking about eye movements. Some of these, like trust, don't need to be a tag\
  \ in this class. The way I wrote the prompt or didn't do any cleanup afterward allowed\
  \ it to pull in stuff that really shouldn't be there. Brain-computer interfaces\
  \ probably should be in there. \"Seeds in body\"\u2014someone was talking about\
  \ eating plants. I remember that. There are some things here where you can kind\
  \ of tell that the way the information was extracted impacted the results. It actually\
  \ didn't do a terrible job this time, but yes, so consciousness. Variations like\
  \ that should really have the tag \"Consciousness,\" and then anyone else who talked\
  \ about that, which I know there's at least a couple of you, would get matched in\
  \ there. This is the case where the way the bot extracted the tags, if that was\
  \ done more skillfully or carefully, would create a more connected system of topics\
  \ and content. Some of that is about having more conversations to create more connections;\
  \ some of it is about making the prompt a little better. And anytime you're doing\
  \ anything with AI and language generation, there's always a need for a human cleanup\
  \ step. So, I could go through and clean this up or ask you to clean it up, and\
  \ maybe we'll do that. We're going to be using music and money. What are you talking\
  \ about? Yeah, so figuring out how to expand this stuff\u2014y'all can jump in there\
  \ and look at what your classmates have been talking about. We're going to be doing,\
  \ in the latter part of the class, a little bit more toward the direction of you\
  \ all producing more curated blobs of text that are designed to help pull together\
  \ some of these disparate, disconnected things. I will be continuing, over the course\
  \ of the semester, to increase the sophistication of this extraction. The idea is\
  \ to find a way to let all of you have your explorations of this topic cohere into\
  \ a navigable landscape of this comedically vast topic. I told it\u2014I tried to\
  \ get it not to do this. I told it not to use names, but this topic is about Caroline's\
  \ interest in human anatomy and surgery. That should not have been the title; that's\
  \ a bad title. However, it's not Caroline's fault; that's just the way it is. Being\
  \ more careful with the prompting would help avoid situations like that, as would\
  \ keeping the style consistent. Also, just to make it run fast and cheap, this was\
  \ processed by GPT-3.5, which is not as advanced as GPT-4, but it is very fast and\
  \ effectively free at this point. With this setup, we're processing a high volume\
  \ of text, so the cost becomes noticeable if you use the larger models. If you use\
  \ the bigger models, it would take half an hour to an hour or more to process all\
  \ these things, whereas with 3.5, it is effectively free and processes in about\
  \ 30 seconds instead of 30 minutes. Extracting summaries, it's sort of smart enough\
  \ for that. That's what natural language processing has been doing for like 20 years.\
  \ However, you do kind of get some dumb behavior where it's like, that's not even\
  \ the right capitalization. Okay, cool. So, yeah, it makes sense. Great. If it doesn't\
  \ make sense, that's also fine. If you have technical issues getting it running\
  \ and reaching the point where you can look at it, we'll handle that in a little\
  \ bit here. But there's no real obligations for you with this side of the class\
  \ right now. This is more of an update on my homework and where we're at with it\
  \ because real work is typically iterative in nature. Okay, so this is the place\
  \ where, if I had successfully pushed my notes to GitHub, we would be looking at\
  \ them right now. But they weren't particularly extensive anyway. So I'll take this\
  \ as an opportunity to show a little bit about how the bot works. With something\
  \ like the motor hierarchy, which is a well-trodden topic in any class that talks\
  \ about motor neuroscience, if I ask the bot to give me a lecture outline for the\
  \ motor hierarchy, it'll provide something good, especially because it already has\
  \ the syllabus of the class kind of baked into it with that top-level prompt. I\
  \ have this other channel where I use AI for my own purposes, which you can also\
  \ create if you want, but we'll talk about that later, or maybe not. In that server,\
  \ if I wanted to give it a simple preamble, it wouldn't do as effectively as this\
  \ class is prompted. As good of a job as possible, because this one is already in\
  \ the context of having the syllabus of the server for the class baked into itself,\
  \ it does a decent job. Oh, give me the order from highest to lowest, because it\
  \ did that the other way. Great. So, there you go. Now you have everything you need\
  \ to know about the motor hierarchy. Not really. This kind of thing, and give me\
  \ an additional outline about the corticospinal tract. Yeah, that's another area.\
  \ I wonder if it didn't mention that in the original. Yeah, it did mention it briefly,\
  \ but this is another kind of thing.\n\nSo, when you're navigating this kind of\
  \ AI-mediated language space, there's often a balance you want to strike between\
  \ what I think of as top-down versus bottom-up types of investigations. A bottom-up\
  \ approach is kind of like giving it a very loose instruction set and just seeing\
  \ what pops out at you. For example, telling it to tell me about neuroscience will\
  \ give you a broad-scoped thing, versus more of a top-down approach where you, as\
  \ the human, give it more structure and say, \u2018No, give me more specifically\
  \ this type of thing.\u2019 You get different responses that way, and both approaches\
  \ can be quite useful.\n\nThe analogy, and this is a recurring theme when working\
  \ with AI, is that often the strategies that work well with AI are also like Funhouse\
  \ versions of things that generally work when talking to humans, if for no other\
  \ reason than they were trained on human data. For instance, when we started this\
  \ course, I said, \u2018Hey, go have an introductory talk. Ask the bot about whatever\
  \ you want.\u2019 That's a very bottom-up approach. I'm just saying, \u2018Hey,\
  \ room full of people, ask this thing a bunch of questions based on whatever you\
  \ are interested in talking about.\u2019 A lot of the early part of this class sort\
  \ of had that structure. The ones that are kind of driven by lectures are a little\
  \ more structured, but a lot of the conversations so far have been very bottom-up,\
  \ meaning that I am not imposing a structure from the top down. The topics that\
  \ are covered, and that sort of graph that was shown, are a result of that bottom-up\
  \ type of approach. If we think about the kind of conversations that happened in\
  \ this channel, this was the one that occurred after the Center of Mass Basis Support\
  \ lecture last time. I said, \"Hey, now ask the bot questions; have conversations\
  \ about this lecture.\" That's more structured, but it's still fairly open. This\
  \ contrasts with the idea of writing a class or writing a paper about a topic.\n\
  \nWhen you're working with AI and trying to steer it to generate something that\
  \ relates to your internal state, something you want to bring out into the world,\
  \ it's often beneficial to swap back and forth between these two modes of thinking.\
  \ For example, you might say, \"Hey, give me an outline of this topic\" without\
  \ a bunch of structure, and then take the structure it provides, clean it up, alter\
  \ it, edit it, and give it back to the AI. You could then say, \"Give me more information\
  \ about this outline; flesh it out further.\" \n\nOften, it isn't even worth doing\
  \ that first step if you already know what you're interested in. Just ask specific\
  \ questions, and you will get specific answers. There are different modes of using\
  \ this AI, and one thing I\u2019ve mentioned frequently is that one of the best\
  \ things these AIs are good for is helping you flesh out your unknown unknowns.\
  \ You might have an interest in a topic, but you don't know enough to identify the\
  \ parts you have questions about. So, you can ask generally, \"Tell me more about\
  \ this,\" and the AI will provide a bunch of information. You might find words that\
  \ are unfamiliar, prompting you to ask about those specific terms, and you can navigate\
  \ through the topic that way.\n\nHowever, you also want to drive the conversation\
  \ a bit. Anyway, I mostly asked for this just to have a cheat sheet of the actual\
  \ parts I wanted to talk about. I always have to do this right. Okay, can I do it\
  \ like this? I guess I can do that like this. This is the part where I get frustrated\
  \ with Discord for poor use of space. Okay, so the motor hierarchy broadly speaking\
  \ corresponds to the organization of responsibilities within your motor cortex.\
  \ Your motor system, from the high-level abstract thoughts like, \"I'm thirsty,\
  \ I wish I had water,\" or, \"I'm hungry, I want to eat,\" down to the level of,\
  \ \"I am trying to put force into the world so that I can move my body in the direction\
  \ of water or food.\" The way we complete a given task requires a combination of\
  \ these different levels. If you only think about the motor system as something\
  \ that is attached to your muscles, applying forces to pick up objects or push on\
  \ the ground, you will never achieve coordinated behavior as you move towards your\
  \ goals. At the same time, if you only consider the context of high-order volitional\
  \ desires, such as preferring fruit to wheat or feeling thirsty after talking a\
  \ lot, you won't have the goal-driven behaviors necessary for meaningful coordinated\
  \ movement that produces actual results.\n\nSo, I want to... can I zoom in here?\
  \ Yeah, sure! I think I did a picture like this at the beginning, but I will try\
  \ to provide you more of an atlas of these parts and how they connect to each other,\
  \ working together to flesh out the details. Specifically, today I want you to start\
  \ looking up papers on these topics and using the bot to help you engage with the\
  \ deeper content. Shift away from simply asking the raw AI to provide textbook-level\
  \ information, like if Wikipedia could talk, and start using it more as a tool to\
  \ navigate waters that are deeper than you can explore on your own.\n\nSo, let's\
  \ start with the brain. The first thing you should do is draw a brain. Do it roughly\
  \ like this: it's a brain. Specifically, that's a mammalian brain. Brain. This is\
  \ not a brain. Someone asked an AI to draw a brain for them; that's not what a brain\
  \ looks like. This is the inside of a brain. Where are the pictures I'm looking\
  \ for? They are roughly similar, but the main part that I try to draw when doing\
  \ that sketch is this part right here, that lumpy part going down. That's your temporal\
  \ lobe, by your temple. The rest is kind of squiggly. I've mentioned this before,\
  \ but you eventually start to learn that all these little squishes, folds, and stuff\
  \ like that, they all have names and they're not random. You can start to distinguish\
  \ when you see brains in popular media whether they are based on an actual brain\
  \ or if it\u2019s just someone depicting a bunch of squishy red stuff. Oh, this\
  \ is the picture I was looking for. So it's all a little bit different; they are\
  \ all rough and not shaped the same, but they all have this. See? This is not a\
  \ real brain; it's missing some important parts, which is not great for an actual\
  \ brain, but that\u2019s fine. This is an object of pure horror. So, there you go.\
  \ This is your temporal lobe, and this stuff up here is the front. Give yourself\
  \ some eyeballs, and that sort of goes in\u2014that's forward\u2014which is actually\
  \ fine for English speakers. We tend to point things the other way, but that's okay.\
  \ I always, I don\u2019t know; I was raised speaking Arabic, so I learn sometimes\
  \ right to left, which comes more naturally, and I was like, I don\u2019t know if\
  \ that\u2019s actually normal or if that\u2019s just... I don\u2019t know. Who cares?\
  \ So, don\u2019t put that one up. Let's put something like this one. Let\u2019s\
  \ give us a proper actual brain, please. Oh, yeah, there we go. So this frontal\
  \ lobe here\u2014all mammals have it. I don't want to talk about other animals'\
  \ brains here because I don\u2019t know how any of the rest of them work. Birds\
  \ in particular, I\u2019m very curious about. They can be very intelligent with\
  \ very different nervous systems, and I don\u2019t know much about that. But the\
  \ frontal lobe is sort of like the... Traditionally, most human parts of the brain\
  \ are quite different from those of other animals, often just in terms of raw volume.\
  \ When comparing to our simpler mammal friends, like cats and rats, the biggest\
  \ differences tend to be the lack of a very pronounced, bulbous frontal lobe. This\
  \ part here is roughly the top of the motor hierarchy, which is the frontal lobe's\
  \ executive function. It is important to understand that when someone is describing\
  \ the brain, it is always a cartoon version of reality. Reality is often weirder,\
  \ more abstract, and less understood than anything someone could convey while speaking\
  \ in a room.\n\nGenerally, it is thought that volitional control originates in the\
  \ prefrontal cortex. The term volition relates to voluntary action. For instance,\
  \ if I want to pick up this box, that initial desire represents the volitional aspect.\
  \ Cartoon-wise, it is believed that these thoughts originate in the prefrontal cortex.\
  \ This area is where the most abstract form of motor desires begins, relating to\
  \ wishes such as wanting water or food.\n\nAgain, cartoon-wise, this desire can\
  \ be seen as passing back through the frontal and prefrontal areas down to the premotor\
  \ and motor cortex. The part located on either side of your head is what we traditionally\
  \ call the primary motor cortex, and it would look something like\u2026 This is\
  \ the part that tends not to get drawn. There we go, that's what I was here for\
  \ before. Again, cartoon versions of reality are not based on nothing; there's a\
  \ reason why we draw this cartoon and not some other cartoon. Nothing is as clean\
  \ as that. The basic trajectory is that those original highly volitional aspects\
  \ of control get passed through different subregions of the brain. This part is\
  \ roughly your premotor cortex, which starts to get more specific. By the time you\
  \ get to the motor cortex, that's where things are thought to start resembling your\
  \ body. This is, again, another kind of picture that you will see in many textbooks\
  \ about neuroscience; you may have seen it before. It's also the kind of thing that\
  \ you will never see in a talk about the motor cortex. The idea represented in this\
  \ picture is that different parts of your brain handle the movement of different\
  \ parts of your body. You get this overrepresentation of things like your hands,\
  \ which have a lot of motor control associated with them, and much less representation\
  \ of things like your hips and legs, which are more simplified. There\u2019s also\
  \ an overrepresentation of things like the face because we perform actions like\
  \ talking. The cartoon version of the story is that the high-level desires, like\
  \ grabbing a cup of water, get passed down from the high level at the frontal lobes\
  \ to the more specific areas of the motor cortex, translated into a more body-mapped\
  \ description of how to move from one place to another. There is this so-called\
  \ sensory-motor homunculus that sometimes gets drawn to illustrate what you look\
  \ like on the inside, essentially mapping your body in relation to the cortical\
  \ magnification of the different parts of your movement. This is clearly the sensory\
  \ homunculus; if you can't figure out why, that's a lesson for the reader. The idea\
  \ is that if you were to map out your motor functions... Awareness and your sensory\
  \ specificity. This is kind of what you would look like. However, this is also the\
  \ kind of thing that, as I mentioned, there\u2019s the sensory cortex, and the motor\
  \ cortex is sort of very close to the somatosensory cortex, which is the sensory\
  \ aspect of things. In the same way that we would move our elbows, wrists, and hands,\
  \ we also have sensations from those areas, and they are right next to each other.\
  \ But again, I have seen many talks from many people, often on the topic of motor\
  \ control and sensorimotor control. The topic of those talks is typically trying\
  \ to say please stop showing this to students; it is not an accurate representation\
  \ of reality. However, they often follow that by explaining much more complicated\
  \ ideas about how it isn't really how it is, but this is the easiest way to discuss\
  \ things like cortical magnification at the motor and sensory levels. Just understand\
  \ that it is not a nice, clear, clean map. It is not the type of thing where, oh,\
  \ here's where your wrist is, here's where your hand is; it's much more complex,\
  \ much more spread out, and much less organized. However, if you sort of zoom out\
  \ and squint and turn your head, this cartoon version of reality is a good place\
  \ to start. This is also the kind of thing where, if you wanted to look up more\
  \ recent papers about the structure and organization of the motor cortex and sensorimotor\
  \ cortex, you will find a lot of good stuff from people actually doing that work.\
  \ It\u2019s also the kind of thing where, if you ask the bot to tell you about this,\
  \ it will probably give you this basic information, and you might have to push it\
  \ to clarify if that\u2019s really what people think. The bot might struggle to\
  \ provide specificity and up-to-date research as it has consumed every textbook,\
  \ which could make it harder for it to deviate from the cartoonized version of reality\
  \ we've come to expect from textbooks. If you wanted to push the bot until it breaks,\
  \ you might try to find a more recent paper on this topic and identify instances\
  \ where the bot provides information that does not align with current understandings.\
  \ I had a brief moment of thinking about how that relates to Wikipedia, but I think\
  \ Wikipedia is famously fast and tends not to hold on to incorrect information for\
  \ very long. Therefore, Wikipedia would probably offer quicker and more direct summaries\
  \ of modern thinking. But I'm not entirely sure that\u2019s one of those spots.\
  \ So anyway, motor hierarchy: here we are, starting in the frontal cortex and going\
  \ back to the motor cortex. Later, when we talk about... Vision tends to start here\
  \ in the occipital lobe. There is a sense that this part of the brain is for sensory\
  \ information, while another part is for higher-level thoughts, abstraction, and\
  \ motor coordination. Then there's this other part that we don't typically talk\
  \ about; I don't talk about it. It's more about recognizing objects, like identifying\
  \ a cup, which relates to memory and context-related thinking. However, I don't\
  \ know much about that aspect. The motor cortex is located here, and the somatosensory\
  \ cortex is over there. I remember that the somatosensory cortex is closer to the\
  \ visual cortex because it relates to vision. They sort of meet in this area. I'm\
  \ going to continue with this explanation, but just so you know, at this point,\
  \ there is also a pathway that bypasses the route I'm about to describe that things\
  \ tend to follow. So we started out saying, \"hey, I wish I had water,\" which gets\
  \ converted into something like a motor plan in the motor cortex that recognizes,\
  \ \"oh, there's water right there.\" Let's assume I don't care about the fact that\
  \ it's not mine; I could reach out and grab it. This action would require taking\
  \ a couple of steps, moving my arm, and grabbing the object, notwithstanding the\
  \ complexity of the steps involved. That's a whole other discussion. I think this\
  \ is also where a lot of questions in the research currently lie; what happens when\
  \ you have a motor plan that needs to evolve over time? For example, I need to walk\
  \ over there and then perform a specific behavior. I think this is an area of neuroscience\
  \ that we still don't understand well. This course's specific focus on the neural\
  \ control of human movement in the real world touches on aspects of neuroscience\
  \ that we just don't know much about. If you consider the methods involved, the\
  \ vast majority of neuroscience and psychological research is conducted with people\
  \ sitting in chairs, performing tasks on tablets, or doing single joint movements.\
  \ Our ability to measure the neural activity of humans, and animals in general,\
  \ while they move around in a space is very limited. We have started to make progress\
  \ on that over the past decade, but many of the theories we hold are based on research\
  \ that does not involve animals being able to navigate the world and engage in multi-step\
  \ processes. So, if you have questions about how that works, ... works. The answer\
  \ is, we largely don't know. But find some papers, and you might find people who\
  \ are working on those questions. So, all of this is happening in the cortex, right?\
  \ The big, lumpy, pink thing on the top. There are a bunch of other parts of your\
  \ central nervous system that we lump together under the heading of subcortical\
  \ regions. My personal favorite is the cerebellum, which is this sort of lumpy part\
  \ down there. The cerebellum, often referred to as the 'little brain', is great.\
  \ I'm going to talk about that in just a second. But there's another component that\
  \ I want to at least mention: honorable mentions of a particular piece that sort\
  \ of lives in the middle. We're doing a side view; all these parts are duplicated\
  \ on either side. For some reason, the left side of your brain controls the right\
  \ side of your body. Don't ask me why; it's just how we evolved. But there is this\
  \ very important part called the basil ganglia. This is particularly interesting\
  \ for those of you that are interested in things like movement disorders because\
  \ it's a part that can go wrong in various interesting ways. The idea is that when\
  \ you have that high-level thought of, 'I want to be holding this box,' and I'm\
  \ sitting here looking at the box, there are many different ways my body could solve\
  \ that problem. I could grab it with my dominant hand, or I could grab it with my\
  \ non-dominant hand. I could grab it with my dominant hand in a weird way, or I\
  \ could move over here and grab it with my dominant hand. All of these are options\
  \ that would satisfy that highly volitional desire to be holding this box in my\
  \ hand. With any kind of network, we often talk about the brain in a kind of serial\
  \ processing manner, similar to a computer analogy. This aligns with our general\
  \ approach of describing the nervous system in the context of the most advanced\
  \ piece of technology that we have. If you go back through history, we tend to always\
  \ do that. So, anytime you're talking about a network, the thinking is, and again,\
  \ this is deep into the cartoon version of stories, that when I have the desire\
  \ to pick up a certain object or pick up a pen, the motor network components that\
  \ would generate... That action gets activated a little bit, and they get activated\
  \ to the point where they're sort of engaging in a kind of competition with each\
  \ other. Motor plan competition, I think, is a term you could look up for that.\
  \ However, it wouldn't really work if every time I had a thought all the possible\
  \ options to make that thing happen were activated at the same time. That's where\
  \ this little superior colliculus comes into play; its presumed role is to suppress\
  \ your motor commands until they reach a certain threshold of activation. In this\
  \ very abstract sense, the best motor command wins out, and then that one crosses\
  \ the threshold and gets triggered to actually move through. In this case, it's\
  \ closest to my dominant hand. I like using my dominant hand; this is a comfortable\
  \ strategy, whereas this is not a comfortable strategy. So, this motor command wins\
  \ the fight between all the possible ways I could solve that problem, and that's\
  \ the one that occurs. You can talk for days about the details\u2014the substantia\
  \ nigra and blah, blah, blah. However, the point I wanted to emphasize here is that\
  \ there are at least two ways that this process could go wrong. One way is that\
  \ the gating, or suppression, that the superior colliculus does can be too strong,\
  \ to the point where none of those commands actually make it through the gate. I'm\
  \ sitting here wanting to move, but I can't actually initiate the action. This way\
  \ of things going wrong is typically what happens in conditions like Parkinson's\
  \ disease. Parkinson's disease is complicated, but one family of symptoms includes\
  \ things like freezing\u2014freezing in gait, freezing in motor commands. People\
  \ see what they want to do, but they can't initiate the action. This is thought\
  \ to be related to the superior colliculus over-gating the problem, so none of the\
  \ available motor commands are able to trip over the gate and actually allow things\
  \ to initialize. There\u2019s interesting information there. Another way that this\
  \ can go wrong is what I mentioned before: it would be bad if all the motor commands\
  \ happened all at once. That's another issue, specifically in a disease called Huntington's\
  \ disease, which is famously genetically predictable. It's one of those things that\
  \ is very heritable. If you have a 50/50 chance of inheriting Huntington's disease\
  \ from a given parent, and if one of your parents has the disease, you have a 25%\
  \ chance of having it as well. We can analyze your genome to determine whether you\
  \ have it or not. This situation raises ethically challenging questions, such as\
  \ what the implications are of having a child if there\u2019s a 25% chance that\
  \ child will inherit a degenerative disorder. Additionally, what are the ethics\
  \ surrounding testing for this condition? If you undergo testing, doctors may know\
  \ whether or not you will develop a degenerative disorder later in life, which leads\
  \ to difficult conversations. \n\nPeople with Huntington's disease exhibit behaviors\
  \ where they unintentionally initiate movements. For instance, if you hold a cup\
  \ with a handle in front of someone with Huntington's disease, they may find it\
  \ extremely difficult not to reach out and grab it. They perceive the opportunity\
  \ to grab it, yet their ability to suppress that behavior fails. As a result, they\
  \ immediately reach out for items they do not intend to grab. \n\nThere is much\
  \ more to explore regarding this topic, particularly since many of you are interested\
  \ in movement disorders, which are often related to these issues. Once the motor\
  \ command has been selected and activated, there is a cascade of activations that\
  \ occurs from that point. Generally speaking, this activation will move from the\
  \ brain to the cerebellum, then to the brainstem, and finally into the spinal cord.\n\
  \nThe cerebellum is a very complex structure, containing roughly 3.5 times as many\
  \ neurons as the rest of the central nervous system combined. These neurons are\
  \ typically small, including granular cells, but they serve crucial roles in motor\
  \ function and coordination. Large neurons called pyramidal cells. I will look at\
  \ pyramidal cells because they're beautiful. Pyramidal cell neurons are the kind\
  \ of thing you win Nobel Prizes for; pictures like that back in the 1800s. These\
  \ are the type of neurons that you get. This might actually be in your motor cortex,\
  \ but these are highly synaptic\u2014like a massive synaptic forest\u2014where the\
  \ output of the neuron, whether or not it's spiking, is dependent on this massive\
  \ network of connections to other parts of your body or other parts of your nervous\
  \ system.  \nYour cerebellum is thought to be the area that handles motor coordination.\
  \ That coordination happens at different levels. Most of your nervous system has\
  \ an inside-out structure where the inner parts of your cerebellum, like the inner\
  \ parts of your brain, are the most ancient, the oldest part. As you move outward,\
  \ you get newer evolutionary structures until you reach the neocerebellum, which\
  \ is the outer part. This structure looks like a lump but is kind of folded up on\
  \ itself. The neocerebellum is on the outside, and it's thought to be associated\
  \ with things like tool use. For instance, the fact that I can pick up an object\
  \ that is not a part of my body and sort of wave it around\u2014now I have sort\
  \ of internalized some of the physics of this thing. That ability to internalize\
  \ the physics and utilize external objects as if they were part of my body is thought\
  \ to be related to the neocerebellum. There's some interesting studies using fMRI\
  \ where they have people playing with tools, and I always get stuck on these little\
  \ side quests because I just have to tell the story because it's so interesting.\
  \ Not all animals can use tools, obviously, but there's a concept in neuroscience\
  \ called peripersonal space. We tend to chop up the world into spots: out there\
  \ is far away stuff, and in here is like my actual body part. Then there's the peripersonal\
  \ space, which is... Close by are areas that I can reach with my current body. Anything\
  \ that's on this table is considered peripersonal space. If you take a monkey, like\
  \ a macaque monkey, a non-human primate that we study, you can induce certain types\
  \ of brain damage that result in various types of blindness. It's possible to get\
  \ a type of blindness in peripersonal space due to particular damage in a specific\
  \ area. Essentially, there are things within a certain range of you that you can't\
  \ see.\n\nThere's a fascinating study where researchers took a macaque and induced\
  \ a reversible lesion by introducing a chemical in that part of the brain, effectively\
  \ stopping its function temporarily. After a while, it would recover. They trained\
  \ the monkey to use a grabber device to reach out and grab items that were farther\
  \ away than its arm's reach. After the monkey learned to use the grabber arm, when\
  \ they performed the cortical lesion, its peripersonal space extended to include\
  \ the areas it could reach with the grabber.\n\nThis presents strange implications\
  \ regarding how we perceive the world and categorize it into things that are part\
  \ of us, things that are not part of us, and things we can manipulate directly.\
  \ For certain types of mammals, the question of what part of the world is our body\
  \ and what part can we interact with using our body extends to include tools. This\
  \ concept includes items that aren't necessarily part of our raw biology, which\
  \ leads us into philosophical territory, especially when we begin to extend the\
  \ notion of tools from basic items like grabbers and hammers to more complex tools\
  \ such as laptops, the internet, and large language models. We often prioritize\
  \ the physical aspects of our interactions, such as making you take tests on pen\
  \ and paper, even though it might not reflect your true abilities.\n\nThere is a\
  \ whole concept of embodied cognition that attempts to extend this notion, suggesting\
  \ that we are essentially ourselves plus our toolset, plus our community of people\
  \ who can assist us with tasks. This topic can get complicated and philosophical\
  \ quite quickly. The lower parts of the cerebellum, the older parts, handle things\
  \ like motor coordination. For example, if I want to flex my arm, there are specific\
  \ areas involved in that process. You have your extension parts, your muscles. The\
  \ flexion tends to move you towards the fetal position, while extension tends to\
  \ move you opposite of that. In order for a movement to be smooth, the flexor and\
  \ extensor groups have to fire in a very tight temporal loop. If they misfire, you\
  \ get behaviors similar to those seen in movement disorders, which often display\
  \ jerky movements. This can come from various places, but it is often associated\
  \ with misfiring. For example, when I extend my arm, the triceps should engage,\
  \ and the biceps should be relaxed. However, if the biceps keep firing while I'm\
  \ trying to extend my arm, it results in a jerkier movement. This is coupled with\
  \ another type of disorder that can lead to what is colloquially referred to as\
  \ the 'drunkard's wobble.' In this case, the postural control system may be firing,\
  \ but it does so slowly, producing a more soupy type of movement. These are just\
  \ different parts of the cascade of issues that can arise in the motor system. Ataxia\
  \ is one term associated with this. \n\nRegarding the cerebellum, your brainstem\
  \ is located below it. Honestly, the brainstem is a part I know the least about.\
  \ It is associated with sensory integration and is often considered part of a lower-level\
  \ integration system involving flexor and extensor groups, timing, and sensory information\
  \ integration\u2014specifically the forces occurring at your joints rather than\
  \ visual information. If you want to look up how the brain stem interacts with other\
  \ systems, you can certainly do that, but I don't have much information there. A\
  \ part I know more about is the spinal cord, which is generally thought of in common\
  \ terms. Often, when we draw the central nervous system, we illustrate it like this\
  \ and cut off the spinal cord. This is incorrect; your spinal cord is a part of\
  \ your central nervous system, and it plays a crucial role in motor control. The\
  \ spinal cord does not extend all the way down the spinal column, which is the bony\
  \ part. It stops around here, just below the rib cage. Below that are the peripheral\
  \ nerves that go in and out to innervate the muscles.\n\nThe structure flips inside\
  \ out: your cortex has gray matter, which consists of the cell bodies of neurons\
  \ on the outside, and white matter, which is composed of the axons and glial cells\
  \ wrapped together on the inside. The spinal cord reverses this arrangement, so\
  \ the cellular connections are on the outside. The blue area shown here is the same\
  \ gray matter that is present on the outside of your cortex.\n\nWe are getting down\
  \ to the very bottom of the motor hierarchy when we talk about the spinal cord.\
  \ The types of controls at the spinal level are definitely a form of processing,\
  \ but there is very little abstraction at this level, if any. This is where your\
  \ spinal cord manages reflexes. For instance, if you ever go to the doctor and they\
  \ hit your knee, causing it to kick out, they are testing your spinal reflexes.\
  \ One of the most basic examples is the monosynaptic stretch reflex. When a muscle\
  \ is stretched, a reflex response makes it contract, which serves as a protective\
  \ mechanism. When the doctor taps the tendon, it stretches the muscle, sending a\
  \ signal to the spine prompting the muscle to contract, resulting in the knee-jerk\
  \ reaction.\n\nHowever, it's not as simple as something that is always active because\
  \ if that reflex were constantly active, you wouldn't be able to move your leg properly.\
  \ The reflex needs to be modulated for coordinated movement. When you move, it stretches\
  \ and then contracts. Your spine handles what's called reflex gating. In order to\
  \ engage a given motor plan, the reflexes have to be configured in a certain way.\
  \ The most famous, and my personal favorite, example of this is in the context of\
  \ the locomotor gait cycle. When you're walking, you're going back and forth between\
  \ each leg: each leg alternates between stance phase and swing phase. In the stance\
  \ phase, you're holding the entire weight of your body on a very stiff leg. If you're\
  \ running, for example, when you impact the ground, you're hitting it with 1.4 times\
  \ your body weight or more. So, your leg has to be very stiff at that moment when\
  \ it hits the ground. Someone once asked about the feeling you get when you step\
  \ off a stair, expecting another stair to be there, but there is one fewer than\
  \ you expect. You have that unpleasant moment where your limb is prepared for ground\
  \ contact that is not at the right level.\n\nWhen you're moving back and forth,\
  \ your legs are transitioning between stance phase and swing phase. In stance phase,\
  \ your reflexes are adjusted to allow your leg to be very stiff and support the\
  \ weight of your body. In swing phase, the reflexes are essentially turned off to\
  \ allow your leg to be more floppy and loose, which lets it swing through and utilize\
  \ its own momentum to move forward efficiently, without burning excess energy.\n\
  \nThis transition from stance to swing phase happens roughly every 450 milliseconds,\
  \ approximately a million times per year for a healthy undergraduate human. This\
  \ transition occurs at the level of the spine, specifically managed by structures\
  \ called central pattern generators. These are responsible for the basic rhythmicity\
  \ of motor control. Most of your motor system is rhythmic in nature, whether you're\
  \ walking, chewing, or scratching\u2014these actions have a rhythmic aspect.\n\n\
  The motor hierarchy comes into play to ensure that movements are graceful, coordinated,\
  \ and smooth, and that they are appropriate for the environment. For instance, when\
  \ stepping onto a step or stepping down, there is a supervenience that occurs as\
  \ you interact with the world. Those high-level volitions, those high-level desires,\
  \ coupled with visual information and sensory information from the world, get translated\
  \ into a set of instructions for how we should lay out the reflexes. This includes\
  \ considerations of timing, strength, and the gains of all these reflexes in order\
  \ to generate movements that are appropriate for the world around us. The idea is\
  \ that, at the lowest level of the nervous system, these very low-level functions\
  \ are executed based on instruction sets that come from the top down. However, the\
  \ signals from the world also go in the other direction, creating a two-way communication\
  \ that is not symmetric. This is where the concept of hierarchy comes into play.\
  \ The high-level directives tend to instruct the low-level functions on what to\
  \ do, but if the low-level functions detect that something has occurred, for instance,\
  \ if you hit something, the higher-level processes will take that into account and\
  \ respond appropriately. \n\nI never have enough time to discuss everything, but\
  \ I will briefly mention that the narrative we've been describing about hierarchy\
  \ is a general, cartoonized version of the motor hierarchy. This tends to reflect\
  \ how mammalian nervous systems are organized. I overlooked an aspect concerning\
  \ muscle synergies; for example, the muscles in my arm work in conjunction rather\
  \ than being controlled separately. Instead of handling each muscle or degree of\
  \ freedom individually, they operate at what is called a synergistic level. For\
  \ most mammals, this is how it works: the high-level functions activate motor plans,\
  \ which lead to motor hierarchies, and that's generally where this process concludes.\n\
  \nHowever, for a small subset of animals, specifically tool-using mammals, there\
  \ is an additional tract known as the corticospinal tract. This tract allows certain\
  \ parts of the nervous system to bypass the rest and directly innervate the spine.\
  \ 'Corticospinal' refers to the pathway from the cortex to the spine. I believe\
  \ this is an area that merits further discussion. What I just said is that I'm roughly\
  \ exhausting my knowledge on the topic. I think it's an area of very active research\
  \ in terms of which animals have a corticospinal tract and which ones do not. With\
  \ biology, it's never a case of a simple yes or no; it's always a matter of degree.\
  \ It is one of those places that is thought to be related to our ability to be magnificent\
  \ adaptation engines, where we can control our bodies in essentially arbitrary ways\
  \ and with a very high level of precision. Fine control is thought to be related,\
  \ in addition to things like the neocortex, which handles tool-using, also to the\
  \ corticospinal tract. Think about learning activities like gymnastics, where you're\
  \ doing something and someone says, \"Oh no, no, not like that; like this.\" Your\
  \ heel is off by an inch and a half in a certain direction; you change the motor\
  \ plan based on the words I'm saying to you. I think, when I philosophically and\
  \ poetically contemplate the nervous system, that it's this type of control that\
  \ is implicated by things like the corticospinal tract.\n\nI just think that comparing\
  \ human movement to other types of animal movement, one of the main questions of\
  \ what makes us different relates to our infinite adaptability relative to most\
  \ other animals. We'll talk a bit about that in the evolution phase of life. This\
  \ adaptability extends to your limbs and muscular functions. \n\nOkay, that's about\
  \ as quick as I can make it. So, anyways, that's roughly speaking about your nervous\
  \ system, at least the motor control parts of it. I've obviously covered a lot of\
  \ ground and said a lot of things. For the rest of the class, I guess I'll just\
  \ let you all be grouped together at this point. I might just have to have a whole\
  \ classroom discussion. There's so much I want to say to you, but I also want to\
  \ give you time to explore on your own. We'll figure that out. There's probably\
  \ not time for coding stuff this time around. I will say let's do roughly what we\
  \ did last time, where we pop into a channel in the lectures area called 2024 10.\
  \ Motor hierarchy. I don't know if I spelled \"hierarchy\" correctly, but there\
  \ you go. Perfect. No questions? Yeah. Just kind of do what we did last time. So,\
  \ pop open some chats and ask it some questions. What I'll specifically ask you\
  \ to do this time, which I haven't done in the past, is to follow your heart. If\
  \ you want to ask more of a high-level question, like, \"Give me the textbook version\
  \ of the story,\" go ahead and do that. If you want to dive deeper into the nitty-gritty\
  \ side of things, where the cartoons break down, ask the bot for keywords that you\
  \ can use in searches like PubMed or Google Scholar to look for papers on the topics\
  \ it's questioned. Don't ask it for specific papers; it will either give you papers\
  \ that are old or it will give you papers that don't exist. So, ask it for keywords,\
  \ and then go search for those papers. You can ask for things like review articles,\
  \ but just ask it for keywords that you can search for. Then, when you find a paper,\
  \ copy the entire abstract, paste it into the chat, and ask it to explain that to\
  \ you. You could read the abstract and figure it out for yourself, but abstracts\
  \ are necessarily and intentionally extremely dense linguistic blobs. There\u2019\
  s pretty much no abstract on the planet that you couldn't spend several lifetimes\
  \ trying to parse out all of the details, all the words, and all the unfamiliar\
  \ phrases. Let's do that for about 13 minutes. It's not much to get into, so I'm\
  \ not going to make it an official assignment, but continue this conversation with\
  \ the bot throughout the day and the week. Just every so often, pop into the chat\
  \ and ask it a question. I'm not going to necessarily make that an assignment. I'll\
  \ make assignments later, but anytime you have a thought, pull it out and ask it\
  \ the question. I will be doing the scrape and pull stuff throughout the week, and\
  \ I'll do it again before next week. So, if you want to steer what that content\
  \ is, ask it questions about the things that you care about."

  text: Okay, hello everybody. Today we're going to talk about actual proper neuroscience,
    arguably for the first time, which is always an exciting point, especially halfway
    through the semester. Also, in line with tradition, I realized when I got here
    that I had taken a bunch of notes and written a lot of stuff up, but then forgot
    to push it up, so we don't have the most up-to-date material here, but that's
    fine. Basically, this is the point of the semester where the divergence from the
    plan becomes more noticeable. We are here roughly, and we did some of the material
    but not all of it. We haven't talked about eyeballs yet, but we will start discussing
    vision and related topics probably next time. The evolution material I'll probably
    combine together, and we'll get to it. The soft goal is, at some point before
    the end of the semester, to reach a point where I'm talking about my actual proper
    human science research, which has a lot of different background aspects because
    it's about visual control of locomotion over rough terrain. So, all of these things
    kind of come together. We should also have enough time to cover some additional
    topics toward the end, and I think we'll get there. Now, catching up with where
    we currently are, we've done some material. While I'm talking, in the server at
    the top under the resources channel, in the same place we discussed last time,
    there is a thread called 'server scrape checkpoints.' Click into that. I figured
    out what was wrong with the last one; it was a simple Windows issue. At some point
    in its history, Windows decided that 280 characters is as long as a file path
    ever needs to be or should be, so it throws an error if your path lengths get
    too long. You can change that setting, but this ZIP file had a long file name,
    which caused the error. This new 7z is a different form of ZIP that doesn't have
    that issue. If you want to see where things were last week, this one is the one
    that's up-to-date up to then. The one from this morning, if you download it and
    unzip it, will still throw two errors saying the pkl and JSON files are unhappy,
    but just...

  text: "Skip those and unpack the rest of it. Try to open it up in Obsidian, and\
    \ hopefully by the time you get to that point, I will have reached that same point\
    \ in my conversation. So give that a shot and see how far you get.\n\nA lot of\
    \ the work we've been doing until now has been on the data and computational side\
    \ of things. The topic of the course is the neural control of real-world human\
    \ movement. We've been focusing more up to this point on basic methods, the types\
    \ of data that can be collected, and the measurements that can be taken, as well\
    \ as a little bit into the more theoretical aspects.\n\nAll the discussion about\
    \ full-body center of mass and those simplified models of the body, how it moves\
    \ around the world, pertains to the study of the neural control of real-world\
    \ human movement. This essentially emphasizes the kinds of measurements you can\
    \ take and the empirical investigation involved. We're going to revisit the methods\
    \ side of things when we talk about vision and bring out the eye tracker for more\
    \ data analysis.\n\nToday, I want to focus more on the landscape of neural control\
    \ and motor control. This is a topic I've often found myself referring back to\
    \ in conversations towards the end of the last parts of previous classes. While\
    \ it's not directly in the syllabus, I want to discuss the concept of the motor\
    \ hierarchy as it relates to the neural control of movement. It\u2019s a fundamental\
    \ aspect of our neural motor systems, arranged hierarchically, with the cortex\u2014\
    represented by the lumpy pink mass\u2014at the top. Below that are the various\
    \ subcortical systems, spinal cord, and muscles, with what you might consider\
    \ the base-level physics of the world at the bottom of that hierarchy.\n\nWe will\
    \ touch on that, but we won't delve particularly deep into any specific aspect\
    \ of it because I want to allow enough time for us to split into groups and conduct\

    \ This exploration involves you all contributing to the landscape we've been discussing.\
    \ We've been playing with it a bit by interacting with the bot and asking it questions\
    \ about your presumed interests. As the semester has progressed, I have made more\
    \ updates to the code I use to scrape those conversations from the server and\
    \ then compile them into a different configuration of AI tools. I am asking a\
    \ different large language model (LLM) configuration to pull out the topics you\
    \ all have been asking about in order to create a landscape of your interests.\n\
    \nTo look at that, I assume you have downloaded the zip file and extracted it.\
    \ If you're on a Mac, it may look slightly different, but by now, I trust you\
    \ know how to unzip files. If you don\u2019t, ask a neighbor; if they don\u2019\
    t know, just wait and ask me later.\n\nSo, you want to download and extract it\
    \ into a regular folder anywhere on your computer. At some point, you should have\
    \ downloaded Obsidian MD, which is free software. When you have it, download and\
    \ double-click on it. It may look a little different the first time you open it.\

    \ This approach is meant to help organize the information effectively. Importantly,\

    \ the chats that were had. If we go over to filters and turn on the tags, we can\
    \ see all the tags that were covered. There are a couple of things to note here.\
    \ First of all, this is fun; I love this type of thing. There are many options\

    \ this kind of tool. Obsidian is nice because there are a lot of tutorials available,\
    \ so if you're curious about taking notes in this manner and want your general\
    \ notes to have a cohesive internal structure, just hop on YouTube and search\
    \ for Obsidian. You\u2019ll find plenty of useful information there. The basic\
    \ idea is that there are specific tags; for example, the biomechanics tag has\
    \ been present in many of your conversations. If I click on that, it will show\
    \ me all the tags that have been discussed. So, you could look up, for instance,\

    Okay, cool. So, yeah, it makes sense. Great. If it doesn't make sense, that's

    my notes to GitHub, we would be looking at them right now. But they weren't particularly
    extensive anyway. So I'll take this as an opportunity to show a little bit about
    how the bot works. With something like the motor hierarchy, which is a well-trodden
    topic in any class that talks about motor neuroscience, if I ask the bot to give
    me a lecture outline for the motor hierarchy, it'll provide something good, especially
    because it already has the syllabus of the class kind of baked into it with that
    top-level prompt. I have this other channel where I use AI for my own purposes,
    which you can also create if you want, but we'll talk about that later, or maybe

    \ by lectures are a little more structured, but a lot of the conversations so\
    \ far have been very bottom-up, meaning that I am not imposing a structure from\

    of responsibilities within your motor cortex. Your motor system, from the high-level
    abstract thoughts like, "I''m thirsty, I wish I had water," or, "I''m hungry,
    I want to eat," down to the level of, "I am trying to put force into the world
    so that I can move my body in the direction of water or food." The way we complete
    a given task requires a combination of these different levels. If you only think
    about the motor system as something that is attached to your muscles, applying
    forces to pick up objects or push on the ground, you will never achieve coordinated
    behavior as you move towards your goals. At the same time, if you only consider
    the context of high-order volitional desires, such as preferring fruit to wheat
    or feeling thirsty after talking a lot, you won''t have the goal-driven behaviors
    necessary for meaningful coordinated movement that produces actual results.

  text: Vision tends to start here in the occipital lobe. There is a sense that this
    part of the brain is for sensory information, while another part is for higher-level
    thoughts, abstraction, and motor coordination. Then there's this other part that
    we don't typically talk about; I don't talk about it. It's more about recognizing
    objects, like identifying a cup, which relates to memory and context-related thinking.
    However, I don't know much about that aspect. The motor cortex is located here,
    and the somatosensory cortex is over there. I remember that the somatosensory
    cortex is closer to the visual cortex because it relates to vision. They sort
    of meet in this area. I'm going to continue with this explanation, but just so
    you know, at this point, there is also a pathway that bypasses the route I'm about
    to describe that things tend to follow. So we started out saying, "hey, I wish
    I had water," which gets converted into something like a motor plan in the motor
    cortex that recognizes, "oh, there's water right there." Let's assume I don't
    care about the fact that it's not mine; I could reach out and grab it. This action
    would require taking a couple of steps, moving my arm, and grabbing the object,
    notwithstanding the complexity of the steps involved. That's a whole other discussion.
    I think this is also where a lot of questions in the research currently lie; what
    happens when you have a motor plan that needs to evolve over time? For example,
    I need to walk over there and then perform a specific behavior. I think this is
    an area of neuroscience that we still don't understand well. This course's specific
    focus on the neural control of human movement in the real world touches on aspects
    of neuroscience that we just don't know much about. If you consider the methods
    involved, the vast majority of neuroscience and psychological research is conducted
    with people sitting in chairs, performing tasks on tablets, or doing single joint
    movements. Our ability to measure the neural activity of humans, and animals in
    general, while they move around in a space is very limited. We have started to
    make progress on that over the past decade, but many of the theories we hold are
    based on research that does not involve animals being able to navigate the world
    and engage in multi-step processes. So, if you have questions about how that works,

    of other parts of your central nervous system that we lump together under the
    heading of subcortical regions. My personal favorite is the cerebellum, which
    is this sort of lumpy part down there. The cerebellum, often referred to as the
    ''little brain'', is great. I''m going to talk about that in just a second. But
    there''s another component that I want to at least mention: honorable mentions

    all these parts are duplicated on either side. For some reason, the left side
    of your brain controls the right side of your body. Don''t ask me why; it''s just
    how we evolved. But there is this very important part called the basil ganglia.
    This is particularly interesting for those of you that are interested in things
    like movement disorders because it''s a part that can go wrong in various interesting
    ways. The idea is that when you have that high-level thought of, ''I want to be
    holding this box,'' and I''m sitting here looking at the box, there are many different
    ways my body could solve that problem. I could grab it with my dominant hand,
    or I could grab it with my non-dominant hand. I could grab it with my dominant
    hand in a weird way, or I could move over here and grab it with my dominant hand.
    All of these are options that would satisfy that highly volitional desire to be
    holding this box in my hand. With any kind of network, we often talk about the
    brain in a kind of serial processing manner, similar to a computer analogy. This
    aligns with our general approach of describing the nervous system in the context
    of the most advanced piece of technology that we have. If you go back through
    history, we tend to always do that. So, anytime you''re talking about a network,
    the thinking is, and again, this is deep into the cartoon version of stories,

    damage that result in various types of blindness. It''s possible to get a type
    of blindness in peripersonal space due to particular damage in a specific area.
    Essentially, there are things within a certain range of you that you can''t see.


    There''s a fascinating study where researchers took a macaque and induced a reversible
    lesion by introducing a chemical in that part of the brain, effectively stopping
    its function temporarily. After a while, it would recover. They trained the monkey
    to use a grabber device to reach out and grab items that were farther away than
    its arm''s reach. After the monkey learned to use the grabber arm, when they performed
    the cortical lesion, its peripersonal space extended to include the areas it could
    reach with the grabber.


    This presents strange implications regarding how we perceive the world and categorize
    it into things that are part of us, things that are not part of us, and things
    we can manipulate directly. For certain types of mammals, the question of what
    part of the world is our body and what part can we interact with using our body
    extends to include tools. This concept includes items that aren''t necessarily
    part of our raw biology, which leads us into philosophical territory, especially
    when we begin to extend the notion of tools from basic items like grabbers and
    hammers to more complex tools such as laptops, the internet, and large language
    models. We often prioritize the physical aspects of our interactions, such as
    making you take tests on pen and paper, even though it might not reflect your
    true abilities.


    There is a whole concept of embodied cognition that attempts to extend this notion,
    suggesting that we are essentially ourselves plus our toolset, plus our community
    of people who can assist us with tasks. This topic can get complicated and philosophical
    quite quickly. The lower parts of the cerebellum, the older parts, handle things

    and cut off the spinal cord. This is incorrect; your spinal cord is a part of
    your central nervous system, and it plays a crucial role in motor control. The
    spinal cord does not extend all the way down the spinal column, which is the bony
    part. It stops around here, just below the rib cage. Below that are the peripheral
    nerves that go in and out to innervate the muscles.


    The structure flips inside out: your cortex has gray matter, which consists of
    the cell bodies of neurons on the outside, and white matter, which is composed
    of the axons and glial cells wrapped together on the inside. The spinal cord reverses
    this arrangement, so the cellular connections are on the outside. The blue area
    shown here is the same gray matter that is present on the outside of your cortex.


    We are getting down to the very bottom of the motor hierarchy when we talk about
    the spinal cord. The types of controls at the spinal level are definitely a form
    of processing, but there is very little abstraction at this level, if any. This
    is where your spinal cord manages reflexes. For instance, if you ever go to the
    doctor and they hit your knee, causing it to kick out, they are testing your spinal
    reflexes. One of the most basic examples is the monosynaptic stretch reflex. When
    a muscle is stretched, a reflex response makes it contract, which serves as a
    protective mechanism. When the doctor taps the tendon, it stretches the muscle,
    sending a signal to the spine prompting the muscle to contract, resulting in the
    knee-jerk reaction.


    However, it''s not as simple as something that is always active because if that
    reflex were constantly active, you wouldn''t be able to move your leg properly.
    The reflex needs to be modulated for coordinated movement.'

    \ to be configured in a certain way. The most famous, and my personal favorite,\
    \ example of this is in the context of the locomotor gait cycle. When you're walking,\
    \ you're going back and forth between each leg: each leg alternates between stance\
    \ phase and swing phase. In the stance phase, you're holding the entire weight\
    \ of your body on a very stiff leg. If you're running, for example, when you impact\
    \ the ground, you're hitting it with 1.4 times your body weight or more. So, your\
    \ leg has to be very stiff at that moment when it hits the ground. Someone once\
    \ asked about the feeling you get when you step off a stair, expecting another\
    \ stair to be there, but there is one fewer than you expect. You have that unpleasant\
    \ moment where your limb is prepared for ground contact that is not at the right\
    \ level.\n\nWhen you're moving back and forth, your legs are transitioning between\
    \ stance phase and swing phase. In stance phase, your reflexes are adjusted to\
    \ allow your leg to be very stiff and support the weight of your body. In swing\
    \ phase, the reflexes are essentially turned off to allow your leg to be more\
    \ floppy and loose, which lets it swing through and utilize its own momentum to\
    \ move forward efficiently, without burning excess energy.\n\nThis transition\
    \ from stance to swing phase happens roughly every 450 milliseconds, approximately\
    \ a million times per year for a healthy undergraduate human. This transition\
    \ occurs at the level of the spine, specifically managed by structures called\
    \ central pattern generators. These are responsible for the basic rhythmicity\
    \ of motor control. Most of your motor system is rhythmic in nature, whether you're\
    \ walking, chewing, or scratching\u2014these actions have a rhythmic aspect.\n\
    \nThe motor hierarchy comes into play to ensure that movements are graceful, coordinated,\
    \ and smooth, and that they are appropriate for the environment. For instance,\
    \ when stepping onto a step or stepping down, there is a supervenience that occurs\
