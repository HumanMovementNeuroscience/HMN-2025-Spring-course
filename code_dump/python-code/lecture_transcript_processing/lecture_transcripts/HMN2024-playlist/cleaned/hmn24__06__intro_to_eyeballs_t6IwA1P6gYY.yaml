full_transcript: "Hello everybody, welcome to whatever today may bring. Today the\
  \ topic will be eyeballs, specifically the basic biology and neuroscience of how\
  \ your eyeballs work and connect to your brain, all that kind of stuff. We're going\
  \ to get to that, but this will be another kind of discussion, similar to the motor\
  \ hierarchy, where I have less prepared because I was making these materials. However,\
  \ this is a topic I know a lot about, and my goal is to give a large-scale overview\
  \ of all the relevant parts to vision that we can cover. We'll see where that takes\
  \ us. Next week, we'll talk about evolution, and then we'll take stock from there\
  \ because there are a couple of other things I want to get done this semester.\n\
  \nAt this point in the semester, you all are probably wondering about your grades.\
  \ Don't worry about your grades; just show up and check the boxes, and you will\
  \ be fine. The concept of grading is about ranking you relative to your peers, and\
  \ I don't think that's a valuable form of education. There is a really awful but\
  \ formative paper written in 1970 called \"Higher Education as a Filter\" by Kenneth\
  \ Arrow. The premise is that what we are supposed to do in higher education is give\
  \ you a chance to outcompete your peers so that employers can determine which of\
  \ you are the qualified ones worth the investment. That's not what I like doing\
  \ in my job. I do not care about your performance relative to each other; I don't\
  \ even know what performance would mean in this context.\n\nSo, don't worry about\
  \ it. Talk to the bot. As long as you have at least a thousand words written in\
  \ this class, which I\u2019m pretty sure almost all of you already do, you're fine.\
  \ Even if that\u2019s all you've done, you'll be fine. If there's a problem, I'll\
  \ let you know and say, 'Hey, just check some boxes,' so I can stand up to an audit\
  \ if needed, as long as I don't record it and put it online anywhere. Yeah, so don't\
  \ stress about that. I'm sure you have plenty of other parts of your life that are\
  \ adding stress, so focus on those. Education doesn't have to hurt; learning doesn't\
  \ have to be a painful process. If you feel that here, you're doing great. Okay,\
  \ where are we? I did a big refactor of the AI code. \"Refactor\" in the context\
  \ of code and software basically means redoing it, rewriting it, changing the structure,\
  \ and cleaning things out. A lot of the code I wrote was done under duress over\
  \ the past several years in various classes. There\u2019s a very important rule\
  \ that you, unfortunately, are not really prepared for; it\u2019s not really part\
  \ of undergraduate education to focus on things that last longer than a semester.\
  \ You are given what I think is a pretty flawed approach to productivity, which\
  \ is to have short-term hard deadlines: get it over with, throw it away, and start\
  \ again from scratch. If you are going to be working on something, you should work\
  \ on it a lot for a long time, and then it will get better and better. However,\
  \ that\u2019s not really how the world tends to work. Typically, things are much\
  \ more iterative, and you sort of work on the same thing over and over again. When\
  \ that happens, you can reach a point where you feel blocked by your own work. In\
  \ software, they call it tech debt; every little sloppy decision you made along\
  \ the way builds up. Therefore, it\u2019s crucial to take a step back and kind of\
  \ restart. It\u2019s a counterintuitive idea that throwing all your work away and\
  \ starting again from scratch can often be a productive way to approach your work.\
  \ When you start a project, it\u2019s more about discovery, and once you understand\
  \ the structure, recreating it with both the endpoint and starting point known can\
  \ lead to much cleaner work. All that said, I rewrote the code, and now it does\
  \ some neat stuff. Well, it has similar functionality, but now it's cleaner, allowing\
  \ for better development. One of the things I built upon was looking at data per\
  \ student, among some other things that I will show you shortly. So, let\u2019s\
  \ take a quick look at that. Okay, I'm not going to get too deep into the details\
  \ here. The most recent server thing is the same as before; just download it from\
  \ here. There might be a couple of extra things in the zip file, but don\u2019t\
  \ stress about that. Grab that, and if you open it now in Obsidian, open the folder\
  \ as a vault and paste that in. Probably actually this one. Yeah, select that. It's\
  \ white; always white. I don't know why. Actually, not always white. Always white\
  \ on this computer when I open a new one, while my other computer doesn't do that\
  \ dark mode, because light is effort. \n\nOkay, so it's quite similar to before.\
  \ The main difference is I've also changed the way I do the call to OpenAI for the\
  \ AI analysis stuff. The new way should be cleaner; it should have less slop. It's\
  \ hard to tell numerically, but generally, it should be more robust. \n\nNow there's\
  \ this server, there's this little folder called 'by user', which is basically me\
  \ going through every chat that your IDE appeared in, and it's sort of smushed into\
  \ there. I didn't really do anything beyond that. There's a bunch of files in there,\
  \ like your ID and your Discord user ID. \n\nThe other thing I did is, with the\
  \ way this weird world of AI text analysis works, you can kind of do the scale of\
  \ the text. You can be pretty goal-oriented about it. You just make kind of a machine\
  \ to analyze the text, and you throw different blobs of text into it. \n\nUp until\
  \ this point, the only analysis done was at the chat level. So at the level of those\
  \ threads, you were sort of doing summaries and pulling out things that look like\
  \ this. Part of the refactoring was making it more generic, which is often what\
  \ happens. \n\nNow, it's also set up that instead of dropping in a chat, I can also\
  \ drop in every blob of text in a particular category. So, I'm actually not sure.\
  \ This is basically like the summary of the text channels category, which is not\
  \ a very exciting one. Every folder in the category also has a thing called 'category\
  \ index', and this is the summary of everything that happened in that category.\
  \ You can also go into individual channels and channel index; it's the same thing.\
  \ \n\nThere's this multiscale thing happening here, which I think is a very general\
  \ idea in a lot of the natural world, where you have this kind of scale-free structure.\
  \ You can do the same analysis on a zoomed-in version of the thing as well as the\
  \ zoomed-out version. \n\nSo, that does sort of interesting things to it. Yeah,\
  \ so then by user, or I don't know what this is going to look like. Yeah, I need\
  \ to look at that. I don't actually see this person. It looks like this person only\
  \ has one chat, but I don't trust the code enough to trust that. So if that is you\
  \ and you have more, we'll probably clean that up. But yeah, theoretically, you\
  \ should be in there. If you look at the graph view, we again get just the white\
  \ dots of nothing until we add tags. Now we get this kind of thing. We can also\
  \ do groups, new group, and then we look for file: user ID. Then we can look for\
  \ file: channel, channel index. Actually, just do index, and we're getting sort\
  \ of this interesting kind of structure. There's still not a ton of navigability\
  \ here, largely because of how Obsidian works. But basically, I can do a search\
  \ now. In the filters, I do file: user ID. User is just a kind of generic term for\
  \ anybody using a thing. In this context, user kind of means student. I'm also in\
  \ there. But yeah, so now the blue dots here are the chats for a given one of you,\
  \ and I think if you just search for your user ID, you'll find yourself. I'll make\
  \ better ways to navigate this, but oh, come on now. Dang it. Right. So groups,\
  \ file, user, pink, bright pink. Theoretically, this is also a place that I wish\
  \ I had more control over what is visible at which point. I wish I could make the\
  \ tags have less pull than the other ones, but that's kind of a limitation of Obsidian.\
  \ This is you doing that. Oh, text fate distance be brighter. Okay, center force.\
  \ So this is now starting to get at like a map of your actual proper interests.\
  \ If I hover over one of these pink ones, which represent the students, this particular\
  \ person has interests in things like neuroscience, which are obviously very highly\
  \ connected because everyone has been talking about neuroscience. Just to be clear,\
  \ this sort of summary of a given person includes every single chat, all the text\
  \ of every chat that they have even been tangentially a part of. So if you even\
  \ just sent one message in a 50-message chat, that's all in here. It runs through\
  \ and generates a title, provides an extremely short summary, and highlights a very\
  \ short summary, and so on. So these are the things that emerge from the statistics\
  \ of what you were talking to the machine about.  And, again, that is so annoying.\
  \ A file user. Alright, it's fine. Apologies to any red-green colorblind people\
  \ in the room. For example, good old user 12830, 95453, 45953, 3792 has the main\
  \ tags that came out of them. Don't worry if your favorite thing didn\u2019t come\
  \ out, or if you don\u2019t think this is a good representation of you. Just know\
  \ that the bot is kind of dumb; it can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re excited or if,\
  \ for example, you said something and it produced a bunch of information about something\
  \ you don\u2019t care about. It can\u2019t discern that because those words are\
  \ in the data. So, this person\u201453792, which are the last digits\u2014has interests\
  \ in neuroscience, epidemiology, public health, and hallucinations. This is one\
  \ of those cases where that\u2019s the only epidemiology information that I know\
  \ isn\u2019t true. I know that you all have been discussing that, but pick this\
  \ person over here. So they are now\u2014we see that the motor hierarchy tag is\
  \ connecting these two people. All of these people... I have said enough about biomechanics\
  \ that it showed up in their message or in their summary. This is about motor control.\
  \ Theoretically, not quite yet, but this is kind of a landscape of like an interest\
  \ map. It's different; these are not because if you guys are interested, there is\
  \ a larger scale involved in all of this. This is everything that was discussed;\
  \ this was the total conversation. A lot of this could be cleaned up. Here, the\
  \ gray dots represent any chat. However, once you start looking at the statistics\
  \ of the user-based data, we begin to see things that, hypothetically, if you are\
  \ in a chat and mention epidemiology, it would show up here differently than in\
  \ the general statistics because we are now grouping by particular factors. That\
  \ particular factor is roughly one per human, which is interesting. We can navigate\
  \ that, and I need to create a better interface for navigating that, but it is technically\
  \ there. The other thing I did is related to this concept. This is the place where\
  \ I'm not going to go down this rabbit hole, although I will explore it later in\
  \ the semester. We've talked a bit about 3D space and how objects exist there. You\
  \ can have XYZ data in spatial dimensions. If you're thinking about data, if you\
  \ have up to three dimensions, you can plot that spatially by just putting XYZ as\
  \ length, width, and height, or whatever. If you have two data points in a three-dimensional\
  \ space, you can measure the distances between them, which is Euclidean geometry.\
  \ It's not particularly exciting, though it is exciting; it\u2019s probably familiar.\
  \ There is a strange corollary to this in the world of AI and natural language processing\
  \ that relates to the concept of an embedding. Basically, just as each one of those\
  \ blobs of text can be run through that summarization scheme, you can also obtain\
  \ the embedding of that blob of text within the very high-dimensional space that\
  \ the language model has access to. I won't be able to explain this in a simple\
  \ way quickly, but instead of being like three-dimensional, each blob of text that\
  \ an AI, like an OpenAI large language model processes, is embedded in a 1532-dimensional\
  \ space. Given a blob of text, it gets put into that space, and that location in\
  \ the super high dimensional space has something to do with its meaning. In that\
  \ space, you can also measure distances, and you can see that things that are close\
  \ together are similar in meaning, while things that are far apart are dissimilar\
  \ in meaning. This is how search engines work; it's a little complex. What that\
  \ means is that you can take all of the text that was generated and get these embedding\
  \ vectors, which are these 1500-long numbers. You can do some mathematical transformations\
  \ to collapse it down into three dimensions and then look at the spatial representation\
  \ of the conversations we've been having in that strange spatial dimension.\n\n\
  So, I did that. Again, this may not make a ton of sense; it will make a strange,\
  \ abstract kind of sense. But we will come back to this, and I will make it clearer.\
  \ Basically, this strange orb\u2014one of the many strange orbs I have shown you\
  \ this semester\u2014represents the three-dimensional projection of the 1500-dimensional\
  \ vectors associated with each of the chats that have happened in this class. Each\
  \ one of these little markers and dots represents one chat and its position.\n\n\
  I think how I did this was, each channel-category pair has a unique color and symbol\
  \ pair. So, all of the blue dots are things that happened in the general text channel,\
  \ while all of the purple squares are from the center of mass balance channel in\
  \ the lectures category. You can see that they tend to cluster together. The purple\
  \ dots are all close to each other, and some of the overlaps are interpretable.\
  \ For example, this orange dot is from the motor hierarchy lecture; it reflects\
  \ a chat about motor hierarchies in basal ganglia, which shows up here. By the way,\
  \ in the zip file, there's an HTML that will open the sphere part of that; it won't\
  \ show this part because I don't know if that runs from my computer. I will figure\
  \ out how to share that. But if you just open that HTML, it will just be that and\
  \ won't have this associated with it. \n\nSo, this is a chat in the channel about\
  \ motor hierarchies and basal ganglia. The one right next to it, I don't know what\
  \ it is, but it's likely related to Huntington's disease and motor control. Happening\
  \ in the general text channel, I lost some time to it this morning. This is the\
  \ Sea of Bot playground. I tried to remove some messages, and it caused some problems.\
  \ Now, there's a blob of chats that are not related to the topic of the course.\
  \ You can see they are all kind of stuffed down here in this sad little zone. I\
  \ want to remove them because that space is not being utilized.\n\nThe general space\
  \ here is called cluster analysis. I'm looking for lumps and clusters in large unstructured\
  \ data. I think the next phase will be to clean up some of the technical details.\
  \ As I mentioned before, we also have your individual user self, so it wouldn't\
  \ be too hard, though I wasn't able to do it today, to take each of your associated\
  \ text goals, calculate the vector embedding of them, and then plot those markers\
  \ on this sphere. We can look for a distance score and say, \"Okay, students that\
  \ are within this range of each other have similar interests.\" Chats that are related\
  \ might show up together. It would be similar to a recommendation system, much like\
  \ how Netflix works.\n\nAdditionally, I want to plot the individual messages within\
  \ the chat, specifically what I've been calling couplets\u2014 where you say something,\
  \ and the bot responds. That two-message couplet would be interesting to include.\
  \ This is my assignment: trying to figure out how to wrangle this large unstructured\
  \ data. Another thing I could definitely do, which I've mentioned before, is conduct\
  \ a second pass through the data. Right now, it's processing each text blob independently,\
  \ extracting various elements separately. Specifically, it\u2019s extracting the\
  \ tags independently, which is not ideal because it means there may be synonyms\
  \ that could lead to better structure. I think if I were to go through and do the\
  \ first pass, getting all the tags, then run that through and say, \"Hey AI, condense\
  \ these down into like 40 or 50,\" and then replace the ones that are sort of covered\
  \ so that there\u2019s a total of about 50 tags, then this would be a much more\
  \ structured mess. But, is that hand... what\u2019s that? So, the red dots are what\
  \ happens if I type, if I hit Groups, New Group, and in the group I type file: user\
  \ ID, which is basically just coloring all the dots associated with files that have\
  \ user ID in the name as red. If I filter by that and I say, \"Only show those,\"\
  \ then this is showing the red dots, which are the notes. Damn it, I always do that;\
  \ it doesn\u2019t remember.\n\nThe green ones are the tags, or the hashtag words,\
  \ yes. Each... I checked the number. I didn\u2019t actually connect it to your actual\
  \ identities, so I don\u2019t know which one of these is which. But hypothetically,\
  \ there\u2019s one dot per human, and there\u2019s also one dot per markdown file\
  \ in this user folder. If I turn on the tags and just view them, those will show\
  \ up as green. The ones that are connecting are those that are shared. All of these\
  \ connected red dots are people who talked about neuroscience enough to get a neuroscience\
  \ tag.\n\nThe limitations in how this is visualized are significant; there\u2019\
  s only so much I can do with it. The big ones are those that are more connected,\
  \ and the small ones are those that would be called orphans because they aren't\
  \ connected. Only this user has talked about surgery enough for that to be extracted\
  \ as a tag. So, if you ask what all of that means, it\u2019s like I don\u2019t know.\
  \ I\u2019m working on that. This is part of the joy of discovery; I don\u2019t know\
  \ either. This whole thing is basically an experiment in experimental pedagogy,\
  \ which means the teaching of children. I don\u2019t like that term because it\u2019\
  s weird. Andragogy is the teaching of adults, which I think is more relevant to\
  \ what I\u2019m considering. The distinction is that I think pedagogy is much more\
  \ hand-holding, whereas Andrei approaches teaching as, \"I'm going to teach you\
  \ how to do stuff, and then you do that stuff.\" So, Andrei's method is more suited\
  \ for adults. I don't know. This is basically trial four in my continued exploration\
  \ of how we can use AI to teach better and burn the world to the ground. But that's\
  \ a topic for later, not out of scope for this class. \n\nGreat! Okay, so you can\
  \ explore the Obsidian stuff. You can also theoretically open this HTML file, and\
  \ it will partially open that sphere. You are supposed to be confused at this point;\
  \ if you're thinking, \"I don't know what's going on,\" that's correct. We are exploring,\
  \ and confusion is the proper state when examining anything related to the natural\
  \ world.\n\nOh, and if you're a CODI person\u2014oh, you actually may not have this\u2014\
  never mind. The full server data is now 180 megabytes of just numbers and letters,\
  \ which is not currently available to you. I wouldn't really recommend trying to\
  \ dig through it anyway; it's mostly repeated text and those many instances of that\
  \ 1500-digit number.\n\nOkay, cool. So, eyeballs, right? Got that. I realized that\
  \ I actually have a video of myself wearing an eye tracker from a previous life\
  \ that I can share to remind ourselves how eyeballs look. I have put a lot of stuff\
  \ on this YouTube account\u2014John Math\u2014is probably linked in the server somewhere.\
  \ It's kind of a way for me to communicate with other researchers; the numbers are\
  \ small but consistent. However, there was a time in my life when I was making more\
  \ internet public appealing stuff, and one of those was this video of me playing\
  \ OverWatch. In my living room in Texas, that video has 300,000 views. I think it's\
  \ from a different iteration of my life where I was much worse at making these kinds\
  \ of visuals. Is it playing? I guess it's playing at full speed. This is the same\
  \ basic eye tracker, slightly different visual, and I\u2019m in my apartment in\
  \ Austin, Texas. As a post-doctoral researcher, I'm calibrating to this little laser\
  \ pointer. I used it to look at the point, and I calibrated it after the fact. This\
  \ is the data that I wish I had been able to show in real time last time. It shows\
  \ the X position; the horizontal position is in blue, so if I look from left to\
  \ right, the blue will go up and down. The orange represents the Y position. I'm\
  \ playing Overwatch, a game where you shoot characters, and I'm playing as Roadhog,\
  \ who is a character in that game. Has anyone played Overwatch? Thank you, great,\
  \ I appreciate it. Video games are really interesting; I think they are perceptual-motor\
  \ tasks because they are visually complex, but the motor commands are quite limited\
  \ and the task is often very well defined. In this competitive game, for example,\
  \ you have people trying to shoot each other. You know where the bullets go, there's\
  \ your health bar, and these are your abilities that you use until they cool down.\
  \ This particular character is big and slow and has powerful capabilities. The task\
  \ is clear: win the game and don\u2019t get shot enough to make your health go to\
  \ zero, while using the abilities to stay alive. First of all, you can see that,\
  \ as I mentioned, people don't blink when they're doing tasks that are hard. All\
  \ of these gaps here represent what's happening before the game starts, and you\
  \ can see I\u2019m blinking all over the place. Eventually, people will show up,\
  \ and then I start blinking a lot less. Here, you can go frame by frame on YouTube\
  \ using the period and comma keys, if you didn't know that. As I\u2019m coming around\
  \ this corner, I sort of glance over, and you can see the jumps down here. I'm recording\
  \ this at 30 FPS, which is unfortunate, so those little jumps are sad. You can see\
  \ here, there is a big jump in X and Y at the same time, which shows a diagonal\
  \ movement. It's going to be positive x negative y, so it's going to be, I guess,\
  \ in that direction. Yeah, so that's the first time I looked down here at the ability.\
  \ This shape is going to become more familiar because this is a diagonal down that\
  \ way. And then making a blink during an AOD, like we do, and then this is checking\
  \ the other side, which is the health bar, and then back to center. We tend to really\
  \ like our eyes to be in the middle of our head; this is our strong preference.\
  \ So when we're making eye movements in the real world, there is a pattern, a stereotypical\
  \ pattern, that if I'm trying to redirect my body in a particular direction, my\
  \ eyes will go there, then my head will go there, and then my body will go there,\
  \ and then I'll move. There's kind of a trade-off where you want to get the information\
  \ before you initiate the action, and you move the fastest moving things first.\
  \ But this is, yeah, then, so, oops, and I'm shooting this guy here. I see another\
  \ one of those shapes coming up. That's going to be, because they tend to start\
  \ from the middle, those are positional. So if the two dots are here and here, that's\
  \ going to be the same place every time. So this one is going to be to the same\
  \ location as that one, and this, you could see, 33 milliseconds per gap there.\
  \ Because I think I had already thrown the hook, and so I'm fighting this big scary\
  \ one, and I have to, like, am I ready? Can I do it again? So I look down, and then,\
  \ yeah, actually, that's that same pattern. So it's like center to the bottom left.\
  \ And then making these CADs here, so this four in a row is a big jump happening.\
  \ So that's 120 milliseconds, and you're sort of traveling, so that's a big CAD.\
  \ The actual image on my retina is blurring when that happens, because of just the\
  \ movements occurring there. Okay, I'll let this play a little more. Here we have\
  \ one, two, three, three little sads. Oh, so this is as I'm turning around a corner.\
  \ So another thing I find, I've mentioned this before, is that the amount of information\
  \ we get in a very small amount of time is enough to change our behavior. So each\
  \ of these little steps. It has four dots on it, which is about 150 milliseconds,\
  \ roughly as fast as you can move your eyes, but enough time to get the information\
  \ from that part of the visual field. Here I am blinking in this empty space, feeling\
  \ like there's nothing going on, and I have time to blink. Now I have this little\
  \ curve, and I'm not moving my head, so it's not a visual issue, but I am moving\
  \ the stick on the controller, causing the world to move smoothly. I'm going to\
  \ be tracking whatever this is, but nope, guess not. So, running up here, this guy\
  \ runs out, I shoot him. This kind of stuff here, like the swoopy things, I associate\
  \ with it; it's kind of like a visual tracking. It's the head stabilization one,\
  \ or V, where it's not a big catch-up, and it's not even a small one; it\u2019s\
  \ more of a tracking behavior. There is an object on the screen that I am smoothly\
  \ tracking, and then making these little adjustments. It's hard to know exactly\
  \ what that is, but those are sometimes called catch-up saccades. In the context\
  \ of smooth pursuit, your eyes can track the object, but sometimes they track it\
  \ a bit slower, so you'll periodically make little catch-up saccades. This is to\
  \ ensure I'm tracking this, and as it moves, my eye lags behind, so I jump ahead\
  \ to stay on top of it. You can kind of see that happening here as I come around\
  \ the corner, trying to shoot this mean ninja. Here's that same pattern again, double-checking.\
  \ I don't need to watch the entire thing necessarily, but this is a visual-motor\
  \ task I performed several years ago. I don't even know when that was, maybe 20\
  \ something, and the nature of the data provides interesting insight into the cognitive\
  \ task being performed. I had this vague intuition and intention to do this for\
  \ different characters and sort of... We get different patterns for each of the\
  \ different play styles, and it didn't quite work out because for most players,\
  \ you're mostly just staring at the center of the screen the whole time, so you\
  \ don't notice the big jumps. This particular character has a huge health pool and\
  \ slow cooldowns, which gives you that really standard triangle shape that I enjoy.\
  \ It's interesting because the ability to point a camera at your eyes and the screen\
  \ gives you a readout of the physical movements associated with the information-gathering\
  \ process that your visual system is designed for. \n\nSo, yes, here I am blinking\
  \ a lot. This is an interesting one with little jagged bits. This is what it looked\
  \ like when I was making those big turns. My head is not actually moving, so it's\
  \ not the same behavior, but it is related. I am turning in this case, but it's\
  \ kind of like my eyes are attaching to a particular part of the world and then\
  \ shifting around from there. I'll let this play out because there are only a couple\
  \ more minutes, and I'll just talk over it. \n\nI like approaching the question\
  \ of how vision works from the perspective of looking at how it is used in real\
  \ life, or, not exactly real life but a simulated version of it. In that approach,\
  \ it becomes very apparent. It's hard not to look at it this way. The concept is\
  \ tied to my post-doctoral adviser, who taught me how to use an eye tracker and\
  \ came up with the idea. Her name is Mary Heho, and her main focus is on task dynamics.\n\
  \nMary has been around for a while; I think she is in her 70s at this point, possibly\
  \ late 70s. She was one of the first people to start studying natural behavior and\
  \ how people move in real scenarios. Notice now, too, that now that I\u2019m not\
  \ engaging, Mary studied natural behavior and still does. When she started studying\
  \ it in the 1980s, a lot of people told her it wasn't possible. They claimed you\
  \ cannot study natural behavior; it\u2019s too noisy and not controlled. The data\
  \ you would get would be messy nonsense with no clear way to interpret it. At that\
  \ time, and even still today, the standard mode of research was highly controlled.\
  \ Experiments conducted with people in dark rooms, where their heads are attached\
  \ to a vice of some kind, involve very simple tasks, such as looking to the left\
  \ if the thing is blue and looking to the right if the thing is red. The idea that\
  \ Mary was going to study people who were less constrained was met with derision\
  \ because the prevailing belief was that one would never be able to obtain anything\
  \ meaningful from such data. The behavior observed was considered too complex. Mary's\
  \ approach was to focus on task dynamics, which means rather than concentrating\
  \ on the biological system alone, one should consider the context of the task that\
  \ the organism is trying to complete, as well as the factors that define success\
  \ and failure in that task. If we analyze things in that context, the data suddenly\
  \ makes much more sense. For example, if I didn't know that the health bar was down\
  \ here and the cool downs are down here, this unusual shape that keeps appearing\
  \ would appear to be just that\u2014an unusual shape. However, knowing the task\
  \ allows me to interpret what that shape represents. Additionally, if we wanted\
  \ to, we could examine how that shape corresponds to various stats and others, while\
  \ also posing questions about the speed at which these events occur. For instance,\
  \ if we find that the fastest events occur only at a 150-millisecond rate, we can\
  \ deduce that if they are accelerating that quickly, it is more important to gather\
  \ information from multiple sources rather than obtain comprehensive information\
  \ from one source. I wanted to illustrate this concept at the end of my discussion.\
  \ When I am not actively engaged in a particular task, my eye movements are far\
  \ more erratic and less stereotyped; I do not see the same shapes appearing. If\
  \ you wanted to, you could certainly come up with narratives about what I am gazing\
  \ at. Even in the same exact task and environment, you would have to make various\
  \ guesses about why I choose to look in one direction versus another. Every time\
  \ you are in a situation, you are performing a task, but if that task is not time-constrained\
  \ or particularly difficult, it becomes challenging to interpret my focus. For example,\
  \ I enjoy looking at people, particularly their faces and hands, and observing the\
  \ complete figure and body language. Research in this area attempts to interpret\
  \ data by simply watching complex tasks, videos, and people engaging in different\
  \ activities. This is related to pupilometry, where researchers track eye movement\
  \ to gain insight into attention and cognitive processes. You can get the data and\
  \ you can look at it. It's the same data type, but actually interpreting it becomes\
  \ much more difficult because you don't actually know the context of what people\
  \ were doing. I'm trying to do it in time order. Let's try to... yeah, okay.\n\n\
  So, task dynamics and the study of neuroscience and natural behavior are all good\
  \ terms to look up. Now, let's look at how there are kind of these two sides to\
  \ the question. One is how the physiological system of vision is used in natural\
  \ tasks, and the other is what the actual structure of that system is and how these\
  \ two aspects influence each other. I often tend to struggle with the ordering in\
  \ this class because these are all chicken and egg questions; there is no real linear\
  \ progression that I think makes sense. Talking about physiology absent of behavior\
  \ is just as unproductive as the other way around.\n\nSo, let's think about eyeballs.\
  \ Should I draw this? I\u2019ll get a picture before I draw it. Why are you going\
  \ so slow? Oh, it's because... come on, man. Oh wait, yeah, so... open image in\
  \ a new tab. So that's an eyeball; that's the side view cutout of the thing we've\
  \ been looking at from the front. The most important thing to notice when you look\
  \ at human eye tracking data is that we point our eyes at things and we move them\
  \ a lot. We tend to focus the center of our vision, represented by a little cross,\
  \ on the thing that we care the most about. Where's this line? I'm not sure what\
  \ that line is, but this line here is called the fovea centralis. Your fovea is\
  \ a very important part of your visual system. When you point your eyes at something,\
  \ you're directing this area at that object. It is an area of extremely high density\
  \ of visual receptors. [Music] Phobia. Yeah, so your phobia means pit, and is basically\
  \ a place where we've moved the goop out of the way so that we have a better view\
  \ of the actual photoreceptors in the eye. I mentioned at one point that your eyes\
  \ are backwards, which is true. Rods and cones - so we've heard of rods and cones;\
  \ these are the things that are... let me do this, let's zoom back out here. Okay,\
  \ so you have your eyeball, you have your pupil, and light comes into the pupil\
  \ and hits the back of your eye. The rods and cones are basically like your rods\
  \ are little sticks, and the cones are a little bit pointier. Inside of them, they\
  \ have a bunch of things, but the most important one... Okay, I have to turn this\
  \ off; I was still running that other thing. So the opsins in your eye are the chemicals\
  \ that actually respond to the light, and they look like standard hexagons with\
  \ a sort of long tail coming off of them. You have different types of opsins that\
  \ respond to different types of light. When a photon comes and hits the opsin, it\
  \ changes shape. One of the sections becomes... what if it is cis-retinal or whatever,\
  \ and sort of changes shape and gets a kink in it. Actually, I think I did this\
  \ backwards; I think it starts with a kink and then straightens out when it absorbs\
  \ light. But the idea is that the energy of the photon of light induces this change\
  \ in the physical, chemical structure of the opsin, and that changes its charge.\
  \ That charge is what sort of becomes the neurochemical cascade, the cascade of\
  \ neural firings, that leads to your perception of... Light is a weird process.\
  \ There are many options; you have short, medium, and long cones that correspond\
  \ roughly to red, blue, and green. Your rods don't have the three colors, but they\
  \ only respond to green. Your night vision relies on your rods, and there's a perinatal\
  \ shift that happens when they're transitioning from one to another. It's a whole\
  \ complex thing. Basically, the lumpy part of the rods and cones houses those opsins\
  \ in this sort of peak area. You might reasonably assume that we would want to point\
  \ that photosensitive part towards the source of light, but that is not how our\
  \ eyes are set up. The photoreceptors actually point backward, and then the wiring\
  \ attached to them goes back out. When light is coming in, it has to pass through\
  \ the axons of the neurons attached to the rods and cones before it can actually\
  \ be absorbed by the opsins in your eye. This is why the fovea exists; it pushes\
  \ that cellular material to the side so that there\u2019s an unobstructed path for\
  \ the light to get through. The idea of why this setup is the way it is relates\
  \ to when we crawled out of the ocean. Our eyes had to adapt to carry some water\
  \ with us so we could focus light better, and something in that process inverted\
  \ things. I don\u2019t fully understand that, but cephalopods, like squids, octopuses,\
  \ and cuttlefish, have their eyes facing the right way; their photoreceptors face\
  \ towards the source of light. There's another troubling aspect of this: all of\
  \ the wiring coming off the back of your photoreceptors goes back to the top of\
  \ your retina\u2014the thing at the back with the photoreceptors is called the retina.\
  \ It has to punch back through to become the optic nerve, which actually takes the\
  \ data\u2014the pattern of neural activity associated with the light in the environment\u2014\
  back through your retina to the rest of your nervous system. This means that there\
  \ is a blind spot on your retina where you don't have vision. You can find it if\
  \ you close your left eye and look at your thumb at arm's length with your right\
  \ eye. Then, with your other hand, put your thumb up and move it to where your knuckle\
  \ is while maintaining your fixation on that thumb. Watch me: I'm looking at my\
  \ thumb and I never stop looking at it. I line up my thumb here and then I move\
  \ my thumb to where my knuckle was. If you do it right, your thumb will disappear.\
  \ It takes a little practice, but for me, when I'm looking at this thumb, my thumb\
  \ is not visible in this area; it's just an empty block in space.\n\nAnother way\
  \ to do it is to hold your thumbs together. Pick the left one, and with your right\
  \ eye, focus on this one. Slowly move the other one out while maintaining fixation\
  \ on that thumb, and it should disappear. Is anyone getting it? It just sort of\
  \ evaporates. It's hard to maintain fixation on the thing without looking over,\
  \ and also your brain fills in the gap, so you kind of have to notice that it isn't\
  \ there. When you're done here, just look up a 'blind spot demo' and there are some\
  \ other resources that will show you this. It's one of those classic examples of\
  \ a blind spot where you don't receive visual information but you get information\
  \ from all around it. Because we have two blind spots and they're not in the same\
  \ area, we can fill in the gaps. There is interesting research on how, if you give\
  \ people patterns in the blind spot, the brain will fill in the pattern. So, here's\
  \ just another example of that. This chunky BET right here is your optic nerve,\
  \ which is the part that travels from your eye to your brain. When you're looking\
  \ at stuff, you're looking at it with your fovea. Peripheral Vision Wikipedia. I'm\
  \ looking for a particular image here. This is roughly speaking your field of view.\
  \ I think this is peripherally, in this central zone right here. It's actually not\
  \ going to be visible here. So this is 30, 20, 10, probably 5. So probably right\
  \ around this circle here, that's roughly speaking your fovea. You also have your\
  \ fovea, which is like a smaller area within that space, and then sort of other\
  \ zones. We have pretty wide vision; I can see my hands out to here. If I wave my\
  \ finger, there are interesting games you can play with yourself. Just kind of move\
  \ your hands until you can't see them, and then wiggle your fingers. You can see\
  \ them because we are more sensitive to motion in the periphery. Also, notice that\
  \ this is not a circle; it's not isosceles. The central part is circular, but the\
  \ whole field of view is laterally oriented because we live in a world that tends\
  \ to be laterally oriented. Our sensitivity is not arranged in a sort of circle\
  \ around our fovea; it is horizontally distributed. We are also vision-oriented\
  \ predators, so we have a different field of view than if we were rodents or equines.\
  \ Goats have rectangular eyes; mice have eyes that point out to the side. All these\
  \ cases of the ecology of how an animal uses vision in its ecological niche shape\
  \ how the visual system is set up. As I said before, I think, I\u2019m not sure\
  \ if I mentioned it today, but it bears repeating that the fovea is again roughly\
  \ the size of your thumbnail at arm\u2019s length. It takes up roughly 1% of your\
  \ visual field; roughly 50% of your visual cortex is devoted to processing information\
  \ from that small spot. That concept is called cortical magnification. It\u2019\
  s kind of why I feel somewhat comfortable with these representations. As I said,\
  \ this circle is roughly the size of the fovea, plus or minus one visual degree.\
  \ I think representations like this overemphasize that foveal perspective because\
  \ we are getting information from the whole field of view. Nonetheless, I think\
  \ it's valuable to look at the location of that directed visual focus because that\
  \ is basically an indication of the part of the visual field from which my nervous\
  \ system wanted information at this time. I think that concept is very important.\
  \ This is important because I could have looked anywhere, but I have to look somewhere.\
  \ My cognitive system makes decisions about where in the world I want to pull information\
  \ from. If I am just sitting around, those decisions are not particularly costly.\
  \ However, as the task becomes harder and I start doing more complex and difficult\
  \ behaviors, the choices of where to look, one place versus another, become very\
  \ critical. I will show this briefly. Then, I will consider our time; I won't show\
  \ this right now, but I will come back to it later in the semester.\n\nMy main research\
  \ from this era focused on the visual control of foot placement and examining the\
  \ patterns of path on the ground when choosing footholds while walking over rough\
  \ terrain. In that context, you only have about 400 milliseconds per step to find\
  \ a location on very rough terrain that can support your whole body; otherwise,\
  \ you'll fall into a river and break your leg.\n\nThere is an aspect where you can\
  \ get a readout of that cognitive question: where in the environment do I want information\
  \ from? Because we are highly visual predators, we have this nice feature where\
  \ we can point a camera at the eyeballs and use some old-school computer vision\
  \ to get the pupil center. This allows us to measure not only where the eyes are\
  \ pointing but also where my central nervous system wants to gather information\
  \ to complete whatever task I am doing.\n\nI think I can draw fast enough for this.\
  \ The internet has already drawn all the pictures I could care about. Stop it with\
  \ the AI. So, you have your eyeballs and the optic nerves that come in. There is\
  \ a part in the middle where things split apart, and that is called the optic chiasm.\
  \ Imam was an Islamic scholar in 7th century Iraq, and he discovered optics by doing\
  \ old-school physiology. Imam has been called the father of optics; he essentially\
  \ invented optics. He is credited with the discovery that light is something measurable,\
  \ allowing for scientific exploration of refraction and similar phenomena. His work\
  \ was later rediscovered by Ren\xE9 Descartes, who was one of the famous figures\
  \ associated with Cartesian coordinates. Descartes was a polyglot who spoke many\
  \ languages, and a significant part of his acclaim came from translating old records\
  \ written in Arabic into Latin. Once in Latin, Europeans were amazed and praised\
  \ Descartes as profoundly intelligent.\n\nNow, this is a model of the eye. You can\
  \ see it has the vitreous humor, cornea, and the lens. Imam got a lot of things\
  \ correct, but he did not fully understand how the lens worked. He suggested that\
  \ there was probably some demon living in there bending the light, because back\
  \ in the day, when people did not know how something worked, they would attribute\
  \ it to a little demon doing that part. For the rest of it, they could manage the\
  \ math.\n\nYou can see the different parts of the eye, along with the muscles and\
  \ other components. It's important to note that Imam's Arabic name is Alhazen, and\
  \ for some reason, that term is used in English. This is a good representation showing\
  \ how light splits, highlighting the distinction between visual fields and how they\
  \ map to different areas of the brain. I will illustrate this because it can be\
  \ helpful. We tend to think of our vision as coming from one right eye and one left\
  \ eye\u2014which is quite obvious. So, here\u2019s one eye and here\u2019s the other\
  \ eye. Oops, this is our brain as seen from above. You have the left hemisphere\
  \ and the right hemisphere. I don't know why my text stack is struggling. There\
  \ is lateralization in the brain, so your right hand is controlled by your left\
  \ hemisphere for some reason. A naive view might be to think that it's the same\
  \ for your eyes; that your left eye connects to your right hemisphere, but that\
  \ is not actually how it works. Your visual cortex is in the back, and your left\
  \ hemisphere handles the right visual field, not the right eye. If I want to know\
  \ about the things that are over here, I don't necessarily want to know about what's\
  \ going on in this eye. As I move my eyes, they will project images; from the right\
  \ side, it will project onto the left side of each eyeball. So, the projections\
  \ from the right visual field need to make it to the left visual cortex. These projections\
  \ can go straight back, while others have to cross over. If you want to know about\
  \ stuff happening in the left visual field, there is an object in my left visual\
  \ field that projects onto the right side of each eye. That projection has to get\
  \ to the right hemisphere. These ones can go straight back, and this one has to\
  \ cross over at the optic chiasm. The chiasm is actually the crossing part. This\
  \ is how the literal wiring works\u2014back in the 7th century, they would cut open\
  \ heads and look at where the optic nerve is. It was a tough thing; if you ever\
  \ find yourself in a butcher shop or a pig. If you're feeling like being weird and\
  \ gross, you can go check out the roast. It's a very fibrous and dense thing. If\
  \ you open up the head and see where it goes, you'll notice that it splits apart\
  \ and then crosses over. These little structures right here are the thalamus. I\
  \ think that is the thalamus, which acts as a way station for all your senses, except\
  \ for smell. Smell is a chemosensation, which is the sensation of chemicals in the\
  \ environment. The story goes that smell is the oldest sense; even bacteria have\
  \ smell because they detect chemical gradients. That's why it is the only sense\
  \ that doesn't go through the thalamus.  \n\nHowever, there are other things that\
  \ happen at this level, such as motion sensitivity. The whole concept of being more\
  \ sensitive to certain stimuli is at play here. Some tracks are going back to the\
  \ visual cortex, which is located at the back of your brain. Interestingly, some\
  \ of these tracks do not go to your cortex; I don't think some of them even go to\
  \ the thalamus. Instead, they might bypass the cortex and go straight into the spine,\
  \ triggering responses like the startle reflex, where visual information prompts\
  \ you to react. A lot of balance-related functions have subcortical pathways that\
  \ bypass the brain and head straight into the spine.  \n\nThis image that I was\
  \ looking for is that of the lateral geniculate body. This is generally what you\
  \ will see as the visual pathway, but remember that there are subcortical pathways\
  \ that bypass all of the big pink wrinkly parts on top. You also have a blind spot\
  \ because of your nose, creating an area in your visual field that doesn't really\
  \ receive any information, which I find funny.  \n\nSubcortical pathways are interesting.\
  \ I'm trying to check off some things here because the main concept to remember\
  \ is the visual field's relationship with the retina. They have a complicated relationship\
  \ with a lot of mirroring that occurs. For example, you'll see a picture where the\
  \ tree is upside down. Because of how lenses work, you can see that the lower visual\
  \ field here is at the top down there. There is a sort of spatial correspondence\
  \ between the anatomical structure of the eye itself and the visual field relative\
  \ to your body. For instance, if I'm sitting here moving my eyes around, my visual\
  \ field kind of moves with my eyes, but my visual environment does not. There is\
  \ a complicated interplay there. This structure is maintained as it goes back through\
  \ good old-fashioned physics and optics and into the complex neural substrates.\
  \ The spatial structure of the visual environment is sort of preserved in these\
  \ intricate and split-apart forms so that by the time you get back to the V1 visual\
  \ cortex, the visual cortex expands. I was looking for cortical expansion. Am I\
  \ not finding this picture? I feel like I'm being let down by people who put pictures\
  \ in neuroscience books. What am I missing here? Why am I not able to find this?\
  \ Retinotopy, that's the term I was looking for. Sorry, retinotopy, that's the term\
  \ I was looking for and not able to find. The main concept to think about here is\
  \ that there is a retinotopic map, kind of similar to the cartoon of the sensory\
  \ motor cortex, the horrible guy that lives in your motor cortex who has giant hands\
  \ and a giant mouth because that's where we have our most sensitivity in terms of\
  \ sensation and movement. There is also a kind of map in your visual cortex that\
  \ corresponds to your visual field, and the cartoons that we draw about it look\
  \ a lot like this. Similar to the horrible man that lives in your head, this cartoon\
  \ monster represents your sensory motor sensitivity. We love this story; it's a\
  \ great story, and it's in every textbook, and it's true to a certain extent, but\
  \ the data looks more complex than that. It's not this perfect beautiful map; it's\
  \ more of this type of thing. The representation of the brain shows that the black\
  \ spots are the pits and the white spots are the tops, so you basically take the\
  \ brain and expand it out\u2014that's what this represents. Stimulating the visual\
  \ field, you can see that there is kind of a striation that happens, where different\
  \ parts tend to correspond to different parts of the visual field, but it is complicated.\
  \ This is a very famous image; I think it may have won a Nobel Prize, I'm not quite\
  \ sure. It shows the superior colliculus of a monkey and their retinotopic organization.\
  \ What they did was stimulate little electrical signals to the cortex, which generated\
  \ eye movements that mapped that pattern. In the same way that there's both the\
  \ sensory cortex and the motor cortex paired to each other, the visual perception\
  \ system and the ocular motor movement system are also paired through these retinotopic\
  \ maps, because if I'm looking here and there's something in the periphery that\
  \ I want... To see this retinotopic location, I'm fixating here, but there's a bright\
  \ little shiny thing that shows up in the upper right. That is also the coordinates\
  \ I need to know to make an eye movement to fixate on that thing. There is a linked\
  \ map that I've been talking about, V1, which is the part of the brain responsible\
  \ for perception. This is not your oculomotor system; the oculomotor system is more\
  \ spread out and complicated. We will talk more about that in the next class and\
  \ briefly discuss it during the evolution chat. Different animals have different\
  \ shaped visual fields, but there is a complicated relationship between the physiology\
  \ of the eye and the optical characteristics of how light bends. The physiology\
  \ of the retina responds to incoming light; that's the part of your eye that contains\
  \ neurons. There is an argument that your eyeballs should be considered part of\
  \ your central nervous system because, even though we think of them as peripheral,\
  \ they perform computations on the retinal ganglion cells. Processing occurs in\
  \ these middle layers of the retina. In the retina, you have photoreceptors, the\
  \ optic nerve, and these middle layers that contain over 60 different cell types.\
  \ Some connect the photoreceptors to the optic nerve, others connect to each other\
  \ with varying distances. It was recently discovered that some of these middle layer\
  \ cells are sensitive to light, specifically blue light, and they are believed to\
  \ be related to our circadian rhythms. There are also horizontal cells that connect\
  \ them to each other. is like processing that happens here, and it has to do with\
  \ a number of different aspects. It's a little mysterious what all is actually happening\
  \ in there, but it leads to a lot of famous illusions, such as the Hermann grid\
  \ illusion. For some of you with Mac computers, this may be directly available.\
  \ For example, if you open an image in a new tab, each one of these circles is white,\
  \ but as you look at one of them, the periphery appears dark. The Hermann grid is\
  \ a famous illusion that occurs at the level of your retina because of lateral inhibition.\
  \ In the periphery, the black of the squares overlaps with the white, leading to\
  \ suppression. However, this suppression only occurs in the periphery because when\
  \ you are fixating on it, your fovea is small enough to provide adequate resolution.\
  \ There are many strange little illusions happening there.\n\nSo, I think I'll leave\
  \ that brain dump here; that\u2019s probably enough to chew on, and there are several\
  \ relevant terms to consider. You have the task dynamics in terms of actual usage,\
  \ the physiology of the eye, the concept of lateralization, the optic chiasm, and\
  \ the retinotopic mapping between your visual fields and your visual cortex. You\
  \ have the middle layers related to the strange cacophony of your retina, the blind\
  \ spot, and the various neurons involved. Additionally, you have the ocular motor\
  \ system, particularly the superior colliculus, which handles the oculomotor retinotopy.\
  \ This is about the relationship between the retinotopic aspects of your perceptual\
  \ system and the retinotopic aspects of your oculomotor system, and how those things\
  \ interact.\n\nNone of that has much to do with movement; I guess eye movements\
  \ do have something to do with movement. Often, people talk about eye movements\
  \ as body movements. Technically, they are, but the question remains about how this\
  \ information actually makes it into your body and allows you to understand how\
  \ the information... The process of getting information from your visual system\
  \ down to the parts of your brain that handle throws and catches involves the parietal\
  \ lobe, likely the parietal cortex. It also involves a range of subcortical pathways\
  \ and the corticospinal tract. I realized I misspoke earlier when I said that only\
  \ humans have the corticospinal tract; that's not true. Many animals have it, but\
  \ to varying degrees. For example, quadrupeds like cats and dogs have a very minimal\
  \ version, while animals that utilize their forelimbs more extensively tend to have\
  \ a more developed tract.\n\nAdditionally, it relates to sensation. There is a direct\
  \ mapping from your motor cortex to the spinal cord through the corticospinal tract,\
  \ which allows for a very short synaptic loop between the sensory information received\
  \ from your body and the motor commands that respond to it. This enables quick reactions\
  \ without needing to route everything through the complex network in the brain,\
  \ which can be a slow process. Things that go through the cortex can take approximately\
  \ 200 milliseconds to fully transmit.\n\nThis visual representation illustrates\
  \ the concepts I've mentioned before. Now, I will pause, and let's engage in what\
  \ has now become somewhat of a stereotypical activity in the 2024 visual neuroscience\
  \ course. In the ten minutes we have left, please feel free to interact by asking\
  \ questions regarding the topics I\u2019ve discussed. I have covered a lot of material\
  \ across different layers of complexity, so you can see how this format is evolving.\
  \ It shifts from seeking specific high-quality text to providing you with the opportunity\
  \ to filter what I\u2019ve said through your own understanding, which helps me gauge\
  \ your interests.\n\nAs we know, the system can become overwhelmed when flooded\
  \ with questions, so please give it a moment to catch up. Let\u2019s take about\
  \ ten minutes for this interaction. I\u2019ve noticed that not all chat messages\
  \ come from class time, which I appreciate. So, feel free to engage and contribute\
  \ to the discussion as we explore these concepts further. Much as you can. I think\
  \ by the end of the semester, we're getting some good structures out. Okay, cool."

  text: "Hello everybody, welcome to whatever today may bring. Today the topic will\
    \ be eyeballs, specifically the basic biology and neuroscience of how your eyeballs\
    \ work and connect to your brain, all that kind of stuff. We're going to get to\
    \ that, but this will be another kind of discussion, similar to the motor hierarchy,\
    \ where I have less prepared because I was making these materials. However, this\
    \ is a topic I know a lot about, and my goal is to give a large-scale overview\
    \ of all the relevant parts to vision that we can cover. We'll see where that\
    \ takes us. Next week, we'll talk about evolution, and then we'll take stock from\
    \ there because there are a couple of other things I want to get done this semester.\n\
    \nAt this point in the semester, you all are probably wondering about your grades.\
    \ Don't worry about your grades; just show up and check the boxes, and you will\
    \ be fine. The concept of grading is about ranking you relative to your peers,\

    \ but formative paper written in 1970 called \"Higher Education as a Filter\"\
    \ by Kenneth Arrow. The premise is that what we are supposed to do in higher education\
    \ is give you a chance to outcompete your peers so that employers can determine\
    \ which of you are the qualified ones worth the investment. That's not what I\
    \ like doing in my job. I do not care about your performance relative to each\
    \ other; I don't even know what performance would mean in this context.\n\nSo,\
    \ don't worry about it. Talk to the bot. As long as you have at least a thousand\
    \ words written in this class, which I\u2019m pretty sure almost all of you already\
    \ do, you're fine. Even if that\u2019s all you've done, you'll be fine. If there's\
    \ a problem, I'll let you know and say, 'Hey, just check some boxes,' so I can\
    \ stand up to an audit if needed, as long as I don't record it and put it online\
    \ anywhere. Yeah, so don't stress about that. I'm sure you have plenty of other\
    \ parts of your life that are adding stress, so focus on those. Education doesn't\
    \ have to hurt; learning doesn't have to be a painful process. If you feel that\

  text: "I did a big refactor of the AI code. \"Refactor\" in the context of code\
    \ and software basically means redoing it, rewriting it, changing the structure,\
    \ and cleaning things out. A lot of the code I wrote was done under duress over\
    \ the past several years in various classes. There\u2019s a very important rule\
    \ that you, unfortunately, are not really prepared for; it\u2019s not really part\
    \ of undergraduate education to focus on things that last longer than a semester.\
    \ You are given what I think is a pretty flawed approach to productivity, which\
    \ is to have short-term hard deadlines: get it over with, throw it away, and start\
    \ again from scratch. If you are going to be working on something, you should\
    \ work on it a lot for a long time, and then it will get better and better. However,\
    \ that\u2019s not really how the world tends to work. Typically, things are much\
    \ more iterative, and you sort of work on the same thing over and over again.\
    \ When that happens, you can reach a point where you feel blocked by your own\
    \ work. In software, they call it tech debt; every little sloppy decision you\
    \ made along the way builds up. Therefore, it\u2019s crucial to take a step back\
    \ and kind of restart. It\u2019s a counterintuitive idea that throwing all your\
    \ work away and starting again from scratch can often be a productive way to approach\
    \ your work. When you start a project, it\u2019s more about discovery, and once\
    \ you understand the structure, recreating it with both the endpoint and starting\
    \ point known can lead to much cleaner work. All that said, I rewrote the code,\
    \ and now it does some neat stuff. Well, it has similar functionality, but now\
    \ it's cleaner, allowing for better development. One of the things I built upon\
    \ was looking at data per student, among some other things that I will show you\
    \ shortly. So, let\u2019s take a quick look at that. Okay, I'm not going to get\
    \ too deep into the details here. The most recent server thing is the same as\
    \ before; just download it from here. There might be a couple of extra things\
    \ in the zip file, but don\u2019t stress about that. Grab that, and if you open\
    \ it now in Obsidian, open the folder as a vault and paste that in."

    \ light is effort. \n\nOkay, so it's quite similar to before. The main difference\

    \ The new way should be cleaner; it should have less slop. It's hard to tell numerically,\

    \ this little folder called 'by user', which is basically me going through every\
    \ chat that your IDE appeared in, and it's sort of smushed into there. I didn't\
    \ really do anything beyond that. There's a bunch of files in there, like your\
    \ ID and your Discord user ID. \n\nThe other thing I did is, with the way this\
    \ weird world of AI text analysis works, you can kind of do the scale of the text.\
    \ You can be pretty goal-oriented about it. You just make kind of a machine to\
    \ analyze the text, and you throw different blobs of text into it. \n\nUp until\
    \ this point, the only analysis done was at the chat level. So at the level of\
    \ those threads, you were sort of doing summaries and pulling out things that\
    \ look like this. Part of the refactoring was making it more generic, which is\
    \ often what happens. \n\nNow, it's also set up that instead of dropping in a\
    \ chat, I can also drop in every blob of text in a particular category. So, I'm\
    \ actually not sure. This is basically like the summary of the text channels category,\

    \ called 'category index', and this is the summary of everything that happened\
    \ in that category. You can also go into individual channels and channel index;\

    \ this kind of scale-free structure. You can do the same analysis on a zoomed-in\
    \ version of the thing as well as the zoomed-out version. \n\nSo, that does sort\

    \ thing I did is related to this concept. This is the place where I'm not going\
    \ to go down this rabbit hole, although I will explore it later in the semester.\
    \ We've talked a bit about 3D space and how objects exist there. You can have\

    \ to three dimensions, you can plot that spatially by just putting XYZ as length,\
    \ width, and height, or whatever. If you have two data points in a three-dimensional\
    \ space, you can measure the distances between them, which is Euclidean geometry.\
    \ It's not particularly exciting, though it is exciting; it\u2019s probably familiar.\
    \ There is a strange corollary to this in the world of AI and natural language\
    \ processing that relates to the concept of an embedding. Basically, just as each\
    \ one of those blobs of text can be run through that summarization scheme, you\
    \ can also obtain the embedding of that blob of text within the very high-dimensional\
    \ space that the language model has access to. I won't be able to explain this\
    \ in a simple way quickly, but instead of being like three-dimensional, each blob\
    \ of text that an AI, like an OpenAI large language model processes, is embedded\
    \ in a 1532-dimensional space."

    \ are similar in meaning, while things that are far apart are dissimilar in meaning.\
    \ This is how search engines work; it's a little complex. What that means is that\
    \ you can take all of the text that was generated and get these embedding vectors,\
    \ which are these 1500-long numbers. You can do some mathematical transformations\
    \ to collapse it down into three dimensions and then look at the spatial representation\

    \ this semester\u2014represents the three-dimensional projection of the 1500-dimensional\

    \ text channel, while all of the purple squares are from the center of mass balance\
    \ channel in the lectures category. You can see that they tend to cluster together.\
    \ The purple dots are all close to each other, and some of the overlaps are interpretable.\
    \ For example, this orange dot is from the motor hierarchy lecture; it reflects\
    \ a chat about motor hierarchies in basal ganglia, which shows up here. By the\
    \ way, in the zip file, there's an HTML that will open the sphere part of that;\

    And then making a blink during an AOD, like we do, and then this is checking the
    other side, which is the health bar, and then back to center. We tend to really
    like our eyes to be in the middle of our head; this is our strong preference.
    So when we're making eye movements in the real world, there is a pattern, a stereotypical
    pattern, that if I'm trying to redirect my body in a particular direction, my
    eyes will go there, then my head will go there, and then my body will go there,
    and then I'll move. There's kind of a trade-off where you want to get the information
    before you initiate the action, and you move the fastest moving things first.
    But this is, yeah, then, so, oops, and I'm shooting this guy here. I see another
    one of those shapes coming up. That's going to be, because they tend to start
    from the middle, those are positional. So if the two dots are here and here, that's
    going to be the same place every time. So this one is going to be to the same
    location as that one, and this, you could see, 33 milliseconds per gap there.

    one, and I have to, like, am I ready? Can I do it again? So I look down, and then,

    And then making these CADs here, so this four in a row is a big jump happening.
    So that's 120 milliseconds, and you're sort of traveling, so that's a big CAD.

    movements occurring there. Okay, I'll let this play a little more. Here we have

    for perception. This is not your oculomotor system; the oculomotor system is more
    spread out and complicated. We will talk more about that in the next class and
    briefly discuss it during the evolution chat. Different animals have different
    shaped visual fields, but there is a complicated relationship between the physiology
    of the eye and the optical characteristics of how light bends. The physiology
    of the retina responds to incoming light; that's the part of your eye that contains
    neurons. There is an argument that your eyeballs should be considered part of
    your central nervous system because, even though we think of them as peripheral,
    they perform computations on the retinal ganglion cells. Processing occurs in
    these middle layers of the retina. In the retina, you have photoreceptors, the
    optic nerve, and these middle layers that contain over 60 different cell types.
    Some connect the photoreceptors to the optic nerve, others connect to each other
    with varying distances. It was recently discovered that some of these middle layer
    cells are sensitive to light, specifically blue light, and they are believed to
    be related to our circadian rhythms. There are also horizontal cells that connect
    them to each other.

    \ aspects. It's a little mysterious what all is actually happening in there, but\
    \ it leads to a lot of famous illusions, such as the Hermann grid illusion. For\
    \ some of you with Mac computers, this may be directly available. For example,\
    \ if you open an image in a new tab, each one of these circles is white, but as\
    \ you look at one of them, the periphery appears dark. The Hermann grid is a famous\
    \ illusion that occurs at the level of your retina because of lateral inhibition.\
    \ In the periphery, the black of the squares overlaps with the white, leading\
    \ to suppression. However, this suppression only occurs in the periphery because\
    \ when you are fixating on it, your fovea is small enough to provide adequate\
    \ resolution. There are many strange little illusions happening there.\n\nSo,\
    \ I think I'll leave that brain dump here; that\u2019s probably enough to chew\
    \ on, and there are several relevant terms to consider. You have the task dynamics\
    \ in terms of actual usage, the physiology of the eye, the concept of lateralization,\
    \ the optic chiasm, and the retinotopic mapping between your visual fields and\
    \ your visual cortex. You have the middle layers related to the strange cacophony\
    \ of your retina, the blind spot, and the various neurons involved. Additionally,\
    \ you have the ocular motor system, particularly the superior colliculus, which\
    \ handles the oculomotor retinotopy. This is about the relationship between the\
    \ retinotopic aspects of your perceptual system and the retinotopic aspects of\
    \ your oculomotor system, and how those things interact.\n\nNone of that has much\
    \ to do with movement; I guess eye movements do have something to do with movement.\
    \ Often, people talk about eye movements as body movements. Technically, they\
    \ are, but the question remains about how this information actually makes it into\
    \ your body and allows you to understand how the information..."

  text: "The process of getting information from your visual system down to the parts\
    \ of your brain that handle throws and catches involves the parietal lobe, likely\
    \ the parietal cortex. It also involves a range of subcortical pathways and the\
    \ corticospinal tract. I realized I misspoke earlier when I said that only humans\
    \ have the corticospinal tract; that's not true. Many animals have it, but to\
    \ varying degrees. For example, quadrupeds like cats and dogs have a very minimal\
    \ version, while animals that utilize their forelimbs more extensively tend to\
    \ have a more developed tract.\n\nAdditionally, it relates to sensation. There\
    \ is a direct mapping from your motor cortex to the spinal cord through the corticospinal\
    \ tract, which allows for a very short synaptic loop between the sensory information\
    \ received from your body and the motor commands that respond to it. This enables\
    \ quick reactions without needing to route everything through the complex network\
    \ in the brain, which can be a slow process. Things that go through the cortex\
    \ can take approximately 200 milliseconds to fully transmit.\n\nThis visual representation\
    \ illustrates the concepts I've mentioned before. Now, I will pause, and let's\
    \ engage in what has now become somewhat of a stereotypical activity in the 2024\
    \ visual neuroscience course. In the ten minutes we have left, please feel free\
    \ to interact by asking questions regarding the topics I\u2019ve discussed. I\
    \ have covered a lot of material across different layers of complexity, so you\
    \ can see how this format is evolving. It shifts from seeking specific high-quality\
    \ text to providing you with the opportunity to filter what I\u2019ve said through\
    \ your own understanding, which helps me gauge your interests.\n\nAs we know,\
    \ the system can become overwhelmed when flooded with questions, so please give\
    \ it a moment to catch up. Let\u2019s take about ten minutes for this interaction.\
    \ I\u2019ve noticed that not all chat messages come from class time, which I appreciate.\
    \ So, feel free to engage and contribute to the discussion as we explore these\
    \ concepts further."

    structures out. Okay, cool.
