full_transcript: "I am now starting the recording and beginning to talk. I gave myself\
  \ some notes to reference. This is a topics course, which, as you all know, is typically\
  \ off the main schedule. Topics courses usually focus on subjects that do not have\
  \ a proper class around them yet. Oftentimes, these classes are taught to allow\
  \ a research professor, like me, to highlight their own research in a way that doesn't\
  \ fit within the standard curriculum of the university or the standard STEM classes\
  \ that you might typically take. \n\nAs I mentioned, I am technically a professor\
  \ of biology, even though I do not primarily work in biology. In this school, there\
  \ isn't a dedicated Neuroscience Department. There is the BNS program, which I can\
  \ never remember whether it is a sub major or minor. My research could fit into\
  \ a number of different departments, the most obvious being biology since I study\
  \ the neural aspects of things. Psychology would also be a more fitting department\
  \ because it includes sensory and motor control topics.\n\nThese days, I do a tremendous\
  \ amount of software development, focusing on methods building and research tool\
  \ development, which is a relatively recent development for me. I have also worked\
  \ closely with robotics, biomechanics, and physical therapy. The specific subdomain\
  \ of research that I carve out does not really fit into any particular department.\
  \ \n\nPart of the main structure of this course is to think about what the inroads\
  \ are to the specific subject I study, which I will discuss in a moment. The goal\
  \ is to provide a very broad survey of the various subtopics that come together\
  \ to form the specific domain of study, which is human movement in natural environments.\
  \ More importantly, I aim to explore my specific approach to studying this subject,\
  \ as there are many ways to study a topic, and I come from an unusual and diverse\
  \ background. This raises an interesting question about how to introduce someone\
  \ to that field. It's not just a field; it is more of a ... One thing I've learned\
  \ to do over the course of a couple of decades is to acknowledge something at the\
  \ beginning of every class that I teach. I have never found a great way to express\
  \ it, but I would not feel comfortable teaching a class full of undergraduate students\
  \ without addressing the moral elephant in the room. This is that none of this is\
  \ okay. None of the general structure of academia or education is morally defensible\
  \ at almost any level. The extent to which you are being exploited financially to\
  \ be in this room is absolutely indefensible and unconscionable. There is truly\
  \ nothing that I could ever do from this side of the podium that would be worth\
  \ the financial burden placed on you by being here. You can do the math to calculate\
  \ the number of people times the annual tuition, room, and board. The number would\
  \ come out to be something like two to three million dollars. If you wanted to be\
  \ more conservative and only count credit hours, it would be somewhere around a\
  \ quarter of a million dollars. It's absolutely indefensible and not okay. Over\
  \ the course of my four to five years, I have lost track of time as a professor\
  \ here. I have had to find different ways to handle what is termed moral harm. This\
  \ term refers to the psychological trauma that occurs when you are forced to participate\
  \ in an institution or system that is morally repugnant to you in some way. I am\
  \ here for many of the reasons you are here, which is because I love learning, I\
  \ love teaching, and I love the scientific exploration of the nature of society\
  \ as it is. To do that at the highest level, you sort of have to come to institutions\
  \ like this one for legal reasons in order to participate. It is something I did\
  \ not fully comprehend until I became a professor. You, as students, experience\
  \ life as a student, which is essentially as a temporary person in an institution\
  \ like this, with a set amount of time to be here to earn your degree before you\
  \ leave. Everything leading up to and including the point of becoming a professor\
  \ has that characteristic: first, you are an undergraduate, then you are a graduate\
  \ student. As a student, then you're a postdoc, and if you outcompete your peers,\
  \ which is an insane concept\u2014why are you trying to outcompete your peers? You\
  \ should work with your peers. Anyway, we'll get on to that. Up until that point,\
  \ there is this sort of temporary nature to it. In retrospect, it felt like I was\
  \ struggling against the system to try to succeed in that context. Then I happened\
  \ to become a professor in the summer of 2019, so I had about a year of thinking,\
  \ 'Boy, I sure did make it, and this is probably fine.' Then summer of 2020 rolled\
  \ around, COVID happened, and with all of the various ways that affected the world\
  \ at large and me in particular, I basically lost all faith in the academic and\
  \ scientific systems that summer. I experienced a crisis of conscience and was trying\
  \ to find ways to restructure my life and my efforts. I had about 35 years of experience,\
  \ close to 20 years of effort to make it to this point, which is a position of non-zero\
  \ social power. There's this general idea of 'don't give up' if you can use it to\
  \ benefit your own moral beliefs or whatever. It was a hard and challenging thing\
  \ to think about. Often, when you work within institutions, there's a conflation\
  \ between the values you hold and the institutions that are sort of the vehicles\
  \ for those values. When you lose faith in an institution, which I highly recommend\u2014\
  you should trust people, not institutions\u2014there's this whole thing of trying\
  \ to figure out what I was actually here for, what my actual goals and morals and\
  \ values are. A lot of things came out of that, probably stuff that I still should\
  \ not say on camera. The general idea was a shift of focus from doing traditional\
  \ modes of research and education. That still involves doing research for publications,\
  \ applying for grants, and producing students who will try to climb the same ladder\
  \ you are on, understanding entirely that to get tenure, you\u2019re supposed to\
  \ produce more than two people who are also trying to get tenure. Years at another\
  \ school, which is sort of the definition of a Ponzi scheme, was the effort. Oftentimes,\
  \ when you're working in these types of systems that we tend to live in, which are\
  \ competition-based hierarchies predicated on assumptions of false scarcity, the\
  \ game that you play requires you to compete with people who are at your same level\
  \ in the hierarchy in order to please those who are above you. Most of whom have\
  \ been in those positions longer, sort of a gerontocracy type of thing. I realized\
  \ that a significant percentage of the effort I was putting into the world was in\
  \ service of the people above me in the hierarchy. I was trying to do the things\
  \ they wanted me to do so that I could outperform my peers and be allowed to stay\
  \ in the warm, happy shining tower at the top of the hill where we are all currently\
  \ situated. One of the big changes, or the brain shift that happened, was deciding\
  \ to stop doing that\u2014to stop caring about or considering what I was being asked\
  \ to do by people above me in the hierarchy. Instead, I started asking what I could\
  \ do to support people who were at or below me in that same hierarchy, which is\
  \ largely all types. From a practical perspective, during that time of doing research,\
  \ I ended up with all these papers that we will talk about. With that crisis of\
  \ conscience, there was the question: Well, if universities are probably evil and\
  \ journals are definitely evil, but I do love the research and I do love teaching,\
  \ what do you do if you don't want to do the dumb work of publishing a bunch of\
  \ papers to try to make the powers that be happy, to please the gatekeeping dinosaurs\
  \ above you? What do you do with your time? Around that time, through other modes...\
  \ I mean, I had basically a big fancy lab at Richard 453, which you all will be\
  \ touring with Aaron. Not next week because I'll be out of town. When COVID hit,\
  \ I showed up with all these plans for the research I was going to do in the big\
  \ fancy lab, and they were doing the construction. The construction wrapped up around\
  \ January, and I was sort of gearing up to start the research cycle. Then quarantine\
  \ hit, and I was sent home and had to flail around for a while trying to figure\
  \ out what I was going to do with my time. What are we going to do with our time?\
  \ At that time, I wound up\u2014there were a couple of things happening in my lab,\
  \ most of which were related to the work in the big fancy map lab. Then there was\
  \ one little side project that involved a computer vision-based method for doing\
  \ motion capture with a cheap webcam in free software. When COVID hit, we shifted\
  \ our effort towards working entirely on that project because it was something we\
  \ could work on remotely with ease. That was around March, and as we got into the\
  \ summer, that project started to pick up some steam. I began to lose faith in the\
  \ system and started to come across software such as Blender. We're going to talk\
  \ about Blender; it's a free, open-source 3D animation software. It's been around\
  \ for decades, developed on a large scale, and it is 100% free and 100% open-source,\
  \ built over the years by thousands of people across the world and given away freely\
  \ as a gift for anyone to use and benefit from. I had this realization that this\
  \ was actually the thing I wanted to be doing. The open-source community is what\
  \ the scientific community pretends to be like. We pretend as scientists that we\
  \ are involved in a big global collaborative endeavor, but practically speaking,\
  \ you're just not really able to do it. Most of the research that gets done really\
  \ shouldn't be done; it's not good research, it's just smart research. It's strategically\
  \ the right move to get the publication, to get the grants, to get the job, to get\
  \ the tenure. And it often will serve\u2014I'm not saying that all scientists are\
  \ less than intelligent or that all research is worthless, though the percentage\
  \ is higher than you would wish it to be. The nature of the institutions that house\
  \ it and the realities of the hyper-competitive structures of society that we\u2019\
  ve created for ourselves mean that you're not really able to do it in a way that\
  \ benefits anybody outside of the club. When you see traditional scientists doing\
  \ outreach, it's often this kind of side thought: they might go to a high school,\
  \ show them how cool it is to be highly educated, and then just leave, hoping that\
  \ the students are inspired enough to follow in their path, out-compete their peers,\
  \ and perhaps someday make it into that shining tower at the top of the hill. It\
  \ just didn't seem right to me, so long story short, all of that kind of culminated\
  \ over a long course of time. This became, basically, did I break it? This is the\
  \ computer. There you go. So this is FreeoCap.org. This is a software that I've\
  \ been working on with Aaron for about five years. It's called Freeo CAP; it's a\
  \ free, open-source, marketless motion capture system. It's basically been the thing\
  \ that has soaked up the energy that would have been spent publishing papers and\
  \ trying to make people happy. Instead, I spent my time building this tool to do\
  \ full-body motion capture with inexpensive webcams and free software, and it's\
  \ been going quite well. We're going to talk plenty more about that. It's on GitHub\
  \ at Freeo CAP, and there's a Discord server with about 2,500 members. I think last\
  \ I checked, we are approaching 500,000 unique users in about 115 countries, which\
  \ is all quite good.\n\nThe focus of the project and the software is to use my particular\
  \ skill set and expertise, which I have accumulated over the course of decades,\
  \ mostly using taxpayer funding to pay my salaries. Rather than trying to use that\
  \ to publish super esoteric papers that will only benefit other super esoteric people,\
  \ the goal was to package that expertise to build a tool that meets a general need\
  \ of society at large. I'm trying to set up building that tool as both something\
  \ the world wants and as a tool I want to use for my research. Ideally, I'm trying\
  \ to use that as a mechanism for building bridges and pulling people in. A lot of\
  \ the users of this software are animators, often young 3D animation artists, video\
  \ game designers, and also a bunch of students, grad students, and professionals\
  \ in biomechanics and clinical fields. There are dancers and musicians as well,\
  \ and they are using this software for their own purposes. That's part of it; I\
  \ don't want to... I would rather just give you useful tools and let you do what\
  \ you want with them. However, because I, with help from Global Wei, designed this\
  \ tool from my perspective, I am also trying to make it a tool that serves as an\
  \ educational platform in its own right. It does not teach you directly; it does\
  \ not provide lessons and quizzes. The nature of the tool is to teach you how it\
  \ works and to provide a sort of greased rail into the densest part of the forest,\
  \ shining enough light so you can navigate around it. A lot of the education you\
  \ typically receive starts with the basics, focusing on the simple, often boring\
  \ material that does not motivate you on its own. You are told, \"Trust me, it will\
  \ lead somewhere cool. If you can outlast your peers long enough, you will get to\
  \ see all the fun stuff.\" I've heard the advice more than once that I should be\
  \ careful not to make it too easy to use, otherwise students won't understand what's\
  \ going on. This perspective is puzzling to me because, in the natural world, your\
  \ first reaction upon encountering something is often confusion. When you come across\
  \ a strange artifact, that initial encounter yields the least understanding, and\
  \ if you're lucky, you will slowly back into a level of comprehension. Rather than\
  \ holding your hand down a specific path with a predetermined outcome, I want to\
  \ show you a broad landscape that will likely be over your head for the most part.\
  \ I aim to provide you the tools to gravitate toward the parts of that landscape\
  \ that are most motivating to you as individuals, allowing you to back your way\
  \ into a place of understanding. You can work your way from the advanced material\
  \ in the center of the woods back to the beginner concepts with which we should\
  \ have started, grounding yourself from that position. It's such a broad landscape\
  \ that you're all going to find different parts of it, and you're going to need\
  \ different aspects of that beginner basic stuff. We'll kind of gravitate in that\
  \ direction. So, let me see where I'm at with this. There's more context. Right,\
  \ so that's the general gist of the life that I live. There's a little bit of overlap\
  \ with the class because I'm the one standing up here and you are all over there.\
  \ Specifically within this class, there is another player, which is the story I\
  \ was telling you about regarding the loss of faith and the finding of the free\
  \ open-source thing, and the reshaping around this software and educational tools.\
  \ All of that basically started in the summer of 2020 and has been progressing since\
  \ then. I've taught a couple of classes that reflect that vibe. I see a couple of\
  \ familiar faces, possibly from inquiries. Has anyone been in a class with me before?\
  \ No? Who are you people? Well, I've worked on trying to teach this type of stuff,\
  \ like this broad landscape thing, incorporating as many of these tech tools as\
  \ I could. Then, I guess it was about two years ago, in April, there was a certain\
  \ technological event that occurred, and you have heard about it. The hype cycle\
  \ has sort of come and gone to the point where you're probably annoyed about it\
  \ at this point. The thing in question is artificial intelligence. My background\
  \ is in philosophy; I have a degree in philosophy focused on the philosophy of mind\
  \ and philosophy of science. There is going to be a lot of that, specifically the\
  \ philosophy of science, in this course. From there, I got a PhD in cognitive science,\
  \ which is effectively AI studies these days. My particular domain within cognitive\
  \ science, another one of these comedically broad fields, is on the biological side,\
  \ like psychology and neuroscience. However, I also did a lot of work with robotics.\
  \ I learned a lot about AI, machine learning, and the theories of language. I have\
  \ been following various language models since roughly 2008. When GPT-3.5 came out,\
  \ I was impressed; it was clear that they had really been working hard on this technology.\
  \ Then, when GPT-4 was released, it felt like a significant shift had occurred,\
  \ and it became important to take note of it. I remember very clearly that at some\
  \ point, I reached out to my friend John Linstead, who is from graduate school and\
  \ has a background more on the AI side of things. He was a director of the cognitive\
  \ science program at SUNY Oswego for a while. We connected via Discord and said,\
  \ \"John, we need to discuss the situation.\" We both immediately recognized that\
  \ AI exists and that there isn't a need to worry about it coming to life in a threatening\
  \ way. However, nearly every source of information on the topic seems to miss the\
  \ point to some degree. As an expert, I can confidently say that many are mistaken.\
  \ This is not the endgame, and much is still to happen. The reality is that this\
  \ is a major technological shift that will definitely reshape our society in various\
  \ predictable and unpredictable ways over the next 5, 10, or even 20 years, and\
  \ not necessarily for the better. Like most technologies, it arises from technocapitalist\
  \ corporations, which are the source of many problems and harms in our society.\
  \ Just as they have caused significant damage to our social infrastructure over\
  \ the past two decades, they will continue to do so. Whenever a new technology appears,\
  \ technocapitalists rush to capitalize on it, building models around it to sequester\
  \ resources and exploit the world at large. This is the true core of capitalism:\
  \ to exploit disparities. between yourself and others to extract resources from\
  \ them. A lot of this has probably become somewhat apparent, and there is probably\
  \ at least a percentage of you who feel like, 'Aye,' because it is so overwhelmingly\
  \ tied to the corpo-technocapitalist infrastructure. However, there is another angle\
  \ to consider. It can be very difficult to recognize, especially when coming at\
  \ something from a non-expert position, the distinction between the core technology\
  \ that exists and the implementation of that technology. It is hard for us to see\
  \ things like GPT-4 from OpenAI as anything other than just another arm of Microsoft.\
  \ It is difficult to view whatever it is that Google is trying to do as anything\
  \ other than another way to steal your data and another way to shape the world around\
  \ you, like squeezing $20 a month out of you for a bunch of basic functionalities\
  \ that you will eventually require for your daily life. \n\nBut I think it is really\
  \ important to recognize that this particular technology is different. Unlike many\
  \ other tools, such as computers and phones, AI is also a world-shaping technology\
  \ that has shaped our reality. You are a part of it, and many of you are both beneficiaries\
  \ and harmed individuals from what has happened over the last 20 years. The entire\
  \ world has shifted to the point where everything we do in our daily lives is pushed\
  \ and pulled through apps created by corporations that do not have your best interests\
  \ at heart. There is an inherent disparity between the ability to create these applications\
  \ and build these technologies, which has been easy to exploit. \n\nI cannot make\
  \ this technology; I cannot create a chip. I mean, I guess I can build an app, but\
  \ it will not be the same as what you would get from Google or Facebook. They get\
  \ to take advantage of the fact that this technology is now essential. We encounter\
  \ these technologies, and we reshape our society around them. There are limitations\
  \ in this regard. \n\nI believe AI is different because fundamentally, they are\
  \ trying to build something monumental. It is a tool that will teach you. How it\
  \ works is that it will show you everything there is to know about itself, and they're\
  \ trying to corral it and control it in a way that they're accustomed to, but it's\
  \ kind of just not working in the way they expect. We'll talk about that in detail.\
  \ I don't want to go too deep down this rabbit hole because that is definitely something\
  \ I like to do, but I\u2019m mostly commenting on the skepticism that I think is\
  \ a fair response to the world we live in. I do think that AI, when used properly,\
  \ is something with the ability to be a transformatively liberating tool, one that\
  \ has the potential to make every single person who learns how to use it a more\
  \ powerful and capable version of themselves. It is not an oracle that will solve\
  \ all of your problems, which is often how it is pushed on you. It\u2019s not something\
  \ that will automatically make the world better, but it is an unbelievably powerful\
  \ tool. If you learn how to use it, whatever it is that you are trying to do in\
  \ your life, if it involves the generation, understanding, or manipulation of text\
  \ on a screen, AI can help with that. It won\u2019t build your life for you, but\
  \ it is an incredibly powerful tool with a very shallow initial learning curve and,\
  \ as far as I can tell, unlimited potential.\n\nThat leads us to Discord. I spend\
  \ a lot of my life on Discord; I wish I didn't. I appreciate the software for what\
  \ it is, but I also kind of hate it for what it is. When GPT-4 came online, which\
  \ would have been in the spring of 2023, one of the first things I did was build\
  \ a bot out of it and start using it to teach a class. I taught a summer class,\
  \ then another version of this class last fall, and a class in the Capstone in the\
  \ spring, but that didn\u2019t go so well. Now, this is the fourth iteration of\
  \ using AI. Discord AI empowers a Discord bot as a way to teach and provide users\
  \ with the ability to explore a topic that is broad, vast, and complex. We will\
  \ talk about the details of that at some point, but the basic idea is that there\
  \ is a server structured roughly around the topic of the class. Within this server,\
  \ there is a bot named Skelly Bot. Skelly is the logo and mascot of Free Mocap,\
  \ and the software has various parts, all named after Skelly, such as the camera\
  \ part called Skelly Cam and the bot part called Skelly Bot. \n\nIf you're curious\
  \ about Skelly Bot, you can click on it, and the GitHub link will take you to its\
  \ source code. The most important part of this is the phrase, \"This bot helped\
  \ me build this bot.\" I could not have made this without it. The skills and technical\
  \ aspects required to build something like this were not part of my training; I\
  \ managed to hack and slash my way through grad school and build the basics of the\
  \ Free Mocap software, which is my area of expertise. However, I have only a theoretical\
  \ understanding of AI. \n\nBuilding a tool like this was beyond my capabilities,\
  \ but AI makes it easier. You can simply ask, \"Hey, could you help me with this?\"\
  \ and it will respond with an answer that is mostly correct, though not always.\
  \ If you learn how to navigate and leverage that, you can discern when AI is right\
  \ or wrong. Understanding the AI's limitations is key; for example, recognizing\
  \ that it can handle certain tasks but not others. By navigating this space and\
  \ using these tools, you can significantly enhance your skills at a pace that would\
  \ otherwise take considerable time if you were learning from a human expert, who\
  \ would explain it to you piece by piece. \n\nAlternatively, you can learn how to\
  \ ask the machine, and it will assist you in these tasks. The process of learning\
  \ how this happens is complex; there isn\u2019t a quick answer. Like most complex\
  \ tools, the learning process involves a bit of instruction combined with a lot\
  \ of trial and error to see how it goes. This structure is part of what this course\
  \ will encompass. is to sort of give you the opportunities to do that within the\
  \ landscape of the neural control of real-world human movement. Specifically, now\
  \ coming to AI within an educational context, when I approach this as a career research\
  \ scientist with decades of experience in this rather specialized field, I find\
  \ that a lot of times if you're a standard specialist, you are in the niche of a\
  \ niche of a niche. This means you become a very specific expert. My particular\
  \ version of that is that I'm in a niche of a niche of a niche of a niche. It's\
  \ not that deep down, but it represents a breadth versus depth kind of situation.\
  \ This can be more challenging to teach because I can't assume that you all have\
  \ gone through the same background. If I were an advanced expert in the epigenetics\
  \ of immunology, I could ask, \"Have you all done introductory biology, cell biology,\
  \ etc.?\" Essentially, I need to check that you have the requisite knowledge to\
  \ reach this level of specificity and depth. With this very broad area, I cannot\
  \ assume that anyone has all the prerequisites, as I have determined that there\
  \ is roughly one person in the world with my same background. I tend to bounce around\
  \ so much that the specificity you achieve leads to a unique combination of skill\
  \ sets. This is generally good career advice; it is much easier to be unique by\
  \ combining different things. Eventually, when you look at the overlapping areas\
  \ of different Venn diagrams, you will discover that the common element among those\
  \ intersections is likely just you. This approach is much easier and more enjoyable\
  \ than trying to outcompete everyone else in the same space and domain. But you\
  \ all have found your way here, so good job! The general vibe of AI within this\
  \ class will be about engagement. So, who here has used GPT at all? Have you prompted\
  \ it, talked to it, or interacted with it in some way? Hi. It says hi back. You\
  \ ask it a question, and it says something back. The base level introduction is\
  \ that prompting large language models, particularly, are at their core language\
  \ calculators. In the same way that you would punch a bunch of numbers into a calculator,\
  \ push go, and get another number, language models do roughly the same thing. You\
  \ push a bunch of words into their context window, push go, and it looks at its\
  \ unbelievable data set and provides the statistically most likely answer. That\
  \ is the expected and desired outcome of the input to the output.\n\nI'm going to\
  \ say this even though this is a little bit off the topic, but the main thing that\
  \ happened, I think the main interesting empirical event that occurred, arguably\
  \ with something like GPT-4 versus earlier incarnations, was when I was an undergraduate\
  \ studying the philosophy of language. There was this question of whether language\
  \ requires some sort of native genetic or neurophysiological architecture to happen.\
  \ Is there something special about the human evolutionary lineage that allows us\
  \ to use language? Or is it possible to extract language from a large enough data\
  \ set using clever statistics? When I was in undergrad in 2006, it was hard to say.\
  \ Who knows? I remember at the time, there were some people who had professors more\
  \ attuned to what was going on in the field. They were saying that the statistical\
  \ people were making some interesting progress, but they were still not doing anything\
  \ that resembled proper language.\n\nWhat happened for me, from my perspective with\
  \ GPT-4, was that this question was answered very definitively. The answer was yes.\
  \ It is, in fact, possible to extract language from a large enough data set using\
  \ clever statistics without ever giving it explicit rules of grammar or explicit\
  \ concepts of words. I consider that to be an empirical discovery. From a psychological\
  \ experiment perspective, how do you know that this happened? Well, I'm a human,\
  \ and I talk to it. I'm like, \"Oh yeah, that's interesting.\" I have a conversation\
  \ with the machine, and it's clear that the machine is definitely using language.\
  \ That language is derived purely from the statistics of the data set, which represents\
  \ essentially every piece of text that has been written on the internet since 1985,\
  \ along with some clever statistics, specifically Transformer models. If you're\
  \ interested in that, you can search for it.\n\nThat's a bit of an aside, but I\
  \ think that's the situation my friend John wanted to discuss. The world may not\
  \ fully realize this. I do not hear this being discussed in this way in the highest\
  \ channels. However, the answer to that question has been empirically discovered.\
  \ You can indeed extract language from statistics.\n\nAnother thing that has happened\
  \ is that for the first time in history, we now have a secondary example of something\
  \ that can carry out a conversation. It might not be a good conversation in many\
  \ cases; it's certainly not human and it's definitely not conscious. But it acts\
  \ as a cognitive agent. It processes language and performs calculations in its head.\
  \ You've heard people say, \"Oh, it's not really doing language because it's just\
  \ using statistics to predict the best output.\" Well, I have some bad news for\
  \ you about what you're doing when you engage in language.\n\nAnyway, that's part\
  \ of the landscape of what's going on here. There's also a component, regarding\
  \ the ethical obligations I feel as the person standing in front of you and addressing\
  \ the audience. This new technology has emerged, and I don't see it being understood\
  \ or utilized at large. I feel fairly uniquely suited to teach and demonstrate how\
  \ to use it. I believe one of the most useful things I can do for you is introduce\
  \ you to this technology, show you how it works, and teach you how you can apply\
  \ it in your own cases. Even if you wind up not using it in the future, it will\
  \ still have an impact on your life from the outside. Like all technologies, this\
  \ one can and will be used against you. You should understand it to the extent that\
  \ you can utilize it to help you become a more effective version of yourself. My\
  \ job and hope is to allow you and help you do that. Specifically, the way that\
  \ I want to use it is to prompt the bot; the term is prompting. I try to get the\
  \ bot to act as a simulation of myself and my expertise. Obviously, the very best\
  \ education you could get from this class would be if I sat down with each one of\
  \ you individually, asked about your interests, helped you work through things,\
  \ answered your questions, and provided guidance just for you on call twenty-four\
  \ seven. Unfortunately, I am a limited human being, and that is not within my capacity.\
  \ Instead, I can create this bot which is not as good as having a one-on-one conversation\
  \ with me, but it's not bad. This tool will allow you to engage with it. There are\
  \ many discussions about how effective these AIs are. In the educational landscape,\
  \ the responses often seem defensive, discouraging their use for teaching, for writing\
  \ papers, and basically implying that you shouldn\u2019t cheat. While it is true\
  \ that AI gets things wrong at times and has what is referred to as 'hallucinations,'\
  \ the critiques often seem to advise against using it altogether. Indeed, it can\
  \ provide both correct and incorrect answers with the same level of confidence,\
  \ due to what is known as the grounding problem in the philosophy of AI. However,\
  \ its ability to be accurate is largely dependent on its data set. If the question\
  \ you're asking is present in the data set, it will tend to get it right. It's kind\
  \ of like a Google search; you can search for pages that exist. If you search for\
  \ something that doesn't exist, these days it will just give you a bunch of garbage\
  \ that's close by. I guess a good analogy would be imagining searching for something\
  \ that doesn't exist. Instead of showing you a bunch of stuff that's not what you\
  \ want, the answer would be that it takes the top three things you don't want and\
  \ then tells you that this is the answer to your question. It's not gaslighting\
  \ you because it truly believes the things that it says, but it is an aspect of\
  \ the model that it does not know whether it's right or wrong.\n\nHowever, because\
  \ the nature of this class is to cover a lot of different domains, most of the questions\
  \ you all will have about these fields and subfields are things that exist in textbooks.\
  \ If the answer to the question exists in a textbook somewhere, it tends to nail\
  \ it. I'm saying this based on my experience teaching classes on this topic. If\
  \ you ask simple questions like, \"What\u2019s the ocular motor system?\" or \"\
  What\u2019s the cerebellum up to?\" or \"What's up with a muscle? How does it work?\"\
  \ or \"What\u2019s the evolution of the elbow? What\u2019s the deal?\" or \"What\u2019\
  s a motor unit?\" or \"What\u2019s a Golgi tendon organ?\" it nails all those questions\
  \ because those have all been asked and answered at least ten thousand times since\
  \ 1985 on the internet, so it will tend to get it right.\n\nThe interesting space\
  \ you are now in is that, for me, I've been alive long enough to have experience.\
  \ You all don't have that yet, not because you're dumb, but because it takes longer\
  \ to develop expertise like I have. I've been studying what I study for as long\
  \ as many of you have been alive. I'm starting to get to the point where I have\
  \ a good enough sense of the landscape that I know the difference between the things\
  \ that I know, the things that we know as a species, and the things that we don't\
  \ quite know as a species. So I am in a good position to talk to the bot and push\
  \ it into areas where I know the really subtle answers, and I get to see it kind\
  \ of go wrong, go off the rails, and start making stuff up. It starts guessing and\
  \ making frankly the kinds of guesses that I see non-experts make. I don't want\
  \ to talk down about non-research professors, but a teaching professor who is not\
  \ in the specific domain of research that\u2026 What you're talking about is that\
  \ not even teaching professors, textbooks are mostly wrong. That's kind of one of\
  \ the secrets: if it has been around long enough to be written down in a textbook,\
  \ it's probably wrong at some level. At the very least, it's a cartoonized version\
  \ of the real thing, which is always going to be more complex and less stable than\
  \ you are often led to believe. \n\nOne of the many themes of this class will be\
  \ acting under uncertainty. A recurrent theme is that we know a lot\u2014we know\
  \ a lot more and a lot less than you are often taught. The nature of undergraduate\
  \ education, with tests, quizzes, papers, and grades, creates a certification system.\
  \ This system suggests that yes, you understand organic chemistry to some degree.\
  \ The nature of that process is that things are often presented to you as if they\
  \ are right or wrong, true or false. For example, what's the answer to this question?\
  \ Oh, it's B. That's not really how the world works.  \n\nQuestions can be much\
  \ more nuanced, and we will get into the philosophy of science aspect of that later.\
  \ The world is a lot murkier than we would like it to be, and this is true in science\
  \ and every field. I lost my point, but anyway, the idea is that within this space,\
  \ the structure of this class is going to encourage you to navigate these complexities.\
  \ \n\nWhat AI will allow us to do, as compared to earlier eras, is to enable each\
  \ of you to navigate a more uniquely specified trajectory through this space. If\
  \ I'm up here giving a lecture about biomechanics or neuromechanics, I have to think\
  \ about whether you will be able to follow this material\u2014if any of it is going\
  \ to land. Therefore, I have to limit the density of the things I say to ensure\
  \ that at least a percentage of you can follow the plot. \n\nIs the class over?\
  \ One thing I get to do with AI, and I think we should have time to try this, is\
  \ that it allows me to be much denser in the information I present to you. I will\
  \ be talking about things that might be over your head. It's going to come real\
  \ fast, and you're not going to follow all of it; I can guarantee you that. But\
  \ that's going to be okay because I am going to record it. Once I record it, I'll\
  \ create an outline of topics and put that into one of the channels. One of the\
  \ assignments will be to ask the bot about whichever part was the most interesting\
  \ to you, which part was the most confusing, which part you wish I had elaborated\
  \ on, and which part I mentioned that you didn't understand at all. My goal will\
  \ be to cover everything that needs to be said in a way that you can follow because\
  \ you are all smart people. Your job will be to stand in front of the fire hose\
  \ and try not to let your brain turn off entirely. Try to let it wash over you and\
  \ notice when something wakes you up\u2014when I mention a topic that grabs your\
  \ attention. Take note of those things, and then in your own time, with your machines\
  \ or whatever tools you have, explore those topics to seek deeper knowledge. You\
  \ can do that 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This thing will answer every question\
  \ you have at any point, forever. It will never get tired, never get annoyed; there\
  \ are no dumb questions. Learning how to navigate that is important. Essentially,\
  \ it will eliminate the traditional problems of student teaching, helping you jump\
  \ over hurdles and out of those states of confusion where you feel lost and don't\
  \ know which way to go. Just ask the machine, and it will provide you with help.\
  \ We have 35 minutes left, so calm down. I\u2019m deciding how to proceed. I want\
  \ to ensure that I set you up with the technical aspects, but I might also end up\
  \ dumping a lot of content on you. Of class stuff, I'm going to focus on the technical\
  \ setup. There's a whole rest of the semester left. No syllabus survives first contact\
  \ with the classroom, so if the schedule shifts, I'm honestly okay with that. So,\

    \ a professor of biology, even though I do not primarily work in biology. In this\
    \ school, there isn't a dedicated Neuroscience Department. There is the BNS program,\

    \ fit into a number of different departments, the most obvious being biology since\

  text: 'One thing I''ve learned to do over the course of a couple of decades is to
    acknowledge something at the beginning of every class that I teach. I have never
    found a great way to express it, but I would not feel comfortable teaching a class
    full of undergraduate students without addressing the moral elephant in the room.
    This is that none of this is okay. None of the general structure of academia or
    education is morally defensible at almost any level. The extent to which you are
    being exploited financially to be in this room is absolutely indefensible and
    unconscionable. There is truly nothing that I could ever do from this side of
    the podium that would be worth the financial burden placed on you by being here.
    You can do the math to calculate the number of people times the annual tuition,
    room, and board. The number would come out to be something like two to three million
    dollars. If you wanted to be more conservative and only count credit hours, it
    would be somewhere around a quarter of a million dollars. It''s absolutely indefensible
    and not okay. Over the course of my four to five years, I have lost track of time
    as a professor here. I have had to find different ways to handle what is termed
    moral harm. This term refers to the psychological trauma that occurs when you
    are forced to participate in an institution or system that is morally repugnant
    to you in some way. I am here for many of the reasons you are here, which is because
    I love learning, I love teaching, and I love the scientific exploration of the
    nature of society as it is. To do that at the highest level, you sort of have
    to come to institutions like this one for legal reasons in order to participate.
    It is something I did not fully comprehend until I became a professor. You, as
    students, experience life as a student, which is essentially as a temporary person
    in an institution like this, with a set amount of time to be here to earn your
    degree before you leave. Everything leading up to and including the point of becoming
    a professor has that characteristic: first, you are an undergraduate, then you
    are a graduate student.'

    \ is an insane concept\u2014why are you trying to outcompete your peers? You should\
    \ work with your peers. Anyway, we'll get on to that. Up until that point, there\
    \ is this sort of temporary nature to it. In retrospect, it felt like I was struggling\
    \ against the system to try to succeed in that context. Then I happened to become\
    \ a professor in the summer of 2019, so I had about a year of thinking, 'Boy,\
    \ I sure did make it, and this is probably fine.' Then summer of 2020 rolled around,\
    \ COVID happened, and with all of the various ways that affected the world at\
    \ large and me in particular, I basically lost all faith in the academic and scientific\
    \ systems that summer. I experienced a crisis of conscience and was trying to\
    \ find ways to restructure my life and my efforts. I had about 35 years of experience,\
    \ close to 20 years of effort to make it to this point, which is a position of\
    \ non-zero social power. There's this general idea of 'don't give up' if you can\
    \ use it to benefit your own moral beliefs or whatever. It was a hard and challenging\
    \ thing to think about. Often, when you work within institutions, there's a conflation\
    \ between the values you hold and the institutions that are sort of the vehicles\
    \ for those values. When you lose faith in an institution, which I highly recommend\u2014\
    you should trust people, not institutions\u2014there's this whole thing of trying\
    \ to figure out what I was actually here for, what my actual goals and morals\
    \ and values are. A lot of things came out of that, probably stuff that I still\
    \ should not say on camera. The general idea was a shift of focus from doing traditional\
    \ modes of research and education. That still involves doing research for publications,\
    \ applying for grants, and producing students who will try to climb the same ladder\
    \ you are on, understanding entirely that to get tenure, you\u2019re supposed\
    \ to produce more than two people who are also trying to get tenure."

    \ was the effort. Oftentimes, when you're working in these types of systems that\
    \ we tend to live in, which are competition-based hierarchies predicated on assumptions\
    \ of false scarcity, the game that you play requires you to compete with people\
    \ who are at your same level in the hierarchy in order to please those who are\
    \ above you. Most of whom have been in those positions longer, sort of a gerontocracy\
    \ type of thing. I realized that a significant percentage of the effort I was\
    \ putting into the world was in service of the people above me in the hierarchy.\
    \ I was trying to do the things they wanted me to do so that I could outperform\
    \ my peers and be allowed to stay in the warm, happy shining tower at the top\
    \ of the hill where we are all currently situated. One of the big changes, or\
    \ the brain shift that happened, was deciding to stop doing that\u2014to stop\
    \ caring about or considering what I was being asked to do by people above me\
    \ in the hierarchy. Instead, I started asking what I could do to support people\
    \ who were at or below me in that same hierarchy, which is largely all types.\
    \ From a practical perspective, during that time of doing research, I ended up\
    \ with all these papers that we will talk about. With that crisis of conscience,\
    \ there was the question: Well, if universities are probably evil and journals\
    \ are definitely evil, but I do love the research and I do love teaching, what\
    \ do you do if you don't want to do the dumb work of publishing a bunch of papers\
    \ to try to make the powers that be happy, to please the gatekeeping dinosaurs\

    \ were a couple of things happening in my lab, most of which were related to the\
    \ work in the big fancy map lab. Then there was one little side project that involved\
    \ a computer vision-based method for doing motion capture with a cheap webcam\
    \ in free software. When COVID hit, we shifted our effort towards working entirely\
    \ on that project because it was something we could work on remotely with ease.\
    \ That was around March, and as we got into the summer, that project started to\
    \ pick up some steam. I began to lose faith in the system and started to come\
    \ across software such as Blender. We're going to talk about Blender; it's a free,\

    \ community pretends to be like. We pretend as scientists that we are involved\
    \ in a big global collaborative endeavor, but practically speaking, you're just\
    \ not really able to do it. Most of the research that gets done really shouldn't\
    \ be done; it's not good research, it's just smart research. It's strategically\

    \ we\u2019ve created for ourselves mean that you're not really able to do it in\
    \ a way that benefits anybody outside of the club. When you see traditional scientists\
    \ doing outreach, it's often this kind of side thought: they might go to a high\
    \ school, show them how cool it is to be highly educated, and then just leave,\
    \ hoping that the students are inspired enough to follow in their path, out-compete\

    culminated over a long course of time. This became, basically, did I break it?
    This is the computer. There you go. So this is FreeoCap.org. This is a software
    that I''ve been working on with Aaron for about five years. It''s called Freeo
    CAP; it''s a free, open-source, marketless motion capture system. It''s basically
    been the thing that has soaked up the energy that would have been spent publishing
    papers and trying to make people happy. Instead, I spent my time building this
    tool to do full-body motion capture with inexpensive webcams and free software,
    and it''s been going quite well. We''re going to talk plenty more about that.
    It''s on GitHub at Freeo CAP, and there''s a Discord server with about 2,500 members.
    I think last I checked, we are approaching 500,000 unique users in about 115 countries,
    which is all quite good.


    The focus of the project and the software is to use my particular skill set and
    expertise, which I have accumulated over the course of decades, mostly using taxpayer
    funding to pay my salaries. Rather than trying to use that to publish super esoteric
    papers that will only benefit other super esoteric people, the goal was to package
    that expertise to build a tool that meets a general need of society at large.
    I''m trying to set up building that tool as both something the world wants and
    as a tool I want to use for my research. Ideally, I''m trying to use that as a
    mechanism for building bridges and pulling people in. A lot of the users of this
    software are animators, often young 3D animation artists, video game designers,
    and also a bunch of students, grad students, and professionals in biomechanics
    and clinical fields. There are dancers and musicians as well, and they are using

  text: I would rather just give you useful tools and let you do what you want with
    them. However, because I, with help from Global Wei, designed this tool from my
    perspective, I am also trying to make it a tool that serves as an educational
    platform in its own right. It does not teach you directly; it does not provide
    lessons and quizzes. The nature of the tool is to teach you how it works and to
    provide a sort of greased rail into the densest part of the forest, shining enough
    light so you can navigate around it. A lot of the education you typically receive
    starts with the basics, focusing on the simple, often boring material that does
    not motivate you on its own. You are told, "Trust me, it will lead somewhere cool.
    If you can outlast your peers long enough, you will get to see all the fun stuff."
    I've heard the advice more than once that I should be careful not to make it too
    easy to use, otherwise students won't understand what's going on. This perspective
    is puzzling to me because, in the natural world, your first reaction upon encountering
    something is often confusion. When you come across a strange artifact, that initial
    encounter yields the least understanding, and if you're lucky, you will slowly
    back into a level of comprehension. Rather than holding your hand down a specific
    path with a predetermined outcome, I want to show you a broad landscape that will
    likely be over your head for the most part. I aim to provide you the tools to
    gravitate toward the parts of that landscape that are most motivating to you as
    individuals, allowing you to back your way into a place of understanding. You
    can work your way from the advanced material in the center of the woods back to
    the beginner concepts with which we should have started, grounding yourself from
    that position.

    of it, and you're going to need different aspects of that beginner basic stuff.
    We'll kind of gravitate in that direction. So, let me see where I'm at with this.
    There's more context. Right, so that's the general gist of the life that I live.
    There's a little bit of overlap with the class because I'm the one standing up
    here and you are all over there. Specifically within this class, there is another
    player, which is the story I was telling you about regarding the loss of faith
    and the finding of the free open-source thing, and the reshaping around this software
    and educational tools. All of that basically started in the summer of 2020 and
    has been progressing since then. I've taught a couple of classes that reflect
    that vibe. I see a couple of familiar faces, possibly from inquiries. Has anyone
    been in a class with me before? No? Who are you people? Well, I've worked on trying
    to teach this type of stuff, like this broad landscape thing, incorporating as
    many of these tech tools as I could. Then, I guess it was about two years ago,
    in April, there was a certain technological event that occurred, and you have
    heard about it. The hype cycle has sort of come and gone to the point where you're
    probably annoyed about it at this point. The thing in question is artificial intelligence.
    My background is in philosophy; I have a degree in philosophy focused on the philosophy
    of mind and philosophy of science. There is going to be a lot of that, specifically
    the philosophy of science, in this course. From there, I got a PhD in cognitive
    science, which is effectively AI studies these days. My particular domain within
    cognitive science, another one of these comedically broad fields, is on the biological
    side, like psychology and neuroscience. However, I also did a lot of work with
    robotics.

    I have been following various language models since roughly 2008. When GPT-3.5
    came out, I was impressed; it was clear that they had really been working hard
    on this technology. Then, when GPT-4 was released, it felt like a significant
    shift had occurred, and it became important to take note of it. I remember very
    clearly that at some point, I reached out to my friend John Linstead, who is from
    graduate school and has a background more on the AI side of things. He was a director
    of the cognitive science program at SUNY Oswego for a while. We connected via
    Discord and said, "John, we need to discuss the situation." We both immediately
    recognized that AI exists and that there isn''t a need to worry about it coming
    to life in a threatening way. However, nearly every source of information on the
    topic seems to miss the point to some degree. As an expert, I can confidently
    say that many are mistaken. This is not the endgame, and much is still to happen.
    The reality is that this is a major technological shift that will definitely reshape
    our society in various predictable and unpredictable ways over the next 5, 10,
    or even 20 years, and not necessarily for the better. Like most technologies,
    it arises from technocapitalist corporations, which are the source of many problems
    and harms in our society. Just as they have caused significant damage to our social
    infrastructure over the past two decades, they will continue to do so. Whenever
    a new technology appears, technocapitalists rush to capitalize on it, building
    models around it to sequester resources and exploit the world at large. This is
    the true core of capitalism: to exploit disparities.'

    \ it is that Google is trying to do as anything other than another way to steal\

    \ that this particular technology is different. Unlike many other tools, such\
    \ as computers and phones, AI is also a world-shaping technology that has shaped\
    \ our reality. You are a part of it, and many of you are both beneficiaries and\
    \ harmed individuals from what has happened over the last 20 years. The entire\
    \ world has shifted to the point where everything we do in our daily lives is\
    \ pushed and pulled through apps created by corporations that do not have your\
    \ best interests at heart. There is an inherent disparity between the ability\
    \ to create these applications and build these technologies, which has been easy\
    \ to exploit. \n\nI cannot make this technology; I cannot create a chip. I mean,\
    \ I guess I can build an app, but it will not be the same as what you would get\
    \ from Google or Facebook. They get to take advantage of the fact that this technology\
    \ is now essential. We encounter these technologies, and we reshape our society\
    \ around them. There are limitations in this regard. \n\nI believe AI is different\
    \ because fundamentally, they are trying to build something monumental. It is\
    \ a tool that will teach you."

    the neural control of real-world human movement. Specifically, now coming to AI
    within an educational context, when I approach this as a career research scientist
    with decades of experience in this rather specialized field, I find that a lot
    of times if you're a standard specialist, you are in the niche of a niche of a
    niche. This means you become a very specific expert. My particular version of
    that is that I'm in a niche of a niche of a niche of a niche. It's not that deep
    down, but it represents a breadth versus depth kind of situation. This can be
    more challenging to teach because I can't assume that you all have gone through
    the same background. If I were an advanced expert in the epigenetics of immunology,
    I could ask, "Have you all done introductory biology, cell biology, etc.?" Essentially,
    I need to check that you have the requisite knowledge to reach this level of specificity
    and depth. With this very broad area, I cannot assume that anyone has all the
    prerequisites, as I have determined that there is roughly one person in the world
    with my same background. I tend to bounce around so much that the specificity
    you achieve leads to a unique combination of skill sets. This is generally good
    career advice; it is much easier to be unique by combining different things. Eventually,
    when you look at the overlapping areas of different Venn diagrams, you will discover
    that the common element among those intersections is likely just you. This approach
    is much easier and more enjoyable than trying to outcompete everyone else in the
    same space and domain. But you all have found your way here, so good job! The
    general vibe of AI within this class will be about engagement. So, who here has
    used GPT at all? Have you prompted it, talked to it, or interacted with it in
    some way?

  text: 'Hi. It says hi back. You ask it a question, and it says something back. The
    base level introduction is that prompting large language models, particularly,
    are at their core language calculators. In the same way that you would punch a
    bunch of numbers into a calculator, push go, and get another number, language
    models do roughly the same thing. You push a bunch of words into their context
    window, push go, and it looks at its unbelievable data set and provides the statistically
    most likely answer. That is the expected and desired outcome of the input to the
    output.


    I''m going to say this even though this is a little bit off the topic, but the
    main thing that happened, I think the main interesting empirical event that occurred,
    arguably with something like GPT-4 versus earlier incarnations, was when I was
    an undergraduate studying the philosophy of language. There was this question
    of whether language requires some sort of native genetic or neurophysiological
    architecture to happen. Is there something special about the human evolutionary
    lineage that allows us to use language? Or is it possible to extract language
    from a large enough data set using clever statistics? When I was in undergrad
    in 2006, it was hard to say. Who knows? I remember at the time, there were some
    people who had professors more attuned to what was going on in the field. They
    were saying that the statistical people were making some interesting progress,
    but they were still not doing anything that resembled proper language.


    What happened for me, from my perspective with GPT-4, was that this question was
    answered very definitively. The answer was yes. It is, in fact, possible to extract
    language from a large enough data set using clever statistics without ever giving
    it explicit rules of grammar or explicit concepts of words. I consider that to
    be an empirical discovery. From a psychological experiment perspective, how do
    you know that this happened? Well,'

  text: 'I''m a human, and I talk to it. I''m like, "Oh yeah, that''s interesting."
    I have a conversation with the machine, and it''s clear that the machine is definitely
    using language. That language is derived purely from the statistics of the data
    set, which represents essentially every piece of text that has been written on
    the internet since 1985, along with some clever statistics, specifically Transformer
    models. If you''re interested in that, you can search for it.


    That''s a bit of an aside, but I think that''s the situation my friend John wanted
    to discuss. The world may not fully realize this. I do not hear this being discussed
    in this way in the highest channels. However, the answer to that question has
    been empirically discovered. You can indeed extract language from statistics.


    Another thing that has happened is that for the first time in history, we now
    have a secondary example of something that can carry out a conversation. It might
    not be a good conversation in many cases; it''s certainly not human and it''s
    definitely not conscious. But it acts as a cognitive agent. It processes language
    and performs calculations in its head. You''ve heard people say, "Oh, it''s not
    really doing language because it''s just using statistics to predict the best
    output." Well, I have some bad news for you about what you''re doing when you
    engage in language.


    Anyway, that''s part of the landscape of what''s going on here. There''s also
    a component, regarding the ethical obligations I feel as the person standing in
    front of you and addressing the audience. This new technology has emerged, and
    I don''t see it being understood or utilized at large. I feel fairly uniquely
    suited to teach and demonstrate how to use it. I believe one of the most useful
    things I can do for you is introduce you to this technology, show you how it works,
    and teach you how you can apply it in your own cases. Even if you wind up not
    using it in the future, it will still have an impact on your life from the outside.
    Like all technologies, this one can and will be used against you.'
