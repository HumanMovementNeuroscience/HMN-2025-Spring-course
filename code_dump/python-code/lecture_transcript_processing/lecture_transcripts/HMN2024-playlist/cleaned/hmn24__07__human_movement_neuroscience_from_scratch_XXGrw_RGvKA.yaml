full_transcript: "Okay, all right. Hello, everybody. Welcome to this world. Today,\
  \ we're going to talk about evolution, which is a big topic with a lot going on.\
  \ We're kind of going to speedrun through a lot of details, and then we're eventually\
  \ going to get to the part that's more directly related to human movement. So, arguably,\
  \ this is about the evolution of human movement. I have no AI updates; I'm working\
  \ on some stuff, but nothing that has actually produced something shareable. So,\
  \ we'll get there. Next week or the week after, we'll figure it out. \n\nYes, let's\
  \ go ahead. I feel like there's more to say at the beginning. Is there anything\
  \ to say? The semester is coming to an end; there are two, three, or four classes\
  \ left. No one knows, maybe three after this. I think it's either three or four.\
  \ Next week, Thanksgiving week, is going to be kind of like a fake week because\
  \ I'll do stuff that will be relevant, but I know how this goes. I'll try to make\
  \ that non-essential, not that any of this is. Maybe next week will be the one where\
  \ I talk about my actual research because, hypothetically, this is not the culmination,\
  \ but once I'm done with this stuff, you will have hypothetically sufficient background.\
  \ I will have sufficient background to discuss my research without most of it being\
  \ completely new. So, we'll see. We'll figure it out. Just show up and try not to\
  \ fall asleep. But if you do, I understand you're tired.\n\nOkay, starting from\
  \ the beginning: Big Bang, boom, universe explodes. That's kind of where we start\
  \ from. The Big Bang is our current culturally preferred creation myth. Like all\
  \ good creation stories, it explains a lot, but it doesn't explain everything. The\
  \ Japanese, at one point in their history, thought that Japan was formed by a giant\
  \ sword stabbed in, and where the droplets fell, that's where the islands formed.\
  \ It doesn't explain a ton, but it does explain why the islands are the way that\
  \ they are. The Genesis vision of the world is that God made light because it...\
  \ It was dark, and then he made a bubble because the ancient Hebrews thought that\
  \ we were in an infinite ocean. So, he made the firmament for the ground and thick\
  \ stars for the top; that's where we lived. Eventually, people noticed that the\
  \ fixed stars don't move, but there are others that do move. Those are probably\
  \ planets, so they thought, maybe we're in spheres, and the planets are the spheres\
  \ while the outer sphere is made up of the fixed stars. Then Galileo invented the\
  \ telescope and discovered there was something orbiting that one too, suggesting\
  \ that maybe we orbit the Sun. As our telescopes improved, we gathered better data\
  \ and began noticing strange things, like the universe is expanding. That's odd;\
  \ everywhere we look, things are moving away from us. If you think about yourself\
  \ as a dot in a grid on the surface of a balloon, everywhere you would look, things\
  \ would be expanding. Hubble, not the person but the telescope, observed this phenomenon.\
  \ We invented devices called radio telescopes and detected something known as background\
  \ radiation. If you extrapolate all of this, you can trace it back to about 12 billion\
  \ years ago when everything would be in the same place. But what comes before that?\
  \ We don't really know. Moreover, within this cosmology, there's no way to discuss\
  \ that question. The Big Bang explains a lot, but it doesn't explain everything.\
  \ For example, if it were just that simple big bang story, we would expect to see\
  \ things slowing down, but they are actually speeding up. If we had a good understanding\
  \ of where the energy is in the universe, we could look at galaxies and predict\
  \ their speeds, but we can't; we are off by about 70%. We refer to this discrepancy\
  \ as Dark Energy. This cosmology is not entirely true, but we believe it is more\
  \ accurate than previous models because it allows us to make better and more precise\
  \ predictions, which is the essence of Carl Popper's philosophy of science. So,\
  \ the big bang explodes, and all the energy and the universe of all time is created\
  \ in that moment. When people talk about the conservation of energy, that's the\
  \ energy they are referencing. The idea is that there was a conglomeration of matter\
  \ and antimatter that obliterated itself, and the resulting energy became everything\
  \ in the universe, mostly in the form of light\u2014which is just part of the electromagnetic\
  \ spectrum. Interestingly, when this event occurred, some matter was left over.\
  \ If you're curious, Emily Noether is a notable physicist from an earlier era\u2014\
  a prominent female scientist before it became widely accepted. Who looked at symmetry\
  \ breaking in math and physics? The question of why there is anything left over\u2014\
  that\u2019s what she\u2019s talking about. But here we are; there was clearly something\
  \ left that did not obliterate itself, and that\u2019s roughly the stuff we\u2019\
  re standing on. So, a big explosion occurred 12 billion years ago, and for a good\
  \ while, everything was too hot to do anything useful. As the universe expanded,\
  \ the gases cooled down, and things started to form shapes. Your positrons, electrons,\
  \ and all your quarks and nonsense started showing up. Eventually, it got bigger,\
  \ that stuff cooled down even further, and you got things like protons and electrons.\
  \ They met up and became hydrogen, and this is where we start getting closer to\
  \ biology\u2014hydrogen, a good start.\n\nSo, those hang out in the form of nebulae,\
  \ which are big cloud-like things made out of matter. Matter has gravity, so if\
  \ you get a big cloud, it\u2019s going to start to condense on itself. The clouds\
  \ start to condense until eventually, they get so smooshed in that they get super\
  \ hot, and the hydrogen fuses into helium. It\u2019s called fusion because it fuses\
  \ together hydrogen into helium. It creates a super energetic explosion, and so\
  \ it fights against the collapsing gravity of the nebula and explodes outwards.\
  \ That sort of equilibrium of explosion and collapsing is what we call stars.\n\n\
  That is also the origin of our good friend helium, which is not particularly useful\
  \ in biology. You take one hydrogen, one hydrogen, put them together, and you get\
  \ two atomic weight\u2014that's helium. So for a good while, that\u2019s all we\
  \ have: just a bunch of hydrogen nebulae fusing into stars that are burning hydrogen\
  \ to get helium, and then that goes on for a while until some of the stars start\
  \ to burn out all of their hydrogen and are left with nothing but helium. When that\
  \ process stops, the helium stars collapse because it takes more energy to fuse\
  \ helium than it does to fuel hydrogen. But they collapse so hard that they get\
  \ so hot that they can fuse into beryllium or something like that, which is a less\
  \ energetic process but enough to fight the collapse.\n\nAnd you get new types of\
  \ stars. That process continues; they burn through their subsequent elements, and\
  \ you get basically all the chemistry that we need for regular old biology. The\
  \ top row on the periodic table\u2014what's it called? The periodic table! Yeah,\
  \ you\u2019ve got your hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium, and these are all of\
  \ our very good friends. Once you get to oxygen, you start getting a ton of water.\
  \ Hydrogen plus oxygen equals water. It's one of the most common things in the universe.\
  \ The process of stars burning through their fuel and performing fusion becomes\
  \ less and less efficient all the way up until iron. Once you reach iron, trying\
  \ to perform fusion on iron does not produce the explosive force needed to stop\
  \ the collapse of the star. Consequently, the star collapses completely. For some\
  \ sufficiently large stars, they undergo a fascinating phenomenon where, as they\
  \ collapse, they reach that fusion point for the heavier elements. It sort of slams\
  \ together and then eventually explodes in the form of a supernova. While the initial\
  \ part of this process can take millions of years, the supernova phase takes about\
  \ two weeks. This is where all the heavier elements are produced and scattered into\
  \ the universe.\n\nNow we have a universe filled with elements. These elements cool\
  \ down until they form accretion disks. Some of the materials in these disks, such\
  \ as silicates, form rocky planets. We live on one of those rocky planets. The ground\
  \ we stand on originates from those stars, so whenever you hear people say that\
  \ we are made of stardust, that\u2019s what they mean. This is step one in how planets\
  \ form, and planets are very important for evolution. They are, at least in one\
  \ case, a sufficient condition for life.\n\nSolar systems have planets; some of\
  \ them are large gas giants like Jupiter and Neptune, while others are smaller rocky\
  \ bodies like Earth and Mars. For the majority of Earth's existence, it was not\
  \ habitable at all. It was hot, filled with magma, and lacked an atmosphere. Consequently,\
  \ it was bombarded by solar radiation, which was detrimental to any potential life.\
  \ No complex chemistry could emerge in that environment because it was too violent.\
  \ However, it\u2019s important to recall that there is a lot of water in the universe.\
  \ Hydrogen is the first element, and oxygen follows closely behind. There are stellar\
  \ bodies that expel a trillion times the amount of water found on Earth every second\
  \ for a billion years. If you were to explore space, you would find a lot of water.\
  \ The rocks of water ice eventually cause the Earth to clear its orbit as all the\
  \ parts clump up together. This results in fewer meteorite impacts, which is beneficial\
  \ for life. Additionally, a lot of those chunks are ice, leading to the formation\
  \ of oceans. Oceans are incredibly useful for life because they contain liquid water,\
  \ which has a reasonable temperature range. Moreover, they are very effective at\
  \ blocking radiation. We live on the surface of our planet, relying on various forms\
  \ of air, as well as our Earth's magnetic field, which does a good job protecting\
  \ us from solar wind. Another effective solution, if you don't have a good atmosphere,\
  \ is to live underwater. If you're curious, most of the water in the solar system\
  \ is not on Earth; it's found on a combination of moons, such as the Jovian moons\
  \ Enceladus and Europa. These are ice moons with a thick sheath of ice, beneath\
  \ which we've recently discovered geologically active regions with warm water oceans.\
  \ Who knows what might be found in there? \n\nAnyway, here we are on Earth. It's\
  \ hot, which poses challenges due to radiation, but we have oceans. Once we start\
  \ to explore the oceans, we can form various substances. This goop is a good precursor\
  \ to life. I don't know much about this, and I'm sure there\u2019s more to say about\
  \ the specifics of this goop, but at some point, it evolves into more complex forms.\
  \ The advanced version of this goop is, roughly speaking, RNA, or ribonucleic acid.\
  \ While it's not specifically mRNA (messenger RNA), RNA is a crucial type of goop\
  \ because it's self-replicating. Self-replication occurs due to the orientation\
  \ of its components\u2014the hexagons, sticks, carbons, and hydrogens that came\
  \ from the stars, allowing it to make copies of itself. \n\nIt's incredible how\
  \ we acquired this goop; we understand it's simply composed of various elements.\
  \ Many of the nebulae out there literally contain ethanol; you could scoop some\
  \ up, drink it, and get drunk\u2014fancy chemistry is not hard to find. When you\
  \ put these elements together, it forms goop, which can eventually lead to the creation\
  \ of self-replicating molecules. Who knows? It might just be a numbers game: you\
  \ let things hang out long enough in an environment that's protected from radiation,\
  \ meteors, and extreme temperatures, and you end up with things like RNA. Who knows?\
  \ I know that in at least one case it is possible for certain events to occur, and\
  \ that concept is called the anthropic principle. This principle suggests that we\
  \ understand the universe is capable of creating and supporting life because, if\
  \ it weren't, I wouldn't be able to ask this question. So, in at least one instance,\
  \ on at least one planet that resembles our own, it is possible for something like\
  \ RNA to emerge. Once you have RNA, the process of evolution can begin, because\
  \ when you have something that replicates, it will replicate imperfectly. This initiates\
  \ a genetic algorithm, which is an interesting concept you might want to Google.\
  \ Genetic algorithms stem from basic evolution, centering around the idea that if\
  \ you have something self-replicating with variation, some of those variations will\
  \ be better at surviving than others. If the mutations are heritable, this process\
  \ initiates a fascinating cascade of events leading up to this moment right now.\n\
  \nSo, now you've got self-replicating mRNAs, and eventually, they form into structures\
  \ we might call cells. I will show an animation in a moment, but let\u2019s describe\
  \ this verbally for now. Cells are essentially a shell; you create a membrane, a\
  \ lipid bilayer, if you are into that sort of thing. Now, there is something very\
  \ interesting in the history of life: an inside and an outside. There's part of\
  \ the cell that is sequestered from the rest of the universe and has its own unique\
  \ conditions inside, separate from the outside, which is everything around it. You\
  \ are also similar to these types of entities. Cells remain quite simple for a while;\
  \ they don't even have organelles and just float around.\n\nAt some point in this\
  \ process, light sensitivity develops. This type of sensitivity arises once those\
  \ entities have an inside and an outside. You might say they have a sense; that\
  \ is what defines an organism. Eventually, this organism develops the ability to\
  \ sense its environment, absorb some environmental energy, convert it into an internal\
  \ state, and then exert force into the world, allowing it to change its position\
  \ relative to everything else. Hemosensation is thought to be the first sense, or\
  \ the ability to detect chemical gradients. For example, it allows this organism\
  \ to sense, \"Hey, there's food in this direction; I'm going to go there,\" while\
  \ also identifying poisonous substances. We are going to explore the sensory development\
  \ in organisms, particularly focusing on light sensitivity. It's thought that the\
  \ origins of light sensitivity can be traced back to plankton-like organisms. These\
  \ creatures might have developed mechanisms to move upwards towards the light during\
  \ the day and downwards in the dark. All you need is something in your body that\
  \ absorbs photons and a chemical process that directs movement towards that light\
  \ source. If you are in water, you may not need to move directly towards the light;\
  \ you could simply move upwards. Eventually, organisms developed a sense of directionality.\
  \ Moving forward became a useful adaptation. We started with basic cellular forms\u2014\
  such as bacteria\u2014which represent the majority of life. Many living beings consist\
  \ primarily of these simple cells or exist in symbiotic relationships as hydrogen\
  \ and similar elements. Over time, cells figured out how to engulf each other. For\
  \ instance, one organism consumed another, but rather than dying, the consumed organism\
  \ became an organelle, leading to the development of eukaryotes. As biology majors\
  \ in the room may have differing opinions on this narrative, this is a simplified\
  \ version of what I believe transpired. Eventually, these cells began to clump together,\
  \ leading to the emergence of multicellular life. This transition likely started\
  \ with simple mats and evolved into more complex structures like sponges. The distinction\
  \ between bacterial colonies and multicellular life can be quite murky. At a certain\
  \ point in evolutionary history, organisms developed openings, or mouths; there\
  \ was a clear distinction between what was on the inside versus what was on the\
  \ outside. Initially, this was like a single opening through which substances could\
  \ enter or exit, resembling a simple tube, but they were not yet fully tubular organisms.\
  \ Around this time, it is believed these early life forms inhabited geothermal plumes\
  \ at the ocean floor. This habitat offered protection from radiation and the benefit\
  \ of warmth due to the geothermal activity. Plumes are hot, and there is aluminum,\
  \ along with some weird chemistry because the geothermal plumes are spitting out\
  \ unusual substances from the center of the Earth. It\u2019s a pretty good idea\
  \ to anchor yourself near the plumes and be a peculiar, worm-like creature. That\u2019\
  s why I think it\u2019s really fascinating that when they flew a mission, they discovered\
  \ plumes coming off of Europa\u2014big geysers. They flew something like Cassini\
  \ through the plumes, smelled the mist, and found things like methane, which is\
  \ a substance that life produces, but not necessarily in a shell. On Europa, beneath\
  \ a crust of ice and a warm water ocean, there are geothermal events spewing complex\
  \ chemistry into space. But that\u2019s not the main point right now.\n\nAt another\
  \ point, someone made a super important discovery\u2014more of an organizational\
  \ principle\u2014which is to have two holes: one for in and one for out. That was\
  \ a great move, and I think we\u2019re all very grateful for it. Essentially, we\u2019\
  re all tubes with a bunch of weird stuff around us, and everything is organized\
  \ around that central tube that allows for in and out flow. This is also where the\
  \ origin of worms comes into play. Good friends, worms. Folks like C. elegans\u2014\
  there are a lot of worm enthusiasts in this department. Biology has often involved\
  \ the study of worms. When you get to a particular worm named C. elegans, I don\u2019\
  t think this is how it evolved, but you find the emergence of a nervous system.\
  \ Nervous systems have neurons, which are cells that spike. I really don\u2019t\
  \ have time to get into all the details about that right now, but nerves are very\
  \ good and useful things. C. elegans has 302 neurons, which is the smallest complete\
  \ nervous system that we are aware of. They\u2019ve been around for a while, but\
  \ eventually, moving on from there, you reach another significant point in time\
  \ regarding internal structure. You begin to see gastropods, slugs, and worms, and\
  \ eventually, you reach the chordates, which are, roughly speaking, things with\
  \ a spine. You also have mollusks, clams, and probably crabs at some point too\u2014\
  exoskeleton types. They\u2019re great, but they\u2019re not us, so we can sort of\
  \ branch off from them at some point in this process. I think maybe before the Cordata,\
  \ I'm not 100% sure on that, you get the invention of something else, which is way\
  \ less chill, which is predation. Someone figured out that if I can just sit around\
  \ making my own body my whole life, it's very hard and very expensive. But if I\
  \ just eat you, then I can get all the energy that you've been growing your whole\
  \ life, and then I don't have to do that. Somewhere in there, you get the development\
  \ of the predator-prey sort of arms race, and that is thought to be a major driver\
  \ of evolution. Because if all you're doing is sitting around sucking weird chemistry\
  \ out of geothermal vents, there's not a lot of pressure to really be the biggest\
  \ worm on the block. But if the biggest worm on the block starts trying to eat you,\
  \ now you got to start trying to figure out how to deal with that situation. That\
  \ is roughly speaking thought to be what we call the Cambrian explosion, which was\
  \ a time in the Cambrian Period where you just start seeing a whole ton of weird\
  \ life showing up. You start seeing all sorts of much more speciated and much more\
  \ advanced organisms showing up. At some point in that process, you get the bony\
  \ fish. Oh, I did shut this down; that's too bad. Um, oh look, a paper. Let's pretend\
  \ I'm not on campus. One of the many ways that the harms of places like this are\
  \ hidden from you is that when you're on campus, papers just show up. If you're\
  \ off campus, it's like pay $40 to get this paper. So, even when you're on campus,\
  \ get in the habit of just taking the URL or the DOI, going to SI Hub. The specific\
  \ URL changes, so you can just search for it. Oh, not you, MK. Yeah, this guy with\
  \ the Crow. Punch it in there, punch it in there, and there you go. It'll look different\
  \ because I have this dark mode extension that makes everything dark mode. The evolution\
  \ of gaze-shifting eye movements. I love this paper. This is a paper by Mark Land\
  \ written in 2019; it may have been his last paper. He died of COVID, which is sad\
  \ for a lot of reasons. He's arguably my grandadviser. My adviser, Mary Heho, studied\
  \ with him. He did a lot of the original work on eye movements and natural behavior.\
  \ This paper is spectacular, and it basically talks about how everything in nature\
  \ uses everything in nature that has good vision and has a sort of very similar.\
  \ The sad and fixate strategy that we have as humans represents a universal pairing.\
  \ This paper examines these movements that may look familiar to you. These are IM\
  \ movements, which correspond to head movements. When you combine head movements\
  \ with eye movements, you get gaze, which has these stable moments out in the world.\
  \ This example shows the author's left eye looking around a room. This is the kind\
  \ of work you get to do if you study these topics. He compares this to other species;\
  \ for example, there is a goldfish making a turn, and we also see head movements\
  \ in rabbits tracking something. Birds are interesting for many reasons, particularly\
  \ because their eyes constitute a significant percentage of the weight of their\
  \ heads. While we stabilize our gaze by moving our large, heavy heads with our thick,\
  \ short, stiff necks, birds stabilize their gaze with their long and flexible necks.\
  \ However, they can't make many eye movements; they still exhibit a similar sacrot\
  \ and fixate style of gaze, with stabilization occurring at the level of their heads.\
  \ You may have seen videos of people moving a chicken around while its head stays\
  \ fixed, which demonstrates this vestibulo-colic reflex (colic referring to the\
  \ head). This is a chameleon, a rock crab, and a stalk-eyed fly. They all engage\
  \ in similar strategies, using the same opsins, which are the basic chemistry and\
  \ chemicals that respond to photons and light. They all operate in roughly the same\
  \ way, responding to light, but they are relatively slow. It takes about ten milliseconds\
  \ for them to respond to light and tens of milliseconds for them to reset. If you\
  \ look at a bright light for a prolonged period, the aftereffect you experience\
  \ is due to the opsins in that area of your retina not yet resetting. Land argues\
  \ that this 'Coten fixate' strategy is a fundamental aspect of an effective visual\
  \ system. He supports this argument by discussing a scientist named Walls, who wrote\
  \ a paper in 1962. I attempted to read this paper, but it's very lengthy and lacks\
  \ illustrations, making it quite challenging. Nevertheless, I trust Mickeland's\
  \ interpretation that Walls argues there is evidence for the origin of eye movements\
  \ dating back to bony fish, which existed around 450 million years ago. Life, yeah.\
  \ This is the one I want. Open. Perfect. There we go. So, these are those fishy\
  \ guys. The way you read this is this is Earth birth. The outer rings represent\
  \ time going outward from this space. You start with these bacteria, and then these\
  \ archaea, and then eukaryotic plants show up. Plants are useful; we eat those.\
  \ They're great. They eventually turn the atmosphere into oxygen, which causes a\
  \ climate catastrophe, and things poison themselves because oxygen is really intense.\
  \ But we get over that. There's also a period of time in our history called the\
  \ Carboniferous period, which is the space between the evolution of plants and the\
  \ evolution of fungi. This is basically a period of life on Earth where plants,\
  \ specifically woody plants, are out here making cellulose, which is chemically\
  \ bonded and really hardcore. When they die, there's nothing on the planet that\
  \ knows how to break those cellulose bonds, so all the plants that die just hang\
  \ out on the ground and turn into things like petrified wood. There were apparently\
  \ wildfires that were the size of continents because forests would die and just\
  \ never go anywhere. They also turn into all fossil fuels. All the fossil fuels\
  \ on the planet, these repositories of rarified carbon, hydrocarbons, oil, coal,\
  \ and stuff like that come from that gap period. It's typically things like bogs\
  \ and swamps because the plant matter would die but wouldn't be broken up and re-enter\
  \ the ecosystem; it would just sequester there. So, fossil fuel is super useful;\
  \ you can do a lot of stuff with it, but there are some problems with using it too\
  \ much, too fast. We'll see how that goes. Eventually, fungi show up, and they learn\
  \ how to eat cellulose. So, the Carboniferous period ends, and now trees can rot\
  \ and go back into the carbon cycle. Thanks, Proto-stes. These are your weirdos.\
  \ This is like the weird Cambrian species. If you ever look at old animals, they're\
  \ weird as hell. They have... There are weird spirals and spiral-mouthed creatures\
  \ from the Cambrian explosion era. You can see how things spike out. There were\
  \ ice ages and mass extinction events; there have been several mass extinctions.\
  \ But right around here, we have bony fish, which were the first creatures to make\
  \ eye movements. Presumably, some other organisms may have done so as well. However,\
  \ bones and shells make good fossils, while slugs do not, so there were likely creatures\
  \ with eye stalks and similar features. Bony fish have skeletons, spines, and muscles,\
  \ and those muscles are attached to their eyeballs, allowing for eye movements.\
  \ Around this time, bony fish were doing great biologically. Eventually, certain\
  \ species decided to leave the ocean because it became too crowded and predators\
  \ were constantly eating them. So someone crawled out onto land. This creature was\
  \ thought to be similar to a mudskipper; it would go out, lay eggs, and return to\
  \ the water. This behavior helps protect their eggs from being eaten, as the only\
  \ things on the ground were plants, which do not consume other organisms. They simply\
  \ absorb light and carry out photosynthesis, which is super inefficient but effective.\
  \ Eventually, these organisms adapted to life on land, transforming their flippers\
  \ into hands and their back flippers into feet, allowing them to crawl around. They\
  \ became lizard-like creatures, marking the emergence of tetrapods. Tetrapods have\
  \ a specific shape: head, torso, upper arms, lower limbs, and an optional tail,\
  \ which is essentially a spine. These creatures existed for a long time, and then\
  \ evolved into dinosaurs and birds. Birds are essentially the first bipedal creatures;\
  \ they beat us to the punch by around 200 million years and are better at bipedalism\
  \ than we are. I spent a lot of time in graduate school arguing otherwise, but I\
  \ have come to terms with the fact that 200 million years of evolution equips you\
  \ for effective bipedal movement. Birds have very short femurs, long shanks, and\
  \ a specific toe joint structure. They do not have backward knees; instead, their\
  \ knees are positioned higher up. Usually in their plumage, so that's fine. They\
  \ hang out for a while. You have your two-legged dinosaurs, and then you have your\
  \ quadrupedal dinosaurs. They coexist for a good long time. Eventually, one of these\
  \ mass extinctions occurs. You get phenomena like the Gulf of Mexico as a result,\
  \ and all the dinosaurs tend to die off or evolve into birds. Those are their options:\
  \ a lot of them chose death, and some chose to become birds, for which we are grateful.\
  \ We trust them to make those decisions for themselves.\n\nNow, amongst the little\
  \ crawly boys, some of them were developing traits like fur and warm blood. The\
  \ first mammals were basically tree shrew-like creatures, sort of resembling squirrels\
  \ that hung out in trees. These arboreal mammals moved around on branches. This\
  \ was a great adaptation because, if you're hanging out on branches, you need to\
  \ have grasping abilities, as the trees are very thin. As these creatures ran around\
  \ the tops of trees, trying to avoid being eaten by dinosaurs, they were small and\
  \ did not require much food. Being warm-blooded made them more resilient to massive\
  \ climate upheavals. As the dinosaurs were dying off due to events like the formation\
  \ of the Gulf of Mexico, these early mammals thrived.\n\nAs they navigated the trees\
  \ with their little hands and feet, eventually they evolved into forms that were\
  \ more recognizable. You get all sorts of interesting species, including platypuses\
  \ and aardvarks, as well as other strange animals. Eventually, you get to creatures\
  \ that can be classified as primates\u2014essentially, these are advanced tree shrews.\
  \ I\u2019m not sure exactly what to say about that transition, other than that we\
  \ did it.  We will go into more detail about that particular transition.\n\nWe start\
  \ off as arboreal creatures, walking around in trees with grasping hands, and primates,\
  \ I\u2019m not sure what the exact term is, oscillate between different habitats,\
  \ but they largely remain in the trees. Trees come down to the ground. They are\
  \ not very good at being bipeds; they can stand upright, but their skeletons aren't\
  \ really shaped right, so they are knuckle walkers. They are primarily quadrupedal,\
  \ using these grasping appendages. This is kind of how they move. We will go into\
  \ quite some detail about that later.\n\nSo now, we have transitioned from roughly\
  \ the Big Bang down to these grabby tree shrews. This is a very pivotal point. We\
  \ are mammals, and the creature we are discussing now, along with its predecessors\
  \ from probably about 20 million years ago, represents a significant stage in my\
  \ childhood memories. It\u2019s interesting to think back to that time.\n\nThis\
  \ mammal possesses a mammalian nervous system; it has roughly the same components\
  \ as yours. It is a funhouse mirror version of you \u2013 some parts are larger,\
  \ some are smaller, but this creature has a similar skeleton, similar organs, and\
  \ a similar nervous system. Essentially, everything from this point on is just variations\
  \ or adaptations of these basic elements.\n\nAs for this particular mammal, I want\
  \ to introduce you to Carl Sagan. Carl Sagan is one of my favorite science communicators\
  \ of all time. He has this show called Cosmos, which I highly recommend. It's quite\
  \ dated, so you will need to overlook the fact that it was made in the 1980s. However,\
  \ if you appreciate the existential anxiety component of this class, it will resonate\
  \ with you because it deals with coming to terms with our human limitations.\n\n\
  The show includes a very famous animation that I will present to you. It displays\
  \ what has changed over time. By the way, this speed run from the birth of time\
  \ to the evolution of humans is a classic format and is inspired by this concept.\
  \ How well do you know your origins? Myth. No, no, no, let's do it on YouTube. No,\
  \ not that, even minute one, there you go. So, no, no, lipid bilayer, organelles,\
  \ UK, carrots, multicellular stuff. This is the mouth, that's The Rock, these are\
  \ the guys that hang out by the geothermal vents. They become kind of worms. This\
  \ is the fish with the bony fish skeletons, eye movements, crawling out of the water,\
  \ lizard guy. Demetron, some sort of treeshrew. This is your treeshrew. These are\
  \ your old school apes with tails. These are your new school apes without tails.\
  \ They stand up, they walk around. Hello, now we're here, we did it! And as he says,\
  \ these are some of the things that molecules do given 12 billion years of evolution.\
  \ Ta-da! The Cosmic Calendar is how he did it, and this little pixel right down\
  \ here, that's all of life on Earth. Yeah, you dive into that pool at your leisure;\
  \ it is your birthright. Okay, so after the treeshrews, we get the apes. Apes and\
  \ monkeys, monkeys and apes. The term \"monkey\" is not an evolutionarily distinct\
  \ thing. It, um, evolutionarily...actually, I can do this. I don't need to draw\
  \ this. Primates: old school, Old World, New World. So, notice the Eurocentric imperialism\
  \ in the naming conventions here. But you have your old school monkeys\u2014Old\
  \ World monkeys refer to Africa, New World monkeys refer to the Americas, and the\
  \ old world monkeys, the other ones are you... Got your MAAC? When we do research\
  \ on non-human primates, it's typically MAACs\u2014that's your baboons and whatnot.\
  \ Then you have your apes, which include gibbons and orangutans. We also have the\
  \ great apes, which include gorillas, bonobos, and chimpanzees. The term \"monkey\"\
  \ isn't included here except in the distinction between Old World and New World\
  \ monkeys. Monkeys don't actually exist phylogenetically; if they did, we would\
  \ all be monkeys. I mostly just use this to counter anyone who says we are not monkeys\
  \ because we are apes; I can hit them with that if I choose. Now, let's see how\
  \ we can go forward. I know that they have a bunch of skulls. We start from the\
  \ past and move toward the future. This is actually starting a little later than\
  \ I would prefer. This individual here is Australopithecus afarensis, often referred\
  \ to as \"Lucy.\" You may have heard about this cool lady named Lucy; she is roughly\
  \ speaking a bipedal ape. The actual Lucy that we refer to is a skeleton that we\
  \ found\u2014 I think this was actually at UT Austin, but I'm not quite sure. Typically,\
  \ when we discover these remains, they are not complete; we don't find them looking\
  \ like this. We find little chunks and pieces. Lucy, in particular, is notable because\
  \ we got a very complete skeleton, which is rare in the fossil record. Lucy became\
  \ famous because of that, but there are many of these sort of bipedal, ape-like\
  \ creatures. We keep finding new ones. You can tell the genus by the first word\
  \ and the species by the second one. We are Homo sapiens, but then we have all these\
  \ other ones. Australopithecus is a particular genus. But it gets murky. The separation\
  \ is hard to really carve out because you usually get these bone chunks, and you\
  \ keep finding new ones. We recently found a ton of hominins; we found a cave that\
  \ was just stuffed full of them. Google it; it's great. The research team had to\
  \ be a bunch of really tiny people because they had to crawl in through the small\
  \ spelunking holes. But anyway, let's go back one step further and talk about Ardipithecus\
  \ ramidus. Ardipithecus ramidus is less popular than Lucy, but still pretty significant.\
  \ Ardipithecus ramidus means the grounded ape. This is thought to be the last common\
  \ ancestor that we share with the other great apes. So, Lucy is not in the family\
  \ tree of chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas, but Ardipithecus ramidus is. Ardi\
  \ was able to stand up pretty well and had some sort of pelvis, which we'll talk\
  \ about in a second. However, Ardi wasn\u2019t particularly well adapted as a biped.\
  \ Notice the feet; they had these grasping feet. Unfortunately, this is going to\
  \ be the class where I take my shoes off\u2014not quite yet. But if you'll notice\
  \ the grabby feet, it indicates that this individual was thought to be a sort of\
  \ a maladapted biped. Speaking of Africa, you may have heard of that place where\
  \ we're from. Lucy was found in the Olduvai Gorge, which is in Tanzania. This right\
  \ here is called the Great Rift Valley or something similar. It is geologically\
  \ very active and sort of pulls apart and pushes together over the scale of thousands\
  \ of years. Periodically, it becomes an area with a bunch of rivers and lakes, and\
  \ then it will push together and become land. If you are an arboreal individual\
  \ living in the jungle, sometimes you might need to come down from the trees and\
  \ walk from one clump of trees to another. To do that, you might have to cross plains\
  \ where there are things like lions, so it's probably good to be a little better\
  \ at walking. This way, you can go from one tree copse to another without getting\
  \ eaten. The second you start doing that, you begin to develop these very well-evolved\
  \ appendages that we've been evolving for millions of years. But for some of your\
  \ life, you're not actually using them for anything. They're there, they're attached,\
  \ and they're good at grabbing. They are very much tied to our perceptual system\
  \ because of our arboreal origins, but we're no longer using them for locomotion.\
  \ This seems like a bold move, kind of like being a skateboard. It's just not relevant.\
  \ So, Ardi is thought to be kind of like the beginning of the evolution of obligate\
  \ bipedalism. 'Obligate' means that we don\u2019t really have many other choices\
  \ here. For example, bears, chimps, and gorillas are mostly knuckle walkers, but\
  \ they can stand up on two feet. We kind of struggle with everything except bipedalism,\
  \ so we are obligate bipeds. There\u2019s this great paper by Co. Lovejoy, a paleontologist\
  \ who does a lot of work on human evolution. He wrote a three-part paper on the\
  \ evolution of human gait and posture, discussing the spine, pelvis, femur, and\
  \ knee. A lot of what I\u2019ll be saying about the skeleton is based on that. He\
  \ also wrote this great paper about Ardipithecus ramidus in 2009, because Ardi was\
  \ discovered relatively recently. You'll hear this thing every so often: we found\
  \ a missing link. It's like, yeah, we found another one. In his paper about the\
  \ evolution of bipedalism, he has perhaps my favorite section - my favorite paragraph\
  \ I've ever read. One of the things that often happens in this area of research\
  \ is that everyone is always trying to figure out what our history says about us\
  \ now. One of the core essential questions is, are we just inherently violent monsters\
  \ by nature, or is the caring and kindness part of us also a core aspect of our\
  \ being? Are we fighting against our nature when we show care and kindness, or is\
  \ that inbuilt as much as the violence and death? If we look at our nearest cousins,\
  \ the chimpanzees and bonobos, chimpanzees are relatively violent creatures. I'm\
  \ not going to talk too much about it, but perhaps my favorite living scientist,\
  \ Jane Goodall, did a lot of important work in discovering that chimpanzees are\
  \ not just purely violent; they have complex social structures. The story of how\
  \ that process unfolded is one of my favorites, but I'm not going to delve into\
  \ it too deeply right now. Generally speaking, chimps are very violent, while bonobos\
  \ tend to solve their problems through gentler means. This brings up the question\
  \ of where we really fit in. We are separated from them; we didn't evolve from either\
  \ chimpanzees or bonobos, but we are part of the same family.\n\nThis paragraph\
  \ here is asking about how the origins of bipedalism play into the story of inherent\
  \ violence or a less violent life. I'll read it in full: \"A frequent explanation\
  \ for the canine reduction in bipedality is that handheld weapons replaced the superior\
  \ canine teeth. If male-to-male agonism had been fundamental to early hominid fitness,\
  \ what selective agency would have reduced its signature characteristic: the bite?\
  \ Additionally, the improbability of the weapons argument is highlighted by the\
  \ absence of sperm competition in gorillas and orangutans, which is accompanied\
  \ by dramatically reduced testis size and the elimination of a free scrotum. Their\
  \ testes are more judiciously contained in a post-penile bulge. In contrast, human\
  \ scrotums are more pendulous than those of chimpanzees, and bipedality makes them\
  \ extraordinarily vulnerable during upright combat. It seems illogical to attribute\
  \ habitual uprightness to weapons, which would demand even greater selection for\
  \ testis sequestration than is present in other primates.\" \n\nSo the argument\
  \ here is that the fact that we are bipeds with pendulous testes\u2014though not\
  \ all of us, but some of us\u2014supports the idea that, at this point in our evolution,\
  \ the main determinant of our survival was not our ability to kill other bipeds\
  \ and tear their parts apart. So, I find this to be the most hopeful aspect for\
  \ humankind: our secondary pendula and wimpy little teeth. Moving on, Arth, you\
  \ just missed a great part. Ramidus comes along, early biped walking around, still\
  \ not quite a proper biped, but Lucy shows up, and Lucy is a proper biped. Where's\
  \ that part? I missed that part. So, here's the picture. These are the homos and\
  \ the Pan paniscus, which are the chimps and the bonobos. This is where Arpus hangs\
  \ out, I guess not with the gorillas. I guess Arty was not a gorilla fan. I'm going\
  \ to talk about the Laetoli footprints before the rest of it. Actually, no, I'm\
  \ not going to do that. So, these are the three lower bodies, the bony parts of\
  \ the lower bodies. This one is, roughly speaking, modern humans. This one here\
  \ is the Australopithecus afarensis, that's your Lucy. Then this is your chimpanzee,\
  \ your Pan troglodytes. The thing to notice here is that there are a lot of differences.\
  \ The main one to notice first is the pelvis. A good friend, C. Lovejoy, said\u2014\
  another one of my favorite lines\u2014that the human pelvis is the most phylogenetically\
  \ distinct osteological structure in the animal kingdom. Biogenetically distinct,\
  \ meaning it is evolutionarily weird, an osteological structure, a bony chunk in\
  \ the animal kingdom, because there's really not another analog for a creature that\
  \ has a pelvis that looks like this. The main thing to note is that it's small,\
  \ it's squat, and it has these big swoopy wing structures. These are your anterior\
  \ iliac spines. This is different from most pelvises in the sort of mammal kingdom,\
  \ at least, where the iliac bones are more flat along the back. Not that, and the\
  \ effects of this... So this looks like a gorilla or chimp leg with\u2026 This is\
  \ a human leg with muscles, and one of the main features is that the hip parts provide\
  \ powerful musculature for the back. It sort of squeezes the spine in, which results\
  \ in a very stiff but extremely strong back. However, you cannot stand all the way\
  \ up. The nature of the musculature explains why, if you look at videos of chimps\
  \ and gorillas walking, they tend to walk with their knees bent. They can position\
  \ their center of mass over their base of support, which is essential for standing\
  \ and walking, but they do this in a way that can be tiring. They can't maintain\
  \ this position for very long because their legs are bent, so they have to use their\
  \ muscles to stay upright. In contrast, our iliac bones are wide open on the top,\
  \ giving us a swoopy, lordotic spine. This backward bend of the spine is healthy;\
  \ lordosis is necessary, and you don't want a flat back. Our spine bends three times:\
  \ once at the neck, around the thorax, and again around the lumbar region. Our little\
  \ vestigial tailbones also contribute to this structure. Since we don\u2019t have\
  \ those iliac bones running up our backs, we have them positioned on the sides,\
  \ allowing for a very flexible spine. This flexibility enables us to stand upright\
  \ over our base of support, with everything aligned. While I'm using some muscles\
  \ now, it\u2019s mostly to keep my limbs from flopping out. Right now, I'm standing\
  \ on my bones. The flexibility of our spine, which is enhanced by the pelvis, contributes\
  \ to our bipedalism. Additionally, the swoopy nature of the pelvis provides excellent\
  \ attachment points for movements such as abduction, which takes limbs away from\
  \ the body, and adduction, which brings them toward it. These terms may sound silly,\
  \ but the ability to perform these movements is invaluable for controlling our bodies\
  \ when standing on one stumpy limb. the foot, we have a much stronger and more stable\
  \ structure. This allows us to support our body weight effectively while standing\
  \ and walking. Our feet are designed for stability rather than grasping, which is\
  \ a trade-off we made during our evolution to bipedalism. With the direction of\
  \ locomotion, we get incredibly fine force control. Our ability to control the forces\
  \ under our feet is very refined; we are specialized at being able to manage these\
  \ forces effectively. This specialization has been so helpful to us that we gave\
  \ up the ability to grasp by aligning the thumb with the long axis of the foot.\
  \ Now, as we walk through the world and typically hit the ground with our heel,\
  \ the center of pressure moves from the back of your foot to the front. You can\
  \ control that force and the center of pressure with significant power and precision\u2014\
  very finely\u2014through the corticospinal tracts and various neural mechanisms.\
  \ We can manipulate the physics of the center of pressure and center of mass that\
  \ we have been discussing all semester because we have sacrificed our foot-grasping\
  \ thumbs for this powerful hallucination right there. Okay, shoe's back on. How\
  \ are we doing? We're doing okay. I knew this was going to take pretty much the\
  \ entire time. Yes. Now, in the spirit of this, we are talking about six to seven\
  \ million years ago with our ancestors. I also recently hurt my back, which is a\
  \ common issue that happens with a flexible spine. So here I am, thinking, \"Oh\
  \ look, we have flexible spines.\" However, chimps do not throw out their upper\
  \ back or spines because their lats connect directly to their pelvis, which gives\
  \ them a relative strength advantage over us. Their muscle attachments allow for\
  \ this, but they lose precision. This is true on a neural level to some extent,\
  \ but also at the musculoskeletal level; the structure of their bodies emphasizes\
  \ power rather than precision. Lucy had all the same features we do: feet, pelvis,\
  \ spine, knees, and a carrying angle in our arms so they can move without hitting\
  \ our pelvis. She shares that with chimps, and that leads us to what is shown in\
  \ this picture. This is one of my favorite archaeological finds in history\u2014\
  these are the Laetoli footprints. They were also found near the old Divi Gorge in\
  \ Tanzania, and they represent a region of footprints from about 4 million years\
  \ ago. There are roughly 70 footprints in that region. It was basically an area\
  \ where some event occurred\u2014possibly a volcanic event or a rain event. There\
  \ was this layer of what they call chaff, which consisted of strange wet mud. During\
  \ a particular state of that mud, I think they said three hominids walked across\
  \ it: two big ones and one small one. If you believe the poetic stories, it was\
  \ a family. However, if you're less inclined to that interpretation, we really don\u2019\
  t have a good way to know. So, there were two big ones and one small one, and at\
  \ one point during the walk, the small one began walking in the footprints of the\
  \ big one. 4 million years ago, they conducted a lot of analyses of the squish patterns\
  \ found in the mud where the footprints were made. Afterward, something else happened\
  \ which caused this layer to be covered and the footprints to fossilize. Later on,\
  \ a European colonizer discovered them and wrote them down. They took scans, casts,\
  \ and all sorts of materials, then reburied them to avoid removing them from the\
  \ ground. They marked the site, took a bunch of measurements and casts, and then\
  \ covered the footprints again because they didn't want to create a tourist attraction\
  \ that could ruin the site. So, these footprints are still located somewhere near\
  \ Old Divi Gorge in Tanzania. When looking at the footprint of a chimp, you can\
  \ see the opposable foot. The footprints found at the Laetoli site show someone\
  \ using heel-to-toe walking, rather than the way chimpanzees walk. Their center\
  \ of pressure moved along the long axis of their foot, controlled by this powerful\
  \ mechanism. So, 4 million years ago, three individuals walked across a muddy field,\
  \ and now we can see them and contemplate why there were two big ones and one small\
  \ one. There were big ones and one small one, and why did the small one walk in\
  \ the footprints of the big one? It seems like something I might do if I were in\
  \ a muddy field with someone else. If you've ever walked through snow, that's how\
  \ we do it. This guy wasn't us; they were not Arty. She was a different cousin friend.\
  \ She was a chimp; she is no closer to us than a chimpanzee would be. But, you know,\
  \ we are related. So, we hung out, and now we're on our branch of the tree. There's\
  \ no one else on this branch but us. No one else remaining on this branch but us.\n\
  \nThere are a couple extra steps in here: you get Homo erectus, which I think was\
  \ called that because they were also a good biped. But then we discovered Lucy later,\
  \ and she was a better biped. Not Homo, but Australopithecus; the distinctions there\
  \ get murky for me. Then we get Homo habilis. Tulio? Not really; no one called him\
  \ that, but I think it's funny. Homo habilis people like to say is the origin of\
  \ tool use, but we don't really know, obviously.\n\nThe actual first tool user in\
  \ our lineage is somewhere in this range, and we know that largely by just what\
  \ they left behind. Mostly, that comes in the form of stone tools. If you think\
  \ about it, if you're out in the woods, what's the first thing you pick up? It's\
  \ not necessarily a rock; it's like a stick. If you're out and you're hunting animals,\
  \ you might wear their fur; you might do stuff like that. None of that is going\
  \ to leave a fossil in the same way that a good rock will. So, a lot of the early\
  \ evidence that we have for tool use comes in the form of stone tools.\n\nThere\
  \ was a really great talk that I saw once from someone whose name I don't remember.\
  \ I couldn't find it after looking because we have a ton of evidence of these stone\
  \ tools. These are literal rocks; we don't have to wait for some fancy special fossilization\
  \ event: it's just a rock. You can start looking for rocks that are basically like\
  \ stone tools in places that you wouldn't expect, old stone tools. Actually, I think\
  \ the author of this paper might be the guy I'm thinking about because I think this\
  \ is what this is about. The origin of these tools and the evolution of these tools\
  \ fit a particular kind. There was also an evolution that happened there. The first\
  \ stone tools were just kind of... Good rock tools were often discovered in places\
  \ where they should not have been found, and they displayed wear patterns that one\
  \ would not expect from natural processes. It seems like someone thought, \"I like\
  \ this rock; I'm going to carry it with me.\" Did they have a bag to put it in?\
  \ Probably not, at least not initially. Eventually, they likely did have bags, but\
  \ those bags did not last while the rocks did. This was during the hand axe era\
  \ of human tool use, which encompasses most of our evolutionary history. \n\nPeople\
  \ also found these flakes; they identified particular rocks that shattered well.\
  \ After hunting and killing something, they would find these rocks, smash them on\
  \ the ground, and pick up the sharp parts to use for carving. They weren't shaping\
  \ the rocks necessarily; they were smashing them and then selecting the best pieces.\
  \ As we examine the history, we can see that tools became increasingly sophisticated\
  \ over millions of years, starting from simply recognizing a good rock to identifying\
  \ useful rock flakes found near hunting sites. From there, tools became more advanced,\
  \ requiring heightened cognitive abilities.\n\nIn the later stages of tool development,\
  \ used in some areas even today, the stone tools became very complex. To create\
  \ these sophisticated tools, one could not simply smash a rock and hope it turned\
  \ out sharp. Instead, the rock had to be shaped in a particular way. Once it was\
  \ ready, a single decisive strike would shear off a perfectly shaped blade. The\
  \ paper, if this is the one, discusses how the researcher learned this technique,\
  \ realizing that once a certain level of skill was achieved, the process shifted\
  \ from mere stimulus-response actions to planning ahead. It became a meticulous\
  \ sequence of actions leading to the final strike that produced the desired tool.\
  \ \n\nThis narrative of the evolution of cognitive capacity is illustrated through\
  \ the increasing complexity of stone tools found over time. It\u2019s also worth\
  \ noting that if one was making tools, they were likely engaged in various other\
  \ activities as well\u2014using interesting sticks, finding unique rocks, and wearing\
  \ furs. I cannot imagine being able to do some of these things without considering\
  \ the broader context of their lives. This is without also noticing that I just\
  \ killed that tiger, and it's got a lot of fur, and I'm cold. I think I'm going\
  \ to figure out how to do that. At this point, they're still not proper humans,\
  \ but they're smart, so they're probably doing stuff. If they were painting themselves,\
  \ if they were doing something resembling art, we find cave art and similar things.\
  \ Our ability to know that is lost because those things don't leave evidence. Then\
  \ you get a cacophony of homos, which is not the proper term, but that's the type.\
  \ You have all of these homos: Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis, Homo erectus, and\
  \ Homo naledi\u2014that's the one we found in that cave. Homo floresiensis is another\
  \ one; I think that's the one they call 'The Hobbit,' a little guy. There's also\
  \ Homo neanderthalensis and then Homo sapiens\u2014that's us. Some of these seem\
  \ to indicate that there was some mix going on. There were a bunch of them; it was\
  \ a pretty good body type, and it was very effective. There were many homos running\
  \ around the Eurasian continent for a long time, and then they all just died out,\
  \ except for us. There were certainly some extinction events; there were some narrow\
  \ bottlenecks at points where they say it got down to, like, 25,000 or so breeding\
  \ pairs. For some reason we don't really know, we're the only ones left. A lot of\
  \ them died off; we might have killed some of them, and we probably interbred with\
  \ Neanderthals. We all have some percentage of Neanderthal DNA. If you're thinking,\
  \ 'I thought different species couldn't breed together,' it's that speciation is\
  \ complicated and murky, so we don't really know. But we do know that it's just\
  \ us left. The bipedal, hand-wielding species condensed down to this. The questions\
  \ of why Homo sapiens won out\u2014why there's Homo sapiens and not Homo neanderthalensis\u2014\
  are interesting. We lived at the same time as they did. They were bigger than us\
  \ and had bigger brains, not necessarily a bigger brain-to-body ratio, but definitely\
  \ bigger brains. It's thought that since we were smaller, we survived the ice ages\
  \ better, or we just kind of overlapped and interbred, and there were just more\
  \ of us. So, we stopped finding distinct ones of these. and start finding mixed\
  \ ones. Who knows? And then that's the question mark. Who knows how we got there?\
  \ So here we are now, we're these bubble-headed, soft-toothed, kind-hearted jog\
  \ monsters. One of the things is there's a lot of evidence around the early Homo\
  \ sapiens that we started becoming nice in some way, shape, or form. We find skeletons\
  \ of humans that had bone disorders that would have made them basically immobile\
  \ their entire lives. If they lived to be the age at which we found them, someone\
  \ took care of them for that entire time. We find burials of skeletons with really\
  \ valuable, well-carved stone tools in the grave with them. Somebody loved this\
  \ person enough to give up a very valuable tool when they walked away from it. There\u2019\
  s also other evidence; one of our many superpowers is that we have a healing factor\
  \ relative to other animals. We heal much better than most creatures, and there\
  \ is evidence from these skeletons that suggests they were often injured. Many of\
  \ these early humans broke their bones frequently. You find evidence of bones that\
  \ broke and then healed, and during that time, that person was useless; they were\
  \ not contributing to the group while healing from such injuries. Someone was taking\
  \ care of them. Even though we were horrifying creatures, we dominated the landscape\
  \ by basically being able to jog indefinitely. This is one of our traits: we show\
  \ up and the deer sprints, and we jog. We learned how to throw, which was a significant\
  \ advantage. It was a big problem for the world because it meant that while you're\
  \ over there, I have this very mobile, powerful, dexterous joint coupled with a\
  \ precisely accurate visual system. All I have to do is get close enough to the\
  \ deer to hit it with a rock, and then it sprints off. I jog after it and get close\
  \ enough to hit it with another rock. It doesn't take long before that deer stops\
  \ being able to sprint away while I keep jogging. It's horrifying\u2014this is called\
  \ persistence hunting if you want to look it up. Is there anything else to say there?\
  \ Yes, also want to mention that the skull is an important part. The skull is significant\
  \ right on the top there, and the thing that was mentioned in... The gorilla skull\
  \ shows that humans are considered to be very weakly sexually dimorphic, meaning\
  \ that the differences in body structure between male and female subtypes are very\
  \ limited. We are super tuned to those differences, so they appear significant to\
  \ us, but on a zoological scale, they're basically the same. Gorillas, on the other\
  \ hand, are not that way. I wanted to clarify that the male gorilla has a larger\
  \ build compared to the female gorilla, which is smaller with a smoother head. \n\
  \nThe key feature I want to point out is the sagittal crest. This structure is present\
  \ in a lot of animals, especially aggressive ones, as it serves as an attachment\
  \ point for the jaw muscles. For gorillas, their pointy heads are related to this.\
  \ You can find sagittal crests in other animals too; for instance, if you have a\
  \ dog, you can feel this on their head. Cats have a less pronounced version, but\
  \ it still serves the same function. \n\nBasically, jaw muscles extend from the\
  \ sagittal crest through the cheekbones and attach at the top of the skull. In contrast,\
  \ our bite is relatively weak because we have given up much of that structural space\
  \ for muscle attachment. If you locate your jaw muscles at the edge of your jaw\
  \ and squeeze your teeth, you can feel where the muscles go up through the cheekbones.\
  \ If you place your hands on your temples and bite again, you\u2019ll feel where\
  \ the muscles attach. \n\nTo illustrate this idea, imagine compressing those jaw\
  \ muscle attachment points to form something similar to a sagittal crest. Now, visualize\
  \ puffing out the area corresponding to the brain, and that\u2019s essentially what\
  \ makes the difference between us and other animals in terms of bite strength. We\
  \ are not skilled at biting compared to them\u2014consider that if you had to choose\
  \ between being bitten by a person or a chimpanzee, you would likely prefer the\
  \ former, as we have sacrificed much of our muscle capacity for jaw strength. That's\
  \ basically what happened for us. We got a lot of extra real estate in the dome\
  \ for our weird, lumpy, dense, complicated brains. By doing so, we gave up a lot\
  \ of that real estate for being able to bite. Going back to the story about the\
  \ pendulous nature of our forbears, that was part of the question. At some point,\
  \ we stopped being good at being raw; our ability to kill each other with our bare\
  \ bodies got worse. This raises the question of what happened in that region. Lovejoy\
  \ talks about the weapons hypothesis, which suggests that we didn't need teeth anymore\
  \ because we had weapons. However, that story doesn't really track because of the\
  \ pendulous argument.\n\nWhat we find towards the end of this unusual story is that\
  \ the actual thing we developed, which allowed us to dominate and kill much pointier\
  \ animals, enabling us to be everywhere and to learn about space and stars, was\
  \ our ability to be kind social animals. We worked together with people, took care\
  \ of them when they were ill, and allowed them to walk in our footprints when we\
  \ had to. That's the story of how we got here.\n\nAnd, yeah, that's about it. I\
  \ think that's about the story of human evolution in a nutshell. I've got six minutes\
  \ left. Does anybody have any questions? I know this is typically a lecture that\
  \ doesn't have a Q&A section, and asking people for questions is rare\u2014like,\
  \ no one's ever going to do it. But just pretend I'm an AI. Imagine what you would\
  \ have typed into the chat box and just find your heart and say it. Which part of\
  \ that story sounds suspicious to you?\n\nSo, yeah, about the equation you mentioned\u2014\
  the lever equation. It's complicated, is the answer. The attachment points and the\
  \ leverage you get from that will definitely be a part of it. Just like the nature\
  \ of pulling from here down to there, that's... Going to be stronger than if you're\
  \ pulling around the corner. But there's other stuff too. One of the things I really\
  \ like is this\u2014by the way, how Q&A happens in a scientific context: you just\
  \ wait for someone to ask a question, and it reminds you of something you wanted\
  \ to talk about.  \n\nChimp hands. So, they have a resting state of our hand with\
  \ our fingers straight. Chimps, and a lot of other tree-climbing animals, their\
  \ resting state is different because their tendons are thicker and shorter. When\
  \ they're hanging out, they hang out like this. If you're grasping from that perspective,\
  \ it's going to be stronger because the rubber bands attached to it are thicker.\
  \ They have a very strong grip, but they lose some of that precision.  \n\nThere's\
  \ also some evidence I've heard suggesting something about the distribution\u2014\
  this is now more neuroscience\u2014of motor units in their muscles. We have lots\
  \ and lots of motor units spread throughout our muscles, particularly in our hands.\
  \ When we activate a particular joint, we do so by firing one of those motor units\
  \ in the muscle. Because we have so many, we can create a gradient in our movements.\
  \ We don't fire them all at the same time, which gives us the ability to make small,\
  \ subtle movements.  \n\nMy understanding is that chimps and similar animals might\
  \ have fewer motor units. When they grasp, they always grasp with close to their\
  \ full strength, whereas we have the ability to have more gradient control. There\u2019\
  s the leverage aspect of where the muscle attachments are and the complexity of\
  \ the tendons. There is arguably something going on at the level of the nervous\
  \ system, like cortical spinal tract stuff, where we have the ability to make our\
  \ muscles do more fine-grained movements. This has a trade-off in terms of being\
  \ able to perform full-power movements. If you're always going full bore with every\
  \ movement, you\u2019re also going to develop more hypertrophic muscles over the\
  \ course of your life. So there\u2019s leverage, muscular-tendon structure, neural\
  \ structure, and lifetime considerations. When considering the nature of being a\
  \ creature with this type of physiology, one might ask where the actual strength\
  \ comes from. This often results in an overlapping and complex narrative. Was there\
  \ something else I wanted to address on this? Probably. Yes, okay, thank you for\
  \ the question. I always like to point out that it is literally because they have\
  \ shorter, thicker tendons, which gives them an advantage in this regard. This is\
  \ beneficial since they live that lifestyle. There is a whole interplay between\
  \ the musculoskeletal structure, the neural controls, and the lifetime of experiences.\
  \ It's always everything all at once. And that's the class. So, thank you for attending."

    \ to talk about evolution, which is a big topic with a lot going on. We're kind\
    \ of going to speedrun through a lot of details, and then we're eventually going\
    \ to get to the part that's more directly related to human movement. So, arguably,\
    \ this is about the evolution of human movement. I have no AI updates; I'm working\
    \ on some stuff, but nothing that has actually produced something shareable. So,\
    \ we'll get there. Next week or the week after, we'll figure it out. \n\nYes,\
    \ let's go ahead. I feel like there's more to say at the beginning. Is there anything\
    \ to say? The semester is coming to an end; there are two, three, or four classes\
    \ left. No one knows, maybe three after this. I think it's either three or four.\
    \ Next week, Thanksgiving week, is going to be kind of like a fake week because\
    \ I'll do stuff that will be relevant, but I know how this goes. I'll try to make\
    \ that non-essential, not that any of this is. Maybe next week will be the one\
    \ where I talk about my actual research because, hypothetically, this is not the\
    \ culmination, but once I'm done with this stuff, you will have hypothetically\
    \ sufficient background. I will have sufficient background to discuss my research\
    \ without most of it being completely new. So, we'll see. We'll figure it out.\
    \ Just show up and try not to fall asleep. But if you do, I understand you're\
    \ tired.\n\nOkay, starting from the beginning: Big Bang, boom, universe explodes.\
    \ That's kind of where we start from. The Big Bang is our current culturally preferred\
    \ creation myth. Like all good creation stories, it explains a lot, but it doesn't\
    \ explain everything. The Japanese, at one point in their history, thought that\
    \ Japan was formed by a giant sword stabbed in, and where the droplets fell, that's\
    \ where the islands formed. It doesn't explain a ton, but it does explain why\
    \ the islands are the way that they are. The Genesis vision of the world is that\

  text: "It was dark, and then he made a bubble because the ancient Hebrews thought\
    \ that we were in an infinite ocean. So, he made the firmament for the ground\
    \ and thick stars for the top; that's where we lived. Eventually, people noticed\
    \ that the fixed stars don't move, but there are others that do move. Those are\
    \ probably planets, so they thought, maybe we're in spheres, and the planets are\
    \ the spheres while the outer sphere is made up of the fixed stars. Then Galileo\
    \ invented the telescope and discovered there was something orbiting that one\
    \ too, suggesting that maybe we orbit the Sun. As our telescopes improved, we\
    \ gathered better data and began noticing strange things, like the universe is\
    \ expanding. That's odd; everywhere we look, things are moving away from us. If\
    \ you think about yourself as a dot in a grid on the surface of a balloon, everywhere\
    \ you would look, things would be expanding. Hubble, not the person but the telescope,\
    \ observed this phenomenon. We invented devices called radio telescopes and detected\
    \ something known as background radiation. If you extrapolate all of this, you\
    \ can trace it back to about 12 billion years ago when everything would be in\
    \ the same place. But what comes before that? We don't really know. Moreover,\
    \ within this cosmology, there's no way to discuss that question. The Big Bang\
    \ explains a lot, but it doesn't explain everything. For example, if it were just\
    \ that simple big bang story, we would expect to see things slowing down, but\
    \ they are actually speeding up. If we had a good understanding of where the energy\
    \ is in the universe, we could look at galaxies and predict their speeds, but\
    \ we can't; we are off by about 70%. We refer to this discrepancy as Dark Energy.\
    \ This cosmology is not entirely true, but we believe it is more accurate than\
    \ previous models because it allows us to make better and more precise predictions,\
    \ which is the essence of Carl Popper's philosophy of science. So, the big bang\
    \ explodes, and all the energy and the universe of all time is created in that\
    \ moment. When people talk about the conservation of energy, that's the energy\
    \ they are referencing. The idea is that there was a conglomeration of matter\
    \ and antimatter that obliterated itself, and the resulting energy became everything\
    \ in the universe, mostly in the form of light\u2014which is just part of the\
    \ electromagnetic spectrum. Interestingly, when this event occurred, some matter\
    \ was left over. If you're curious, Emily Noether is a notable physicist from\
    \ an earlier era\u2014a prominent female scientist before it became widely accepted."

  text: "Who looked at symmetry breaking in math and physics? The question of why\
    \ there is anything left over\u2014that\u2019s what she\u2019s talking about.\
    \ But here we are; there was clearly something left that did not obliterate itself,\
    \ and that\u2019s roughly the stuff we\u2019re standing on. So, a big explosion\
    \ occurred 12 billion years ago, and for a good while, everything was too hot\
    \ to do anything useful. As the universe expanded, the gases cooled down, and\
    \ things started to form shapes. Your positrons, electrons, and all your quarks\
    \ and nonsense started showing up. Eventually, it got bigger, that stuff cooled\
    \ down even further, and you got things like protons and electrons. They met up\
    \ and became hydrogen, and this is where we start getting closer to biology\u2014\
    hydrogen, a good start.\n\nSo, those hang out in the form of nebulae, which are\
    \ big cloud-like things made out of matter. Matter has gravity, so if you get\
    \ a big cloud, it\u2019s going to start to condense on itself. The clouds start\
    \ to condense until eventually, they get so smooshed in that they get super hot,\
    \ and the hydrogen fuses into helium. It\u2019s called fusion because it fuses\
    \ together hydrogen into helium. It creates a super energetic explosion, and so\
    \ it fights against the collapsing gravity of the nebula and explodes outwards.\
    \ That sort of equilibrium of explosion and collapsing is what we call stars.\n\
    \nThat is also the origin of our good friend helium, which is not particularly\
    \ useful in biology. You take one hydrogen, one hydrogen, put them together, and\
    \ you get two atomic weight\u2014that's helium. So for a good while, that\u2019\
    s all we have: just a bunch of hydrogen nebulae fusing into stars that are burning\
    \ hydrogen to get helium, and then that goes on for a while until some of the\
    \ stars start to burn out all of their hydrogen and are left with nothing but\
    \ helium. When that process stops, the helium stars collapse because it takes\
    \ more energy to fuse helium than it does to fuel hydrogen. But they collapse\
    \ so hard that they get so hot that they can fuse into beryllium or something\
    \ like that, which is a less energetic process but enough to fight the collapse.\n\
    \nAnd you get new types of stars. That process continues; they burn through their\
    \ subsequent elements, and you get basically all the chemistry that we need for\
    \ regular old biology. The top row on the periodic table\u2014what's it called?\
    \ The periodic table! Yeah, you\u2019ve got your hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium,\
    \ and these are all of our very good friends. Once you get to oxygen, you start\
    \ getting a ton of water."

  text: "Hydrogen plus oxygen equals water. It's one of the most common things in\
    \ the universe. The process of stars burning through their fuel and performing\
    \ fusion becomes less and less efficient all the way up until iron. Once you reach\
    \ iron, trying to perform fusion on iron does not produce the explosive force\
    \ needed to stop the collapse of the star. Consequently, the star collapses completely.\
    \ For some sufficiently large stars, they undergo a fascinating phenomenon where,\
    \ as they collapse, they reach that fusion point for the heavier elements. It\
    \ sort of slams together and then eventually explodes in the form of a supernova.\
    \ While the initial part of this process can take millions of years, the supernova\
    \ phase takes about two weeks. This is where all the heavier elements are produced\
    \ and scattered into the universe.\n\nNow we have a universe filled with elements.\
    \ These elements cool down until they form accretion disks. Some of the materials\
    \ in these disks, such as silicates, form rocky planets. We live on one of those\
    \ rocky planets. The ground we stand on originates from those stars, so whenever\
    \ you hear people say that we are made of stardust, that\u2019s what they mean.\
    \ This is step one in how planets form, and planets are very important for evolution.\
    \ They are, at least in one case, a sufficient condition for life.\n\nSolar systems\
    \ have planets; some of them are large gas giants like Jupiter and Neptune, while\
    \ others are smaller rocky bodies like Earth and Mars. For the majority of Earth's\
    \ existence, it was not habitable at all. It was hot, filled with magma, and lacked\
    \ an atmosphere. Consequently, it was bombarded by solar radiation, which was\
    \ detrimental to any potential life. No complex chemistry could emerge in that\
    \ environment because it was too violent. However, it\u2019s important to recall\
    \ that there is a lot of water in the universe. Hydrogen is the first element,\
    \ and oxygen follows closely behind. There are stellar bodies that expel a trillion\
    \ times the amount of water found on Earth every second for a billion years. If\
    \ you were to explore space, you would find a lot of water."

  text: "The rocks of water ice eventually cause the Earth to clear its orbit as all\
    \ the parts clump up together. This results in fewer meteorite impacts, which\
    \ is beneficial for life. Additionally, a lot of those chunks are ice, leading\
    \ to the formation of oceans. Oceans are incredibly useful for life because they\
    \ contain liquid water, which has a reasonable temperature range. Moreover, they\
    \ are very effective at blocking radiation. We live on the surface of our planet,\
    \ relying on various forms of air, as well as our Earth's magnetic field, which\
    \ does a good job protecting us from solar wind. Another effective solution, if\
    \ you don't have a good atmosphere, is to live underwater. If you're curious,\
    \ most of the water in the solar system is not on Earth; it's found on a combination\
    \ of moons, such as the Jovian moons Enceladus and Europa. These are ice moons\
    \ with a thick sheath of ice, beneath which we've recently discovered geologically\
    \ active regions with warm water oceans. Who knows what might be found in there?\
    \ \n\nAnyway, here we are on Earth. It's hot, which poses challenges due to radiation,\
    \ but we have oceans. Once we start to explore the oceans, we can form various\
    \ substances. This goop is a good precursor to life. I don't know much about this,\
    \ and I'm sure there\u2019s more to say about the specifics of this goop, but\
    \ at some point, it evolves into more complex forms. The advanced version of this\
    \ goop is, roughly speaking, RNA, or ribonucleic acid. While it's not specifically\
    \ mRNA (messenger RNA), RNA is a crucial type of goop because it's self-replicating.\
    \ Self-replication occurs due to the orientation of its components\u2014the hexagons,\
    \ sticks, carbons, and hydrogens that came from the stars, allowing it to make\
    \ copies of itself. \n\nIt's incredible how we acquired this goop; we understand\
    \ it's simply composed of various elements. Many of the nebulae out there literally\
    \ contain ethanol; you could scoop some up, drink it, and get drunk\u2014fancy\
    \ chemistry is not hard to find. When you put these elements together, it forms\
    \ goop, which can eventually lead to the creation of self-replicating molecules.\
    \ Who knows? It might just be a numbers game: you let things hang out long enough\
    \ in an environment that's protected from radiation, meteors, and extreme temperatures,\
    \ and you end up with things like RNA. Who knows?"

  text: "I know that in at least one case it is possible for certain events to occur,\
    \ and that concept is called the anthropic principle. This principle suggests\
    \ that we understand the universe is capable of creating and supporting life because,\
    \ if it weren't, I wouldn't be able to ask this question. So, in at least one\
    \ instance, on at least one planet that resembles our own, it is possible for\
    \ something like RNA to emerge. Once you have RNA, the process of evolution can\
    \ begin, because when you have something that replicates, it will replicate imperfectly.\
    \ This initiates a genetic algorithm, which is an interesting concept you might\
    \ want to Google. Genetic algorithms stem from basic evolution, centering around\
    \ the idea that if you have something self-replicating with variation, some of\
    \ those variations will be better at surviving than others. If the mutations are\
    \ heritable, this process initiates a fascinating cascade of events leading up\
    \ to this moment right now.\n\nSo, now you've got self-replicating mRNAs, and\
    \ eventually, they form into structures we might call cells. I will show an animation\
    \ in a moment, but let\u2019s describe this verbally for now. Cells are essentially\
    \ a shell; you create a membrane, a lipid bilayer, if you are into that sort of\
    \ thing. Now, there is something very interesting in the history of life: an inside\
    \ and an outside. There's part of the cell that is sequestered from the rest of\
    \ the universe and has its own unique conditions inside, separate from the outside,\
    \ which is everything around it. You are also similar to these types of entities.\
    \ Cells remain quite simple for a while; they don't even have organelles and just\
    \ float around.\n\nAt some point in this process, light sensitivity develops.\
    \ This type of sensitivity arises once those entities have an inside and an outside.\
    \ You might say they have a sense; that is what defines an organism. Eventually,\
    \ this organism develops the ability to sense its environment, absorb some environmental\
    \ energy, convert it into an internal state, and then exert force into the world,\
    \ allowing it to change its position relative to everything else. Hemosensation\
    \ is thought to be the first sense, or the ability to detect chemical gradients.\
    \ For example, it allows this organism to sense, \"Hey, there's food in this direction;\
    \ I'm going to go there,\" while also identifying poisonous substances."

  text: "We are going to explore the sensory development in organisms, particularly\
    \ focusing on light sensitivity. It's thought that the origins of light sensitivity\
    \ can be traced back to plankton-like organisms. These creatures might have developed\
    \ mechanisms to move upwards towards the light during the day and downwards in\
    \ the dark. All you need is something in your body that absorbs photons and a\
    \ chemical process that directs movement towards that light source. If you are\
    \ in water, you may not need to move directly towards the light; you could simply\
    \ move upwards. Eventually, organisms developed a sense of directionality. Moving\
    \ forward became a useful adaptation. We started with basic cellular forms\u2014\
    such as bacteria\u2014which represent the majority of life. Many living beings\
    \ consist primarily of these simple cells or exist in symbiotic relationships\
    \ as hydrogen and similar elements. Over time, cells figured out how to engulf\
    \ each other. For instance, one organism consumed another, but rather than dying,\
    \ the consumed organism became an organelle, leading to the development of eukaryotes.\
    \ As biology majors in the room may have differing opinions on this narrative,\
    \ this is a simplified version of what I believe transpired. Eventually, these\
    \ cells began to clump together, leading to the emergence of multicellular life.\
    \ This transition likely started with simple mats and evolved into more complex\
    \ structures like sponges. The distinction between bacterial colonies and multicellular\
    \ life can be quite murky. At a certain point in evolutionary history, organisms\
    \ developed openings, or mouths; there was a clear distinction between what was\
    \ on the inside versus what was on the outside. Initially, this was like a single\
    \ opening through which substances could enter or exit, resembling a simple tube,\
    \ but they were not yet fully tubular organisms. Around this time, it is believed\

    \ be a peculiar, worm-like creature. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s really\
    \ fascinating that when they flew a mission, they discovered plumes coming off\

    \ smelled the mist, and found things like methane, which is a substance that life\

    \ tubes with a bunch of weird stuff around us, and everything is organized around\

    \ of worms comes into play. Good friends, worms. Folks like C. elegans\u2014there\

    \ the study of worms. When you get to a particular worm named C. elegans, I don\u2019\

    \ Nervous systems have neurons, which are cells that spike. I really don\u2019\
    t have time to get into all the details about that right now, but nerves are very\
    \ good and useful things. C. elegans has 302 neurons, which is the smallest complete\
    \ nervous system that we are aware of. They\u2019ve been around for a while, but\

  text: I think maybe before the Cordata, I'm not 100% sure on that, you get the invention
    of something else, which is way less chill, which is predation. Someone figured
    out that if I can just sit around making my own body my whole life, it's very
    hard and very expensive. But if I just eat you, then I can get all the energy
    that you've been growing your whole life, and then I don't have to do that. Somewhere
    in there, you get the development of the predator-prey sort of arms race, and
    that is thought to be a major driver of evolution. Because if all you're doing
    is sitting around sucking weird chemistry out of geothermal vents, there's not
    a lot of pressure to really be the biggest worm on the block. But if the biggest
    worm on the block starts trying to eat you, now you got to start trying to figure
    out how to deal with that situation. That is roughly speaking thought to be what
    we call the Cambrian explosion, which was a time in the Cambrian Period where
    you just start seeing a whole ton of weird life showing up. You start seeing all
    sorts of much more speciated and much more advanced organisms showing up. At some
    point in that process, you get the bony fish. Oh, I did shut this down; that's

    ways that the harms of places like this are hidden from you is that when you're
    on campus, papers just show up. If you're off campus, it's like pay $40 to get
    this paper. So, even when you're on campus, get in the habit of just taking the
    URL or the DOI, going to SI Hub. The specific URL changes, so you can just search
    for it. Oh, not you, MK. Yeah, this guy with the Crow. Punch it in there, punch
    it in there, and there you go. It'll look different because I have this dark mode
    extension that makes everything dark mode. The evolution of gaze-shifting eye
    movements. I love this paper. This is a paper by Mark Land written in 2019; it
    may have been his last paper. He died of COVID, which is sad for a lot of reasons.
    He's arguably my grandadviser. My adviser, Mary Heho, studied with him. He did
    a lot of the original work on eye movements and natural behavior. This paper is
    spectacular, and it basically talks about how everything in nature uses everything
    in nature that has good vision and has a sort of very similar.

  text: The sad and fixate strategy that we have as humans represents a universal
    pairing. This paper examines these movements that may look familiar to you. These
    are IM movements, which correspond to head movements. When you combine head movements
    with eye movements, you get gaze, which has these stable moments out in the world.
    This example shows the author's left eye looking around a room. This is the kind
    of work you get to do if you study these topics. He compares this to other species;
    for example, there is a goldfish making a turn, and we also see head movements
    in rabbits tracking something. Birds are interesting for many reasons, particularly
    because their eyes constitute a significant percentage of the weight of their
    heads. While we stabilize our gaze by moving our large, heavy heads with our thick,
    short, stiff necks, birds stabilize their gaze with their long and flexible necks.
    However, they can't make many eye movements; they still exhibit a similar sacrot
    and fixate style of gaze, with stabilization occurring at the level of their heads.
    You may have seen videos of people moving a chicken around while its head stays
    fixed, which demonstrates this vestibulo-colic reflex (colic referring to the
    head). This is a chameleon, a rock crab, and a stalk-eyed fly. They all engage
    in similar strategies, using the same opsins, which are the basic chemistry and
    chemicals that respond to photons and light. They all operate in roughly the same
    way, responding to light, but they are relatively slow. It takes about ten milliseconds
    for them to respond to light and tens of milliseconds for them to reset. If you
    look at a bright light for a prolonged period, the aftereffect you experience
    is due to the opsins in that area of your retina not yet resetting. Land argues
    that this 'Coten fixate' strategy is a fundamental aspect of an effective visual
    system. He supports this argument by discussing a scientist named Walls, who wrote
    a paper in 1962. I attempted to read this paper, but it's very lengthy and lacks
    illustrations, making it quite challenging. Nevertheless, I trust Mickeland's
    interpretation that Walls argues there is evidence for the origin of eye movements
    dating back to bony fish, which existed around 450 million years ago.

  text: Life, yeah. This is the one I want. Open. Perfect. There we go. So, these
    are those fishy guys. The way you read this is this is Earth birth. The outer
    rings represent time going outward from this space. You start with these bacteria,
    and then these archaea, and then eukaryotic plants show up. Plants are useful;
    we eat those. They're great. They eventually turn the atmosphere into oxygen,
    which causes a climate catastrophe, and things poison themselves because oxygen
    is really intense. But we get over that. There's also a period of time in our
    history called the Carboniferous period, which is the space between the evolution
    of plants and the evolution of fungi. This is basically a period of life on Earth
    where plants, specifically woody plants, are out here making cellulose, which
    is chemically bonded and really hardcore. When they die, there's nothing on the
    planet that knows how to break those cellulose bonds, so all the plants that die
    just hang out on the ground and turn into things like petrified wood. There were
    apparently wildfires that were the size of continents because forests would die
    and just never go anywhere. They also turn into all fossil fuels. All the fossil
    fuels on the planet, these repositories of rarified carbon, hydrocarbons, oil,
    coal, and stuff like that come from that gap period. It's typically things like
    bogs and swamps because the plant matter would die but wouldn't be broken up and
    re-enter the ecosystem; it would just sequester there. So, fossil fuel is super
    useful; you can do a lot of stuff with it, but there are some problems with using
    it too much, too fast. We'll see how that goes. Eventually, fungi show up, and
    they learn how to eat cellulose. So, the Carboniferous period ends, and now trees
    can rot and go back into the carbon cycle. Thanks, Proto-stes. These are your
    weirdos. This is like the weird Cambrian species. If you ever look at old animals,

  text: 'There are weird spirals and spiral-mouthed creatures from the Cambrian explosion
    era. You can see how things spike out. There were ice ages and mass extinction
    events; there have been several mass extinctions. But right around here, we have
    bony fish, which were the first creatures to make eye movements. Presumably, some
    other organisms may have done so as well. However, bones and shells make good
    fossils, while slugs do not, so there were likely creatures with eye stalks and
    similar features. Bony fish have skeletons, spines, and muscles, and those muscles
    are attached to their eyeballs, allowing for eye movements. Around this time,
    bony fish were doing great biologically. Eventually, certain species decided to
    leave the ocean because it became too crowded and predators were constantly eating
    them. So someone crawled out onto land. This creature was thought to be similar
    to a mudskipper; it would go out, lay eggs, and return to the water. This behavior
    helps protect their eggs from being eaten, as the only things on the ground were
    plants, which do not consume other organisms. They simply absorb light and carry
    out photosynthesis, which is super inefficient but effective. Eventually, these
    organisms adapted to life on land, transforming their flippers into hands and
    their back flippers into feet, allowing them to crawl around. They became lizard-like
    creatures, marking the emergence of tetrapods. Tetrapods have a specific shape:
    head, torso, upper arms, lower limbs, and an optional tail, which is essentially
    a spine. These creatures existed for a long time, and then evolved into dinosaurs
    and birds. Birds are essentially the first bipedal creatures; they beat us to
    the punch by around 200 million years and are better at bipedalism than we are.
    I spent a lot of time in graduate school arguing otherwise, but I have come to
    terms with the fact that 200 million years of evolution equips you for effective
    bipedal movement. Birds have very short femurs, long shanks, and a specific toe
    joint structure. They do not have backward knees; instead, their knees are positioned
    higher up.'

    A frequent explanation for the canine reduction in bipedality is that handheld\
    \ weapons replaced the superior canine teeth. If male-to-male agonism had been\
    \ fundamental to early hominid fitness, what selective agency would have reduced\
    \ its signature characteristic: the bite? Additionally, the improbability of the\
    \ weapons argument is highlighted by the absence of sperm competition in gorillas\
    \ and orangutans, which is accompanied by dramatically reduced testis size and\
    \ the elimination of a free scrotum. Their testes are more judiciously contained\
    \ in a post-penile bulge. In contrast, human scrotums are more pendulous than\
    \ those of chimpanzees, and bipedality makes them extraordinarily vulnerable during\
    \ upright combat. It seems illogical to attribute habitual uprightness to weapons,\
    \ which would demand even greater selection for testis sequestration than is present\
    \ in other primates.\" \n\nSo the argument here is that the fact that we are bipeds\
    \ with pendulous testes\u2014though not all of us, but some of us\u2014supports\
    \ the idea that, at this point in our evolution, the main determinant of our survival\

    \ mud, I think they said three hominids walked across it: two big ones and one\
    \ small one. If you believe the poetic stories, it was a family. However, if you're\
    \ less inclined to that interpretation, we really don\u2019t have a good way to\
    \ know. So, there were two big ones and one small one, and at one point during\
    \ the walk, the small one began walking in the footprints of the big one. 4 million\
    \ years ago, they conducted a lot of analyses of the squish patterns found in\
    \ the mud where the footprints were made. Afterward, something else happened which\
    \ caused this layer to be covered and the footprints to fossilize. Later on, a\
    \ European colonizer discovered them and wrote them down. They took scans, casts,\
    \ and all sorts of materials, then reburied them to avoid removing them from the\
    \ ground. They marked the site, took a bunch of measurements and casts, and then\
    \ covered the footprints again because they didn't want to create a tourist attraction\
    \ that could ruin the site. So, these footprints are still located somewhere near\
    \ Old Divi Gorge in Tanzania. When looking at the footprint of a chimp, you can\
    \ see the opposable foot. The footprints found at the Laetoli site show someone\
    \ using heel-to-toe walking, rather than the way chimpanzees walk. Their center\
    \ of pressure moved along the long axis of their foot, controlled by this powerful\
    \ mechanism. So, 4 million years ago, three individuals walked across a muddy\
    \ field, and now we can see them and contemplate why there were two big ones and\
    \ one small one."

    the footprints of the big one? It seems like something I might do if I were in
    a muddy field with someone else. If you''ve ever walked through snow, that''s
    how we do it. This guy wasn''t us; they were not Arty. She was a different cousin
    friend. She was a chimp; she is no closer to us than a chimpanzee would be. But,
    you know, we are related. So, we hung out, and now we''re on our branch of the
    tree. There''s no one else on this branch but us. No one else remaining on this
    branch but us.


    There are a couple extra steps in here: you get Homo erectus, which I think was
    called that because they were also a good biped. But then we discovered Lucy later,
    and she was a better biped. Not Homo, but Australopithecus; the distinctions there
    get murky for me. Then we get Homo habilis. Tulio? Not really; no one called him
    that, but I think it''s funny. Homo habilis people like to say is the origin of
    tool use, but we don''t really know, obviously.


    The actual first tool user in our lineage is somewhere in this range, and we know
    that largely by just what they left behind. Mostly, that comes in the form of
    stone tools. If you think about it, if you''re out in the woods, what''s the first
    thing you pick up? It''s not necessarily a rock; it''s like a stick. If you''re
    out and you''re hunting animals, you might wear their fur; you might do stuff
    like that. None of that is going to leave a fossil in the same way that a good
    rock will. So, a lot of the early evidence that we have for tool use comes in
    the form of stone tools.


    There was a really great talk that I saw once from someone whose name I don''t
    remember. I couldn''t find it after looking because we have a ton of evidence
    of these stone tools. These are literal rocks; we don''t have to wait for some
    fancy special fossilization event: it''s just a rock. You can start looking for
    rocks that are basically like stone tools in places that you wouldn''t expect,
    old stone tools. Actually, I think the author of this paper might be the guy I''m
    thinking about because I think this is what this is about. The origin of these
    tools and the evolution of these tools fit a particular kind. There was also an
    evolution that happened there. The first stone tools were just kind of...'

    \ natural processes. It seems like someone thought, \"I like this rock; I'm going\
    \ to carry it with me.\" Did they have a bag to put it in? Probably not, at least\
    \ not initially. Eventually, they likely did have bags, but those bags did not\
    \ last while the rocks did. This was during the hand axe era of human tool use,\
    \ which encompasses most of our evolutionary history. \n\nPeople also found these\
    \ flakes; they identified particular rocks that shattered well. After hunting\
    \ and killing something, they would find these rocks, smash them on the ground,\
    \ and pick up the sharp parts to use for carving. They weren't shaping the rocks\
    \ necessarily; they were smashing them and then selecting the best pieces. As\
    \ we examine the history, we can see that tools became increasingly sophisticated\
    \ over millions of years, starting from simply recognizing a good rock to identifying\
    \ useful rock flakes found near hunting sites. From there, tools became more advanced,\
    \ requiring heightened cognitive abilities.\n\nIn the later stages of tool development,\
    \ used in some areas even today, the stone tools became very complex. To create\
    \ these sophisticated tools, one could not simply smash a rock and hope it turned\
    \ out sharp. Instead, the rock had to be shaped in a particular way. Once it was\
    \ ready, a single decisive strike would shear off a perfectly shaped blade. The\
    \ paper, if this is the one, discusses how the researcher learned this technique,\
    \ realizing that once a certain level of skill was achieved, the process shifted\
    \ from mere stimulus-response actions to planning ahead. It became a meticulous\
    \ sequence of actions leading to the final strike that produced the desired tool.\
    \ \n\nThis narrative of the evolution of cognitive capacity is illustrated through\
    \ the increasing complexity of stone tools found over time. It\u2019s also worth\
    \ noting that if one was making tools, they were likely engaged in various other\
    \ activities as well\u2014using interesting sticks, finding unique rocks, and\
    \ wearing furs. I cannot imagine being able to do some of these things without\
    \ considering the broader context of their lives."

    \ animals too; for instance, if you have a dog, you can feel this on their head.\
    \ Cats have a less pronounced version, but it still serves the same function.\
    \ \n\nBasically, jaw muscles extend from the sagittal crest through the cheekbones\
    \ and attach at the top of the skull. In contrast, our bite is relatively weak\
    \ because we have given up much of that structural space for muscle attachment.\
    \ If you locate your jaw muscles at the edge of your jaw and squeeze your teeth,\

    \ So, they have a resting state of our hand with our fingers straight. Chimps,\

    \ I've heard suggesting something about the distribution\u2014this is now more\
    \ neuroscience\u2014of motor units in their muscles. We have lots and lots of\
    \ motor units spread throughout our muscles, particularly in our hands. When we\
    \ activate a particular joint, we do so by firing one of those motor units in\
    \ the muscle. Because we have so many, we can create a gradient in our movements.\
    \ We don't fire them all at the same time, which gives us the ability to make\
    \ small, subtle movements.  \n\nMy understanding is that chimps and similar animals\
    \ might have fewer motor units. When they grasp, they always grasp with close\
    \ to their full strength, whereas we have the ability to have more gradient control.\
    \ There\u2019s the leverage aspect of where the muscle attachments are and the\
    \ complexity of the tendons. There is arguably something going on at the level\
    \ of the nervous system, like cortical spinal tract stuff, where we have the ability\

    Yes, okay, thank you for the question. I always like to point out that it is literally
