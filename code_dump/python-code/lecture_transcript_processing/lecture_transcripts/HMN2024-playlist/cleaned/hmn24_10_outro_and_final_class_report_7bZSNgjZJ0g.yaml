full_transcript: "Okay, hello everybody and welcome to the last class of the semester.\
  \ Right? Good. Yeah, it went very fast. So, thanks for showing up and for sticking\
  \ around. There's no final; you're all good. Today, I'm mostly going to be talking\
  \ about some wrap-up stuff. I'll be presenting my final project, which I hope will\
  \ meet your approval. My final project is making sense of the massive amounts of\
  \ text you all put into the machine, and I\u2019m thinking about what that looks\
  \ like. It pulls out a sort of weird report for each of you based on what you have\
  \ been talking about. I don't think I'll take up nearly the entire class, so my\
  \ intention is to situate you to that data and show you some little fun things I\
  \ just added to the machine. For the remainder of the time, I will do a small group\
  \ activity, where you can look over what the bot thinks you're interested in and\
  \ discuss it in your groups. I'll come around and chat with you a bit about what's\
  \ going on there. Then we'll be roughly good. \n\nI'm also going to talk a little\
  \ bit about the research that I do in my life and in my lab, and I'll discuss a\
  \ couple of avenues you can take to involve yourself in future semesters if you're\
  \ interested in this type of thing. So, let's see what order we should do this in.\
  \ First, I want to do a quick tutorial on how to set up your own Skelly bot server,\
  \ because it's very easy to do\u2014just a couple of clicks\u2014and you can have\
  \ your own version of this thing and run it until I shut it down, which probably\
  \ won't be very soon, as I'm going to be continuously working on it. We'll do that\
  \ before the second half of class. If anyone has questions or wants to set that\
  \ up, you can do so. Please don't use it to cheat, but it's no different than any\
  \ other AI tool, so I don't feel like I'm giving you any forbidden weaponry that\
  \ wouldn't already be available. So, yeah, I'll stand by that. Let's start with\
  \ the procedural stuff. If you are curious about this type of research, this general\
  \ domain, and you would like to stay affiliated with the unusual work I do in my\
  \ life, the easiest way to do that is to join the research server I run for my lab.\
  \ You can find people there, including various iterations of my students. It's a\
  \ human research lab, which is basically an acronym for human movement neuroscience.\
  \ The specific tag I use for Northeastern students is \"Numans\"\u2014NE M O N\u2014\
  just because it's funny.\n\nTo invite people, I need to generate a link. I will\
  \ do that now. Here\u2019s the link: \n[insert link]. You can go to our server,\
  \ find the announcements, and click on the link to join my research lab server.\
  \ Once you click it, you\u2019ll pop up in the server. It's used in a functional\
  \ way, so the conversations might feel a bit like you are jumping in the middle\
  \ of discussions.\n\nI'll make announcements there regarding general events on campus,\
  \ including an open lab meeting type of thing that I conduct. I will put the schedule\
  \ there as well. Generally, the on-campus lab I run has an open invite policy and\
  \ a flexible schedule. If you see a time when it's going on and can only show up\
  \ for a part of that time, that's perfectly fine\u2014just show up without needing\
  \ to ask. Even if you show up in a year and a half, I may not be here, but if you\
  \ come back in six months, just show up; it will be good.\n\nAlso, regarding the\
  \ voice channel, if anyone here is in it accidentally, you can exit by clicking\
  \ on the leave button, which you will find easily.\n\nFor those interested specifically\
  \ in the free MOAP side of things, the free MOAP refers to the MOAP mapping project\
  \ we initiated at the beginning. This server is related to that and is more public-facing.\
  \ Last I checked, there were about 2,500 individuals hanging out there, and at this\
  \ point, I think it\u2019s a pretty even mix of people participating. Students and\
  \ researchers in neuroscience, robotics, and clinical work, as well as an equal\
  \ mix of animators and game designers, mostly on the indie side of things, are involved.\
  \ If you're curious about this, you can join the free MOAP project public server\
  \ by clicking here. This public-facing space has a different vibe, so feel free\
  \ to get involved and see what's happening there. \n\nThinking about next semester,\
  \ I am not completely sure what the schedule will look like over winter break; it's\
  \ always a bit unpredictable. However, in the spring semester, I will have a lab\
  \ meeting type of event once a week on campus. It will mostly be Aaron and me meeting\
  \ up and focusing on the research side of things, primarily in Richard's 453. I\
  \ will post the schedule sometime during the winter break, but it depends on what\
  \ my class schedule ends up being, which I haven't checked yet. I think it will\
  \ likely be on Tuesday or Thursday afternoons, so please keep an eye out for updates.\n\
  \nJust a reminder about the basic rules: the white dots on the channels indicate\
  \ that a message has been posted, and a red number means that you've been specifically\
  \ tagged. If you see a red dot appearing from the lab server, it's likely because\
  \ I've tagged the Numan role, indicating that there is open conversation or announcements\
  \ for all student-affiliated participants. \n\nIn addition, I will make an announcement\
  \ about what I will be doing in my class next semester. It's going to be an inquiry\
  \ session, similar to the first semester for freshmen, which you all presumably\
  \ experienced at some level. This will be essentially the same course but split\
  \ into twice a week sessions. I will cover mostly the same topics in a shorter format.\
  \ The sessions will be divided: one will focus on lecture-type material, while the\
  \ other will be more research-oriented, providing time for actual data analysis\
  \ and other related activities. I think the way that you usually conduct inquiries\
  \ is that you are supposed to present a paper at the end of the semester. However,\
  \ I do it more like a mini research project. If anyone is interested and the timing\
  \ works out, this will also be an open invitation for upperclassmen who want to\
  \ attend and have an opportunity to dig a little deeper into the material. They\
  \ can participate in a more structured research project to help some freshmen understand\
  \ what papers are. You have seen how this works; there is a lot of surface area,\
  \ and there aren\u2019t many people with the specific areas of knowledge that I\
  \ am teaching, except for me, since I am the one standing here. In terms of the\
  \ research aspect, if you wanted to show up, you would have the ability to mix and\
  \ match and help out others who are doing projects, maybe steer some people in directions\
  \ that you care about. Then they will present at the end of the semester. Anyone\
  \ you helped will have your name on the poster, and I include a section for undergraduate\
  \ research involvement, which is a nice way to enhance your resume with legitimate\
  \ lines stating that you assisted with research projects. I don\u2019t know if anyone\
  \ feels like attending an additional class for which you will receive no credit,\
  \ but you might enjoy the experience. I will also make an announcement once I know\
  \ more about what that schedule will be. Additionally, you are free to come and\
  \ go throughout the semester, which is true, but the way the class goes may not\
  \ always go as I anticipate. I will provide an announcement before the semester\
  \ begins about what I think the vibe will be, and if it shifts, just ask about it\
  \ or show up anyway\u2014it doesn't matter. On a similar note, I know that for a\
  \ lot of your degrees, you need a research lab. You can also complete independent\
  \ studies, but you would need to talk to your advisor about the specific rules.\
  \ I am open to a lot of that type of work, though I probably don\u2019t have much\
  \ available time for truly independent studies. However, if you wanted to do something\
  \ like that, I am open to discussing it further. In order to cover a research credit,\
  \ I would be happy to work something out that overlaps with the work I'm doing in\
  \ the inquiries class. We can find a way for you to choose a project and interact\
  \ that way. I have heard that finding space in those research classes can be difficult,\
  \ and often the domain of inquiry may not align with your specific interests, particularly\
  \ for those focused on data science. \n\nAdditionally, I want to note again that\
  \ there is a link in the resources channel to a playlist of YouTube recordings.\
  \ These recordings are of the lectures, except for one where I encountered a problem\
  \ and the video was corrupted. However, they are available online and will likely\
  \ remain online until either Google ceases to exist or the sun burns out\u2014whichever\
  \ comes first. It's more probable that Google would go first, but we will see. You\
  \ can check in on all the content I've mentioned; the lecture from last time is\
  \ available for the majority of you who weren't here.\n\nAt some point, hopefully\
  \ before the end of the semester or before the winter break, Skybot will have the\
  \ capability to process YouTube URLs. You will be able to provide a URL, and it\
  \ will pull a transcript and generate a summary. This will allow you to review what\
  \ we've been discussing. One of the interesting aspects of teaching this class with\
  \ a tech tool that I've developed is that each class builds on the functionalities\
  \ of the previous one.\n\nIn this semester, I did not add new functionalities to\
  \ the bot, but I worked on enhancing the backend in terms of analyzing and processing\
  \ data and producing reports that we will discuss. For the next semester, I want\
  \ to add the ability for the bot to pull information into a chat. For example, if\
  \ you have a PDF, a DOI, a YouTube video, a website, or a research paper, the bot\
  \ will be able to integrate those resources. You could ask about any of those resources\
  \ in the chat, and the bot would be able to provide relevant information. That will\
  \ be exciting! I'm sure there are questions about this, and the second half of this\
  \ session will be focused on that. I hope so. Roughly, it sort of depends. A lot\
  \ of this, I like that both of those tasks are pretty similar at a certain level.\
  \ It's like adding to the context, and particularly for large things, there's a\
  \ vector search type of thing that wants to happen. Otherwise, if you pull in a\
  \ 300-page document, that's so much text that it'll kind of overwhelm the conversation.\
  \ So, there are things you need to do to make that more efficient. At a certain\
  \ level, the difference between pulling a transcript from a YouTube video and chopping\
  \ up a PDF is not that significant relative to the core task of adding that functionality\
  \ to the bot itself. So, it sort of depends. I have other things to do, and the\
  \ ability to judge the scale of a task is an impossible forever task. I hope to\
  \ add stuff like that before next semester, but time will tell.\n\nFor the moment,\
  \ the bot has mostly been just something that I make and play with. Some people\
  \ and other professors have used it, but it hasn't really been a public-facing project\
  \ like Free Moap is. I'm going to start doing that for this project, probably starting\
  \ next semester. I want it to be a kind of slow roll, so that will change the vibe\
  \ a lot. It will hopefully become something of a proper open-source project as opposed\
  \ to just a toy that I'm hanging onto and playing with.\n\nIn general, I think there\
  \ are some very interesting teaching methods emerging. You know, the stuff we're\
  \ going to talk about shortly, about this fascinating process where I can give incredibly\
  \ dense lectures and then walk around, allowing you all to focus on whichever part\
  \ piques your interest. You get to explore that to some extent. I think there's\
  \ something interesting there that I'm curious about continuing to push and explore,\
  \ and then making that available to other educational individuals, whether they\
  \ are teachers or just people who like to learn things. Incidentally, I\u2019m kind\
  \ of talking backward here, but I often do. Part of the reason why I want to focus\
  \ on pulling external context into conversations is related to this realization\
  \ I had when I was wrapping up the kind of oroboros nature. of AI text where there\
  \ were a lot of conversations. I know from experience that they were all mostly\
  \ on point, mostly accurate, and mostly saying the right things. However, no one\
  \ is checking the work here. I hope you all were sort of looking into this on your\
  \ own, but I wasn't. I was thinking about the order of or distances from a human\
  \ and distances from empirical measurement\u2014this chain of reasoning we've talked\
  \ about in a lot of research settings. In these settings, the human asks a question,\
  \ and the bot produces an answer. You have a conversation with these human-bot couplets,\
  \ and then you summarize that. You say, \"Okay, here's the summary of that conversation,\"\
  \ and then you summarize the summaries. At that point, you have a report on the\
  \ topic. But at some point, the AI text begins analyzing the AI text, which progresses\
  \ farther and farther from the real natural world. Therefore, I think it's not too\
  \ insane to imagine a setting where the bot can look at the questions, pull some\
  \ review articles from PubMed, and instead of just stating what it thinks it should\
  \ say based on its training, it can provide a response informed by its training\
  \ plus articles pulled from humans who presumably have qualifications and peer review\
  \ and empirical measurements behind them at some level. With that in mind, let's\
  \ talk about where we got with this thing. As before, in the resources channel,\
  \ there are server scrape checkpoints. The last one here is the last one I intend\
  \ to produce. But before we go into that, I learned how to do this, didn't I? Is\
  \ it forward or backward to pull it out? I can't remember if it was pull it out\
  \ or push it in. So, here's a quick overview of the basic algorithm that happened.\
  \ You, as a human, congratulations, and here\u2019s the bot doing its best. That's\
  \ the international sign for bot, and you ask a question, and the bot... produces\
  \ an answer, whatever, and then we have a couple of those. We're going to call this\
  \ a chat, a thread, or a conversation. This is sort of the basic unit that you've\
  \ been producing this whole time. There are these linked blobs of text representing\
  \ human questions. I know there were different formats; it wasn't always just question\
  \ and answer. It was a lot of question and answer, but you know, human query, bot\
  \ response, human query, bot response. Each of these is a chat. Then we have the\
  \ structural aspect of this: we have the server, which is the Discord server. The\
  \ Discord server has categories, such as the lectures, the bodies, and the eyeballs.\
  \ We didn't really end up using a lot of this structure other than the lectures,\
  \ but that's okay. Each category has a certain set of channels. Channels are named,\
  \ and again, there's a prompting feature that we didn't really use much of, which\
  \ is also okay. Within each of these categories, there are chats, and each chat\
  \ has messages. These are the basic units of the conversation. Let's see, do I have\
  \ the numbers here? This is one of those things where what you're seeing is what\
  \ I got done. I'm sure you are familiar with working under a deadline, and the difference\
  \ between the things you hope you can get done and the things that actually get\
  \ done is often quite dramatic. But like, I should know things like we had this\
  \ many chats and this many words; however, I don't know those numbers off the top\
  \ of my head. They might just be shoved in here somewhere. But the answer is, it\
  \ was a lot. The word count was high, mostly bot talk, in terms of human produced\
  \ text versus bot produced text. The bot talked a lot more, because asking a question\
  \ like \"What is the cortico-spinal tract?\" is not very many words, but the response\
  \ is often quite a lot. I\u2019m just going to see if I can do that. Is that working?\
  \ I don't think it's going to give it to me. Yes, I mean, that's 20,000, no, 200,000\
  \ lines of text, but mostly it's not like functional text, so I don't really have\
  \ those hard numbers there. Okay, so most of the things that we've been showing\
  \ so far, like when I would sort of produce these checkpoints, you load them into\
  \ Obsidian. The analyses that we were looking at were basically iterating through\
  \ each of these chats. For every server, there were three categories: a bunch of\
  \ channels, a bunch of chats. You get these units of chat, and I would basically\
  \ feed them back into GPT-4, which is the same LLM that's driving Skelly Bot, the\
  \ main guy. It would do things like produce a summary, highlights, or whatever.\
  \ Then importantly, it would produce these tags, which were the sort of hashtag\
  \ topics. Up until this point, that's what we had: a bunch of summaries and AI analyses\
  \ of the chats themselves.\n\nI added in this round, so you might consider this\
  \ kind of like a first-order summary because you're going through each conversation.\
  \ We'll call this a zeroth order because it's human to bot each time. This sort\
  \ of chat summary is kind of like a first-order analysis of that. We're looking\
  \ over, lumping up all the conversations, and examining what's going on in there.\
  \ However, there's nothing that we can do at this level that will group across different\
  \ conversations. Each one of these measurements is sort of independent of anything\
  \ else that might be going on in the server.\n\nNow, there are two additional categories:\
  \ one is by user and another is by topic. By user, that's all of you guys. Basically,\
  \ at that point, what I did is I cycled through all of the conversations. I iterated\
  \ through each one of you, so every ID that showed up in the Discord server, and\
  \ then I iterated through all of the available chats. I think there were like 300\
  \ and something of these; I can't remember exactly what the number was. I grouped\
  \ all of the chats that you as an individual person contributed to, and I counted\
  \ any chat where you sent a single message as a chat that you were a part of. I\
  \ pulled this up because it was a place where I could have done a little extra work.\
  \ I ran the exact same summary, so you get a sort of AI-generated summary of all\
  \ the topics and tags related to this person. This is kind of a report about yourself.\
  \ However, I don't fully trust that it's going to do a good job because if you had\
  \ a lot of conversations, that's a lot of text to summarize. You might receive wonky\
  \ results. The main issue is that there's a huge initialization bias. The first\
  \ text it receives is over-represented in the summary. For example, if the first\
  \ conversation you had was about dogs, and then you had several other conversations\
  \ about topics that aren't dogs, the summary will indicate that this person really\
  \ likes dogs simply due to that initial conversation. There are ways to address\
  \ this bias, but they are more sophisticated than what I did, so you get what you\
  \ get.\n\nThe other thing I looked at was by topic. I went through and grabbed each\
  \ of the tags from all the summaries. I believe not just from the chats. I didn't\
  \ examine the tags individually; presumably, there shouldn't be many additional\
  \ tags appearing here because the list of all users is just a reshuffling of the\
  \ server structure. All the chats that are in the server are also represented here.\
  \ There might be duplications since if you participate in the same chat multiple\
  \ times, the same tags would appear.\n\nI found roughly 1,500 unique tags that showed\
  \ up across all conversations in the entire server. Many of these tags were redundant,\
  \ for example, one tag might be \"ACL recovery\" while another is \"ACL repair\"\
  \u2014those should really be combined into one. Rather than producing something\
  \ for every single tag, I only created documents for tags that had a rank of at\
  \ least five, where rank means the number of times they were mentioned. Thus, every\
  \ tag that showed up at least five times was included. Conversations got this special\
  \ treatment, and that one is a little different from this summary. I asked it to\
  \ make a Wikipedia-style article, so I grabbed the topics, let's say biomech, and\
  \ I collected every thread that mentioned that had this tag in it. I grouped all\
  \ of these together and sent it to a prompt that said, \"Create a Wikipedia-style\
  \ article about this.\" The prompt I made was literally going to the Wikipedia style\
  \ guide, copying the whole thing, giving it to the bot, and telling it to create\
  \ a good prompt out of this style guide. It made a pretty good one, and now we have\
  \ that. So, yeah, what we're about to see should look very similar. Everything we\
  \ have been seeing up until this point is going to be under a folder called 'by\
  \ server,' obviously. Then there are going to be two additional ones: one by topic\
  \ and one by user, where user is synonymous with student. That totally makes sense,\
  \ I'm sure everyone is following fully. This is one of those things where a lot\
  \ of that explanation was for me and for anyone curious about what's about to show\
  \ up. As before, I don't know which one that one is from. Let's see, in downloads,\
  \ okay, yeah; this is one of those places where a lot of work happened that is just\
  \ going to be completely invisible from the outside. There was a lot of stuff that\
  \ you're just never going to see because it was about organization and the ability\
  \ to do this amount of information and have it be reasonable and maintain any kind\
  \ of confidence about what's going on. It's mostly an organizational task. You'll\
  \ also never see all the things that were tried and never completed, and the dead\
  \ ends and stuff like that. So, c'est la vie. Okay, so I'll download the thing,\
  \ open the zip, go into Obsidian. It should be straightforward at this point. Open\
  \ the thing; the markdown folder is the one with all the actual documents in it.\
  \ The other ones just have JSON files, and it's white for some reason. Always prefer\
  \ dark mode, and let's see what it looks like. Unlike before, there are actually\
  \ links between the articles now. It shows up as some links here, and if you add\
  \ the tags and look at all those weird entries, we have definitely at this point\
  \ overwhelmed what Obsidian was intended for. There's also one of the things I tried\
  \ that I didn't quite get working, which was building out a better 3D version of\
  \ this so you can rotate it. I never quite got that working, but you can. In Obsidian,\
  \ click the little gear box at the bottom, go to community plugins, turn on community\
  \ plugins, and browse for 3D. I think that none of these are quite what I want them\
  \ to be, but they're better than what I have, which is nothing. I just searched\
  \ for 3D and turned on the top three because they're all not quite what I want in\
  \ slightly different ways. So you can at least look at them, and mostly it's just\
  \ that this is not going to be useful; it's just going to be something like, \"\
  Oh look!\" Those show up. Do that one. So this one is fun, but it doesn't show the\
  \ tags. However, you can start to see how some of these things work. For example,\
  \ neuroscience is attached to everything, and movement is attached to many things,\
  \ while a lot of these other ones just aren't linked properly because they didn't\
  \ generate the tags and links correctly. This one is a little better; it also doesn't\
  \ show tags, but it gets a special place in my heart because it plotted the XYZ\
  \ in the origin there. It does a better job of showing the titles, but it also doesn't\
  \ show the tags. This one shows the tags, but it's also a bit of a horror show.\
  \ Someone got too excited about Bloom, which is that brightness effect, and then\
  \ there are commands here for display control. You can turn the Bloom down but not\
  \ off, so it does show the route to the tags. It's in green, I believe. Yeah, so\
  \ that one\u2014oh, this one's by a user. So again, there's not much more to say\
  \ about this representation of the graph structure other than to kind of just note\
  \ the general vibe of it, which is that these are a bunch of very... interconnected\
  \ topics, and this exploration, even though it's not particularly functionally organized,\
  \ is representative of the shape of your collective curiosity about the topic of\
  \ human movement neuroscience. If you were to click through, which we will in a\
  \ second here, you would see a bunch of different conversations\u2014hundreds of\
  \ different conversations\u2014of each of you asking some kinds of questions about\
  \ some things that you wanted to know more about. Although the topic itself constrains\
  \ the questions to some extent, if I were to teach this class again with a different\
  \ group of people, you would see a lot of overlap in the questions that were asked,\
  \ but it wouldn't be complete overlap. If it was a different room full of people,\
  \ you would have asked different questions, and then the results would have different\
  \ components. There's something really neat about that. I remember at one point\
  \ in the semester, after I gave a very dense run-through of a bunch of different\
  \ parts of your nervous system in the motor hierarchy lecture, I went around to\
  \ talk to people afterward. Every single group that I talked to was asking about\
  \ something different. There was no overlap between the things that you were curious\
  \ about, which was really cool and surprising to me. You kind of expect that, oh,\
  \ they're all going to be interested in this or they're all going to be interested\
  \ in that, but every one of you was interested in something different about that\
  \ lecture. Because of the friendly machine, you were all able to explore that curiosity\
  \ in a way that was constrained by the lecture, constrained by the topic, constrained\
  \ by the reality of the human nervous system, but shaped specifically by the questions\
  \ that you asked and the curiosities that you brought to the table. That's something\
  \ I think is very indicative of a lot of the world and the way that we do scientific\
  \ research. To some extent, there is this very incorrect view of science that it\
  \ is an objective thing and that there\u2019s no human element to it. You hear people\
  \ say things like, 'Oh, if we deleted all the scientific textbooks, in a thousand\
  \ years we\u2019d have the same textbooks.' That's not entirely false; we would\
  \ certainly discover the same things. We would discover that there's a spinal cord\
  \ and that there's a big lumpy pink thing on top. We would discover things like\
  \ Rodman's areas and that the occipital lobe is where the vision stuff happens.\
  \ However, the concepts that evolve and arise from scientific research are shaped\
  \ by the people who do the researching. The terms, terminology, and frameworks that\
  \ we develop are human creations that help us understand the world. A part of it\
  \ is that they're shaped by the world. You can't just make them up; there are rules\
  \ about the things you can say, but it's a very human endeavor. It's something that\
  \ I think is really important to think about. This is not directly related to this,\
  \ but there's a concept in the philosophy of science, which I think is one of the\
  \ more core concepts. It's called the Quinian web of belief, named after W.V.O.\
  \ Quine. The idea is that your knowledge of the world\u2014your knowledge as an\
  \ individual, as a collective, as a culture, as a community, and as a species\u2014\
  is an interconnected web of beliefs. Each part of it overlaps with everything else.\
  \ When you explore new things and learn new knowledge, you have to integrate any\
  \ new piece of information into that web of beliefs. If the new piece of knowledge\
  \ is consistent with that web, then there's no problem; you can add it in and connect\
  \ it with other things, and then you understand the world better. However, if you\
  \ learn a new fact that conflicts with something else in your web, you have to choose\
  \ to either reject the new fact and say, 'This must not be true,' or go in and adjust\
  \ your web by figuring out what parts are in contradiction. You have to consider\
  \ the cost: is it more costly to reject the new fact or to reshuffle your beliefs\
  \ in a way that may have reverberating effects? I think that concept is very core\
  \ to how we do science and how we integrate information. For example, if a particular\
  \ node in the web turned out to be based on a user ID, say 1126223, and that represents\
  \ all the research that that scientist had done, along with the links to what they\
  \ contributed to the web of knowledge, we would need to reassess everything if we\
  \ found out that this person was a fraud who falsified their data. We would have\
  \ to delete this node and determine how much of the surrounding knowledge can stand\
  \ independently versus how much relies on that person's work. I'm mentioning this\
  \ in the context of human falsification of science, which is never great, but it\
  \ also relates to how theories evolve. You know, Thomas Kuhn had insights about\
  \ this as well. The structure of scientific revolutions, things like that, which\
  \ we're not going to talk about because I'm already getting distracted. But I like\
  \ graphs and nodes, and I think it's running a little late. So, this is the markdown\
  \ folder where we have all of our different things organized by server. The top\
  \ level consists of categories, and then the channel, and then there are all of\
  \ the conversations that stemmed from that. It takes a second to load; I should\
  \ close this. So, this is someone who was asking about, oh, this is not a good choice.\
  \ Let's say reflex balance and ear infection. Someone is asking about ear infections\
  \ and how that could affect balance. The answer is, yes, it can for sure. The vestibular\
  \ system gets involved there, and hopefully the bot said something similar\u2014\
  yes, vestibular rehab therapy. There you go. These are the tags that show up, and\
  \ the backlinks don't work, so if you click on them, it won't work. This is that\
  \ whole conversation there. And then, this is the new topic section, which has a\
  \ bunch of these. Each one of these tags, let's look at something; let's look at\
  \ SADs. There you go. This one has a tag link count of nine, meaning there were\
  \ nine chats that earned the SAD tag. There you go. This is the Wikipedia-style\
  \ article that the bot generated, and I think I included, yeah, these are links\
  \ to the chat. Again, the links don't work, but the names are accurate, so you can\
  \ search for the name to find it. This would have been the users that had the tag,\
  \ but that part also didn't work. And then, we can create a new group file. There,\
  \ all the red ones are the by-topic ones. Oh, wait. Then there\u2019s the file for\
  \ users, and all of the, let's see, what color should these be? Magenta. And these\
  \ ones should be blue. So, all the magenta ones are for the users, so you can. Search\
  \ for yourself in here. The ID is your Discord ID, so just right-click your name\
  \ and get the user ID. You can search for it. This is good old 12831DAAD736; just\
  \ take the last six digits and you can search for that. That will be just as useful\
  \ as the whole ID for these purposes. This is a person who hopefully had something\
  \ to say. The order is a little bit weird here; how do I do that? So, this person\
  \ participated in 10 conversations on these various topics. I have a suspicion that\
  \ a lot of these will show up a little more generic than intended because of the\
  \ smear effect that happens when you lump everything together. But this is hypothetically\
  \ a summary of whoever this person is. This is an overview of their interests and\
  \ what they are sort of looking at. As I said, there's the iterative nature of teaching\
  \ a class like this. This is the kind of thing I wish I could have done throughout\
  \ the entire semester, providing this automatically as you go, and developing an\
  \ understanding of what each of you are interested in. I would try to steer, group,\
  \ and lump things together based on this information. Unfortunately, as is often\
  \ the case in open-source software, the vibe is better than it has ever been and\
  \ worse than it will ever be. So, you have gotten the best version of this class\
  \ that has existed up until this point, and with any luck, you've also gotten the\
  \ worst version that will ever exist going forward. Hopefully, it was viable within\
  \ that bound. So, first things first, I think it would be best to find the topics\
  \ you\u2019re interested in and then just find yourself in this thing. Look at what\
  \ it found about you, what it thought you were doing, and what it said your interests\
  \ were versus what you're actually into. We'll come back to that in a second. The\
  \ last thing I wanted to show you is something that is on the scale of being more\
  \ fun and a little bit horrifying, which is image generation. One of the things\
  \ that these AI can do is generate kind of unsettling images. Horrific imagery,\
  \ particularly on the topic of biology, is something I believe you have seen at\
  \ this point. One of the main themes of this class is learning how to use AI, using\
  \ it to explore various topics, and hopefully recognizing AI-generated speech and\
  \ text. AI has a certain characteristic to it, and you can start to learn, and I\
  \ believe you have already begun to internalize, what it feels like to engage with\
  \ something that is not a human being. The general philosophical term related to\
  \ this is the grounding problem, which refers to the slightly abstract nature of\
  \ the conversations. AI is just as likely to produce something totally reasonable\
  \ as it is to generate something completely outrageous because you are conversing\
  \ with a statistical model of numbers. Learning how to recognize those differences\
  \ is a valuable life skill. Similarly, the images generated by AI use almost the\
  \ exact same technology that generates text, just in two dimensions instead of one.\
  \ By this point, you've likely seen AI-generated imagery everywhere. The question\
  \ is, were you aware that you were looking at images created by AI? I'm trying to\
  \ find an example now. Here's a conversation from Caroline that includes 14 messages,\
  \ so I assume you discussed something interesting. Every time you engage in a chat,\
  \ it costs me 4 cents, so be mindful of that. I haven't yet reached the stage of\
  \ running AI locally, but with the command slash image, you can provide a prompt.\
  \ There's a default prompt that requests a picture from the text, and you can set\
  \ context to true, which refers to the environment you are in. If I hit this button,\
  \ it will send something to DALL-E 3. The text is processed, generating a visual\
  \ representation, and shortly, it will produce an image\u2014or it might not. Let's\
  \ see... there we go. A picture based on the conversation has been created. They\
  \ will likely look similar to this. However, this is not a very accurate representation,\
  \ and this is not how brains function. Let's look at a different example. Here\u2019\
  s another 14-message conversation from Sal Matu. I am going to give it a prompt\
  \ and say, \"Focus, add dolphins to the imagery\" just to see if it's working. Then,\
  \ I will use the context as true, and it will do the same thing it did before, but\
  \ now it will presumably have some kind of a dolphin theme to it. Please try that\
  \ with any conversation you've been part of that seems fun. If you want to do that,\
  \ do it in the bot playground. You can also, if you don't use context, just do image\
  \ generation and tell it, \"Show me.\" \n\nIt doesn't really know. I think this\
  \ was a conversation about Parkinson's, so it's a bunch of happy, horrifying older\
  \ ladies with brain hats and dolphins. Look at them go. Look how happy they are!\
  \ Another thing I really hope you can get from this is that these are not brains.\
  \ You should be horrified at the biology of what it thinks a brain looks like.\n\
  \nYou can just say, \"Image prompt, show me the neuromotor hierarchy key,\" and\
  \ I'm not going to give it the context; we'll just see what shows up. It will probably\
  \ be something terrible, but you can play around with that. I will probably put\
  \ some kind of limit on it because the text doesn't really cost any money, but the\
  \ image does because it's a bigger computation\u2014it costs four cents. At some\
  \ point, we'll have it running locally, so it won't cost me any money.\n\nRight\
  \ now, it can't do words, so it produces these horrible things. It's kind of like\
  \ the term \"uncanny\"\u2014it's close, but this person is not doing okay. Things\
  \ are backwards; a lot of the parts that need to exist aren't there, but you can\
  \ kind of recognize where it came from. There's some sympathetic trunk stuff going\
  \ on here; that is the cerebellum, which it wants to represent. That's the medulla\
  \ oblongata; that's the cortex, but the details are off. Neuromotor images are like\
  \ getting in a fight in your dreams\u2014the parts don't really connect. If I were\
  \ a different kind of teacher, I would have assignments that involved labeling all\
  \ the things that are wrong with images like that, but I'm not that type of person,\
  \ so do it on your own. Your own left is an exercise to the reader. The main thing\
  \ I was supposed to do, I actually forgot to do. I will pretend like this is an\
  \ assignment, even though I know it's helpful to pretend these types of things.\
  \ I'm going to make another channel; I'll do it by the end of the day. It will be\
  \ a sort of pairing of the introductions channel that you did when you started,\
  \ like asking you to introduce yourself and talk about this, that, and the other.\
  \ But it'll be more of an outro rather than an intro. I will ask you to... I won't\
  \ do it in class, but I'll do it afterwards. If you can, grab your summary, plop\
  \ it in there, and then have kind of an exit interview with the bot about the things\
  \ you covered and the things you liked. I'll come up with a prompt for that, so\
  \ it'll be a semi-guided conversation. I'll put it on Canvas, and it will look like\
  \ an assignment. Let's pretend like I care about that and just do it for your own\
  \ edification and also mine. Yeah, I think that's about it. I hope you enjoy this\
  \ strange experience. We're not ready to leave quite yet. I think in the remainder\
  \ of this time, let's pull up your stuff, the final scraping, and look at the things\
  \ it was discussing with you. Talk amongst your friends about it. I'll come back\
  \ through and chat until class is over in 35 minutes. So, I suppose this concludes\
  \ the part of the course where I stand up here and talk to you. I hope you have\
  \ enjoyed everything up to and including this portion of the course. Thanks for\
  \ showing up, participating, and being... I don\u2019t know how happily willing\
  \ you were, but at least no one complained too loudly about the strange and wacky\
  \ structure of this course. I hope you got something out of it. I hope you enjoyed\
  \ seeing a little bit about how the sausage is made, as they say. I hope to see\
  \ you all around. Thank you for that. With that, I will turn off the recorder and\
  \ call it a semester. Almost. There's still about 35 minutes left, but no record\
  \ of that will exist, so, bye."

    \ Good. Yeah, it went very fast. So, thanks for showing up and for sticking around.\
    \ There's no final; you're all good. Today, I'm mostly going to be talking about\
    \ some wrap-up stuff. I'll be presenting my final project, which I hope will meet\
    \ your approval. My final project is making sense of the massive amounts of text\
    \ you all put into the machine, and I\u2019m thinking about what that looks like.\
    \ It pulls out a sort of weird report for each of you based on what you have been\
    \ talking about. I don't think I'll take up nearly the entire class, so my intention\
    \ is to situate you to that data and show you some little fun things I just added\
    \ to the machine. For the remainder of the time, I will do a small group activity,\
    \ where you can look over what the bot thinks you're interested in and discuss\
    \ it in your groups. I'll come around and chat with you a bit about what's going\
    \ on there. Then we'll be roughly good. \n\nI'm also going to talk a little bit\
    \ about the research that I do in my life and in my lab, and I'll discuss a couple\
    \ of avenues you can take to involve yourself in future semesters if you're interested\
    \ in this type of thing. So, let's see what order we should do this in. First,\
    \ I want to do a quick tutorial on how to set up your own Skelly bot server, because\
    \ it's very easy to do\u2014just a couple of clicks\u2014and you can have your\
    \ own version of this thing and run it until I shut it down, which probably won't\
    \ be very soon, as I'm going to be continuously working on it. We'll do that before\
    \ the second half of class. If anyone has questions or wants to set that up, you\
    \ can do so. Please don't use it to cheat, but it's no different than any other\
    \ AI tool, so I don't feel like I'm giving you any forbidden weaponry that wouldn't\
    \ already be available. So, yeah, I'll stand by that."

  text: "Let's start with the procedural stuff. If you are curious about this type\
    \ of research, this general domain, and you would like to stay affiliated with\
    \ the unusual work I do in my life, the easiest way to do that is to join the\
    \ research server I run for my lab. You can find people there, including various\
    \ iterations of my students. It's a human research lab, which is basically an\
    \ acronym for human movement neuroscience. The specific tag I use for Northeastern\
    \ students is \"Numans\"\u2014NE M O N\u2014just because it's funny.\n\nTo invite\
    \ people, I need to generate a link. I will do that now. Here\u2019s the link:\
    \ \n[insert link]. You can go to our server, find the announcements, and click\
    \ on the link to join my research lab server. Once you click it, you\u2019ll pop\
    \ up in the server. It's used in a functional way, so the conversations might\
    \ feel a bit like you are jumping in the middle of discussions.\n\nI'll make announcements\
    \ there regarding general events on campus, including an open lab meeting type\
    \ of thing that I conduct. I will put the schedule there as well. Generally, the\
    \ on-campus lab I run has an open invite policy and a flexible schedule. If you\
    \ see a time when it's going on and can only show up for a part of that time,\
    \ that's perfectly fine\u2014just show up without needing to ask. Even if you\
    \ show up in a year and a half, I may not be here, but if you come back in six\
    \ months, just show up; it will be good.\n\nAlso, regarding the voice channel,\
    \ if anyone here is in it accidentally, you can exit by clicking on the leave\
    \ button, which you will find easily.\n\nFor those interested specifically in\
    \ the free MOAP side of things, the free MOAP refers to the MOAP mapping project\
    \ we initiated at the beginning. This server is related to that and is more public-facing.\
    \ Last I checked, there were about 2,500 individuals hanging out there, and at\
    \ this point, I think it\u2019s a pretty even mix of people participating."

    \ well as an equal mix of animators and game designers, mostly on the indie side\
    \ of things, are involved. If you're curious about this, you can join the free\
    \ MOAP project public server by clicking here. This public-facing space has a\
    \ different vibe, so feel free to get involved and see what's happening there.\
    \ \n\nThinking about next semester, I am not completely sure what the schedule\
    \ will look like over winter break; it's always a bit unpredictable. However,\
    \ in the spring semester, I will have a lab meeting type of event once a week\
    \ on campus. It will mostly be Aaron and me meeting up and focusing on the research\
    \ side of things, primarily in Richard's 453. I will post the schedule sometime\
    \ during the winter break, but it depends on what my class schedule ends up being,\
    \ which I haven't checked yet. I think it will likely be on Tuesday or Thursday\
    \ afternoons, so please keep an eye out for updates.\n\nJust a reminder about\
    \ the basic rules: the white dots on the channels indicate that a message has\
    \ been posted, and a red number means that you've been specifically tagged. If\
    \ you see a red dot appearing from the lab server, it's likely because I've tagged\
    \ the Numan role, indicating that there is open conversation or announcements\
    \ for all student-affiliated participants. \n\nIn addition, I will make an announcement\
    \ about what I will be doing in my class next semester. It's going to be an inquiry\
    \ session, similar to the first semester for freshmen, which you all presumably\
    \ experienced at some level. This will be essentially the same course but split\
    \ into twice a week sessions. I will cover mostly the same topics in a shorter\
    \ format. The sessions will be divided: one will focus on lecture-type material,\
    \ while the other will be more research-oriented, providing time for actual data\
    \ analysis and other related activities."

    \ to present a paper at the end of the semester. However, I do it more like a\
    \ mini research project. If anyone is interested and the timing works out, this\
    \ will also be an open invitation for upperclassmen who want to attend and have\
    \ an opportunity to dig a little deeper into the material. They can participate\
    \ in a more structured research project to help some freshmen understand what\
    \ papers are. You have seen how this works; there is a lot of surface area, and\
    \ there aren\u2019t many people with the specific areas of knowledge that I am\
    \ teaching, except for me, since I am the one standing here. In terms of the research\
    \ aspect, if you wanted to show up, you would have the ability to mix and match\
    \ and help out others who are doing projects, maybe steer some people in directions\
    \ that you care about. Then they will present at the end of the semester. Anyone\
    \ you helped will have your name on the poster, and I include a section for undergraduate\
    \ research involvement, which is a nice way to enhance your resume with legitimate\
    \ lines stating that you assisted with research projects. I don\u2019t know if\
    \ anyone feels like attending an additional class for which you will receive no\
    \ credit, but you might enjoy the experience. I will also make an announcement\
    \ once I know more about what that schedule will be. Additionally, you are free\
    \ to come and go throughout the semester, which is true, but the way the class\
    \ goes may not always go as I anticipate. I will provide an announcement before\
    \ the semester begins about what I think the vibe will be, and if it shifts, just\
    \ ask about it or show up anyway\u2014it doesn't matter. On a similar note, I\
    \ know that for a lot of your degrees, you need a research lab. You can also complete\
    \ independent studies, but you would need to talk to your advisor about the specific\
    \ rules. I am open to a lot of that type of work, though I probably don\u2019\
    t have much available time for truly independent studies. However, if you wanted\
    \ to do something like that, I am open to discussing it further."

    \ that overlaps with the work I'm doing in the inquiries class. We can find a\
    \ way for you to choose a project and interact that way. I have heard that finding\
    \ space in those research classes can be difficult, and often the domain of inquiry\
    \ may not align with your specific interests, particularly for those focused on\
    \ data science. \n\nAdditionally, I want to note again that there is a link in\
    \ the resources channel to a playlist of YouTube recordings. These recordings\
    \ are of the lectures, except for one where I encountered a problem and the video\
    \ was corrupted. However, they are available online and will likely remain online\
    \ until either Google ceases to exist or the sun burns out\u2014whichever comes\
    \ first. It's more probable that Google would go first, but we will see. You can\
    \ check in on all the content I've mentioned; the lecture from last time is available\
    \ for the majority of you who weren't here.\n\nAt some point, hopefully before\
    \ the end of the semester or before the winter break, Skybot will have the capability\
    \ to process YouTube URLs. You will be able to provide a URL, and it will pull\
    \ a transcript and generate a summary. This will allow you to review what we've\
    \ been discussing. One of the interesting aspects of teaching this class with\
    \ a tech tool that I've developed is that each class builds on the functionalities\
    \ of the previous one.\n\nIn this semester, I did not add new functionalities\
    \ to the bot, but I worked on enhancing the backend in terms of analyzing and\
    \ processing data and producing reports that we will discuss. For the next semester,\
    \ I want to add the ability for the bot to pull information into a chat. For example,\
    \ if you have a PDF, a DOI, a YouTube video, a website, or a research paper, the\
    \ bot will be able to integrate those resources. You could ask about any of those\
    \ resources in the chat, and the bot would be able to provide relevant information.\
    \ That will be exciting! I'm sure there are questions about this, and the second\
    \ half of this session will be focused on that."

    \ those tasks are pretty similar at a certain level. It's like adding to the context,\
    \ and particularly for large things, there's a vector search type of thing that\
    \ wants to happen. Otherwise, if you pull in a 300-page document, that's so much\
    \ text that it'll kind of overwhelm the conversation. So, there are things you\
    \ need to do to make that more efficient. At a certain level, the difference between\
    \ pulling a transcript from a YouTube video and chopping up a PDF is not that\
    \ significant relative to the core task of adding that functionality to the bot\
    \ itself. So, it sort of depends. I have other things to do, and the ability to\
    \ judge the scale of a task is an impossible forever task. I hope to add stuff\
    \ like that before next semester, but time will tell.\n\nFor the moment, the bot\
    \ has mostly been just something that I make and play with. Some people and other\
    \ professors have used it, but it hasn't really been a public-facing project like\
    \ Free Moap is. I'm going to start doing that for this project, probably starting\
    \ next semester. I want it to be a kind of slow roll, so that will change the\
    \ vibe a lot. It will hopefully become something of a proper open-source project\
    \ as opposed to just a toy that I'm hanging onto and playing with.\n\nIn general,\
    \ I think there are some very interesting teaching methods emerging. You know,\
    \ the stuff we're going to talk about shortly, about this fascinating process\
    \ where I can give incredibly dense lectures and then walk around, allowing you\
    \ all to focus on whichever part piques your interest. You get to explore that\
    \ to some extent. I think there's something interesting there that I'm curious\
    \ about continuing to push and explore, and then making that available to other\
    \ educational individuals, whether they are teachers or just people who like to\
    \ learn things. Incidentally, I\u2019m kind of talking backward here, but I often\
    \ do. Part of the reason why I want to focus on pulling external context into\

    \ of looking into this on your own, but I wasn't. I was thinking about the order\
    \ of or distances from a human and distances from empirical measurement\u2014\
    this chain of reasoning we've talked about in a lot of research settings. In these\

    \ say, \"Okay, here's the summary of that conversation,\" and then you summarize\
    \ the summaries. At that point, you have a report on the topic. But at some point,\
    \ the AI text begins analyzing the AI text, which progresses farther and farther\
    \ from the real natural world. Therefore, I think it's not too insane to imagine\
    \ a setting where the bot can look at the questions, pull some review articles\
    \ from PubMed, and instead of just stating what it thinks it should say based\
    \ on its training, it can provide a response informed by its training plus articles\

    not like functional text, so I don''t really have those hard numbers there. Okay,
    so most of the things that we''ve been showing so far, like when I would sort
    of produce these checkpoints, you load them into Obsidian. The analyses that we
    were looking at were basically iterating through each of these chats. For every
    server, there were three categories: a bunch of channels, a bunch of chats. You
    get these units of chat, and I would basically feed them back into GPT-4, which
    is the same LLM that''s driving Skelly Bot, the main guy. It would do things like
    produce a summary, highlights, or whatever. Then importantly, it would produce
    these tags, which were the sort of hashtag topics. Up until this point, that''s
    what we had: a bunch of summaries and AI analyses of the chats themselves.


    I added in this round, so you might consider this kind of like a first-order summary
    because you''re going through each conversation. We''ll call this a zeroth order
    because it''s human to bot each time. This sort of chat summary is kind of like
    a first-order analysis of that. We''re looking over, lumping up all the conversations,
    and examining what''s going on in there. However, there''s nothing that we can
    do at this level that will group across different conversations. Each one of these
    measurements is sort of independent of anything else that might be going on in
    the server.


    Now, there are two additional categories: one is by user and another is by topic.
    By user, that''s all of you guys. Basically, at that point, what I did is I cycled
    through all of the conversations. I iterated through each one of you, so every
    ID that showed up in the Discord server, and then I iterated through all of the
    available chats. I think there were like 300 and something of these; I can''t
    remember exactly what the number was. I grouped all of the chats that you as an
    individual person contributed to, and I counted any chat where you sent a single
    message as a chat that you were a part of.'

    \ summary of all the topics and tags related to this person. This is kind of a\
    \ report about yourself. However, I don't fully trust that it's going to do a\
    \ good job because if you had a lot of conversations, that's a lot of text to\
    \ summarize. You might receive wonky results. The main issue is that there's a\
    \ huge initialization bias. The first text it receives is over-represented in\
    \ the summary. For example, if the first conversation you had was about dogs,\
    \ and then you had several other conversations about topics that aren't dogs,\
    \ the summary will indicate that this person really likes dogs simply due to that\
    \ initial conversation. There are ways to address this bias, but they are more\
    \ sophisticated than what I did, so you get what you get.\n\nThe other thing I\
    \ looked at was by topic. I went through and grabbed each of the tags from all\
    \ the summaries. I believe not just from the chats. I didn't examine the tags\
    \ individually; presumably, there shouldn't be many additional tags appearing\
    \ here because the list of all users is just a reshuffling of the server structure.\
    \ All the chats that are in the server are also represented here. There might\
    \ be duplications since if you participate in the same chat multiple times, the\
    \ same tags would appear.\n\nI found roughly 1,500 unique tags that showed up\
    \ across all conversations in the entire server. Many of these tags were redundant,\
    \ for example, one tag might be \"ACL recovery\" while another is \"ACL repair\"\
    \u2014those should really be combined into one. Rather than producing something\

    said, "Create a Wikipedia-style article about this." The prompt I made was literally
    going to the Wikipedia style guide, copying the whole thing, giving it to the
    bot, and telling it to create a good prompt out of this style guide. It made a
    pretty good one, and now we have that. So, yeah, what we''re about to see should
    look very similar. Everything we have been seeing up until this point is going
    to be under a folder called ''by server,'' obviously. Then there are going to
    be two additional ones: one by topic and one by user, where user is synonymous
    with student. That totally makes sense, I''m sure everyone is following fully.
    This is one of those things where a lot of that explanation was for me and for
    anyone curious about what''s about to show up. As before, I don''t know which
    one that one is from. Let''s see, in downloads, okay, yeah; this is one of those

    on. It''s mostly an organizational task. You''ll also never see all the things

    \ that. I remember at one point in the semester, after I gave a very dense run-through\
    \ of a bunch of different parts of your nervous system in the motor hierarchy\
    \ lecture, I went around to talk to people afterward. Every single group that\
    \ I talked to was asking about something different. There was no overlap between\

    \ to me. You kind of expect that, oh, they're all going to be interested in this\
    \ or they're all going to be interested in that, but every one of you was interested\
    \ in something different about that lecture. Because of the friendly machine,\
    \ you were all able to explore that curiosity in a way that was constrained by\
    \ the lecture, constrained by the topic, constrained by the reality of the human\
    \ nervous system, but shaped specifically by the questions that you asked and\
    \ the curiosities that you brought to the table. That's something I think is very\
    \ indicative of a lot of the world and the way that we do scientific research.\

    \ a big lumpy pink thing on top. We would discover things like Rodman's areas\
    \ and that the occipital lobe is where the vision stuff happens. However, the\

    \ It's something that I think is really important to think about. This is not\
    \ directly related to this, but there's a concept in the philosophy of science,\
    \ which I think is one of the more core concepts. It's called the Quinian web\
    \ of belief, named after W.V.O. Quine. The idea is that your knowledge of the\
    \ world\u2014your knowledge as an individual, as a collective, as a culture, as\
    \ a community, and as a species\u2014is an interconnected web of beliefs. Each\
    \ part of it overlaps with everything else. When you explore new things and learn\
    \ new knowledge, you have to integrate any new piece of information into that\
    \ web of beliefs. If the new piece of knowledge is consistent with that web, then\
    \ there's no problem; you can add it in and connect it with other things, and\
    \ then you understand the world better. However, if you learn a new fact that\
    \ conflicts with something else in your web, you have to choose to either reject\
    \ the new fact and say, 'This must not be true,' or go in and adjust your web\
    \ by figuring out what parts are in contradiction. You have to consider the cost:\
    \ is it more costly to reject the new fact or to reshuffle your beliefs in a way\
    \ that may have reverberating effects? I think that concept is very core to how\
    \ we do science and how we integrate information. For example, if a particular\
    \ node in the web turned out to be based on a user ID, say 1126223, and that represents\
    \ all the research that that scientist had done, along with the links to what\
    \ they contributed to the web of knowledge, we would need to reassess everything\
    \ if we found out that this person was a fraud who falsified their data. We would\
    \ have to delete this node and determine how much of the surrounding knowledge\
    \ can stand independently versus how much relies on that person's work. I'm mentioning\
    \ this in the context of human falsification of science, which is never great,\
