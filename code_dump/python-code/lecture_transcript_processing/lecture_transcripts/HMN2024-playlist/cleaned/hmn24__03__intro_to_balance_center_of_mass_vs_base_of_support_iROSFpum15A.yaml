full_transcript: "Okay, great. Hello, and welcome to October. If you already had one\
  \ of those, welcome to October 8th. So, today we're going to talk about balance,\
  \ the center of mass, and base of support. After about an hour of discussing these\
  \ topics, we'll do some group activities again. This will be our first technical\
  \ split option. If you are interested in code and programming, you'll have the opportunity\
  \ to focus on that. If you're not interested in that area, you can hang out, and\
  \ we'll do more literature review-type activities. If you've never done it but are\
  \ curious, then you can still participate, as interest and experience are separate\
  \ matters. \n\nThe first thing I want to show before we get into the meat of today's\
  \ discussion is a rolling checkpoint throughout the semester. This involves the\
  \ AI aspect of the class, where I have now an initial example of scraping the server.\
  \ This means pulling all of the chats you've been having with the bot. Effectively,\
  \ I extract the markdown text file attached to the top of each chat, run it through\
  \ the AI to summarize it, and pull out the main points and topics. I do this for\
  \ each chat, each channel, each category, and then for the whole server. The idea\
  \ is to use this to get a sense of what you are all working on and what interests\
  \ you. For now, it\u2019s descriptive; it reflects what you are doing, and you can\
  \ look at it if you want. \n\nIn the second half of class, we will start to steer\
  \ this a bit more. We\u2019ll look at what topics seem to be coming up for many\
  \ of you and gather more details about those subjects. We can analyze and say, 'Oh,\
  \ they are really interested in this topic. Let's discuss it in the next lecture.'\
  \ This process is more of a feedback type of approach. The results will be provided\
  \ as a ZIP file, which you can download to your downloads folder, whatever that\
  \ may be for you. You can unzip that so that it's just a regular folder. Oh, come\
  \ on now. Is it giving you that invalid message? So, it's here. In the server, in\
  \ the resources channel at the top, there's a thread called \"Server Scrape Checkpoints\"\
  \ and there's a zip file. I am totally happy saying that this checkpoint zip file\
  \ is corrupted, and we'll figure that out later. Cool! So, if you can figure it\
  \ out, great. If not, it's basically a bunch of poorly formatted summaries of the\
  \ things we've been talking about, and we just call this foreshadowing.\n\nThere\
  \ are a couple of other things in that resources channel too that I added. One is\
  \ this link up here to a YouTube playlist of these videos, except for the last video's\
  \ video, because I forgot to save it. I forgot to hit save at the end of this, and\
  \ I wasn't saving to a video format that is forgiving of closing the thing mid-recording,\
  \ so that video was lost. RIP lost data; it happens.\n\nAnd then, yeah, that's another\
  \ one of those like maybe we'll get to the point where I can scrape the video, pull\
  \ the transcript, and get the topics out to put that into the notes, but we'll see\
  \ about that. There's also this link to another playlist called \"AI Stuff,\" where\
  \ I talk about things like building Skelly Bot and using it in classroom settings\
  \ like this, so if you're interested in that kind of meta AI ed-tech stuff, watch\
  \ that.\n\nYeah, and then the third thing I added to the server is in this lectures\
  \ category over here. This one down here has a string of numbers which is the date:\
  \ 2024-01-08. That's just a way to write your date concisely; it's called little-endian,\
  \ meaning the little things are at the end of the number. So, big-endian, little-endian\u2014\
  that's what that means if you ever come across it again. Composite people might\
  \ know it; no one else will.\n\nIn that, I put a link to an outline of what I'm\
  \ going to talk about today, which is some tutorial notes. These links don\u2019\
  t work, but maybe you can figure it out. They\u2019re over here. Okay, cool. Well,\
  \ so far I don\u2019t really give you any options. Um, yeah, so Obsidian calls folders.\
  \ Vaults. You want to be opening that folder as a vault. If you feel like playing\
  \ with that stuff, go to any chat and just download the MBB, which stands for markdown.\
  \ It's the thing that turns plain text into formatted text. You just type it out\
  \ in the raw, and then if the .md thing that you're looking at knows how to process\
  \ markdown files, it turns it into that. So, download any chat at the top or download\
  \ this markdown file. I feel it is the seed of the resolution revolution because\
  \ we have just generally internalized this idea that text is like Microsoft or Google,\
  \ when it really isn\u2019t. Text is like a behavior that you do on a keyboard,\
  \ and we want it to look nice, but this is the raw that we actually care about.\
  \ It's also the first sort of entry point to acknowledge that there\u2019s such\
  \ a thing as interpreted text. You type this thing, and the computer knows how to\
  \ make it pretty. Also, Google Aaron Schwartz. If you don\u2019t know who that is,\
  \ he\u2019s one of the people who came up with the original definitions for markdown.\
  \ You should look up who he is and then steal every paper ever published. A lot\
  \ of professors say, \"Be careful; don\u2019t go to HUB or you\u2019ll accidentally\
  \ steal papers.\" I'm telling you explicitly, go to sci-hub, steal papers, steal\
  \ textbooks from LibGen. As a scientist operating under my academic freedom, it\
  \ is the best thing I can do for you to say steal everything from the publishing\
  \ industry. They think it's their intellectual property; it's not. It's ours to\
  \ take back. None of that is relevant though. We\u2019ve been talking a lot about\
  \ the center of mass. I\u2019ve sort of described it at various levels, and today\
  \ I\u2019ve brought a series of props to help present that. Aaron, could you screw\
  \ that together? Thank you. Part of the pattern that\u2019s emerging is that I show\
  \ up late, setting up takes a while, I get frustrated and sweaty. I eventually get\
  \ it working, I give a little update on the technical backend and AI nonsense, I\
  \ have some sort of moral outrage moment, and then I talk a little bit about the\
  \ philosophy of science before we get into the actual topic of discussion. This\
  \ is the philosophy of science part. I\u2019ve talked about the concept of reductionism,\
  \ which is one of those things where it\u2019s such a fundamental aspect of the\
  \ way we live in this society and the way\u2026 Basically, the way that we do science\
  \ in the Western tradition is a heavily reductionist tradition. This means that\
  \ you take a big, complicated thing and chop it up into tiny, tiny pieces. Then\
  \ you look at those pieces in isolated environments and hope that the things you\
  \ learn about those small-scale isolated items will scale up to the larger actual\
  \ desideratum of your study. Generally speaking, it does. That's why we do cell\
  \ biology, genetics, particle physics, and study periodic tables. These are all\
  \ fundamentally reductionist approaches to science. Reductionism may sound like\
  \ an insult, but it's not; it's just a description of a way of looking at things.\
  \ \n\nThe counter to that doesn't really have a defined name, but I generally think\
  \ of it as more of a holism. Instead of taking the thing and chopping it into little\
  \ parts\u2014because the problem that reductionism solves is that science is impossible;\
  \ rule number one: it can't be done. We mere primates do not have access to capital\
  \ T true facts of the world. We can only approximate them with a bunch of sloppy\
  \ empirical measurements and then statistics. The problem of induction and black\
  \ swans are related concepts you might want to dig into. \n\nSince we can't actually\
  \ achieve true knowledge of the real world, we have to cheat and take various side\
  \ steps. The traditional Western reductionist view of science is to chop things\
  \ up into little pieces and hope those pieces fit together into something that resembles\
  \ the whole. A more holistic approach cheats in a different way. Instead of taking\
  \ the whole thing and chopping it into smaller parts to consider in isolation, you\
  \ take the whole complicated thing and try to squish it down into what you think\
  \ is the simplest possible model that captures the dynamics of the whole system.\
  \ \n\nFor example, the concept of center of mass, which I'll show pictures of in\
  \ a moment, fundamentally illustrates this approach. I've mentioned before that\
  \ this is not something you're likely to find in specific textbooks; it\u2019s more\
  \ about ideas I've cobbled together in my research, inspired largely by robotics\
  \ approaches. If you look up passive dynamic walkers, that's a classic case\u2014\
  Andy Ruina, Steve Collins, and others have explored how taking a complex object\
  \ and reducing it down to a single point mass can be very helpful in trying to understand\
  \ its dynamics. What's going on there? I think I forgot to mention that I brought\
  \ a stick. This stick is like the middle part of a floor lamp, and I found it on\
  \ the street. I tried to use it, but it didn't really work right. Then I realized\
  \ that the middle part not only comes apart, allowing me to put it in my backpack\
  \ and bring it to class, but it also pulls up very nicely. It turns out to be actually\
  \ one meter long. I think somewhere at some factory, someone ordered a bunch of\
  \ meter-long poles and cut them up, and now this is a meter stick. \n\nIt is aluminum\
  \ or actually metal and roughly straight. It has some bends, but we can ignore that.\
  \ It also has an even section; this part here is the geometric center of the stick.\
  \ If I place this little thing here, then I can know that this is both the geometric\
  \ center of the stick and the center of mass of the stick. \n\nIf I take this object\
  \ and focus on it, basically, if I take this stick and chop it up into 1 cm sections,\
  \ there would be 100 in a row. I would take the average position of each of those\
  \ points: literally, just take the XYZ of this one, then the XYZ of that one, and\
  \ the XYZ of that one. I would add up all the X's, add up all the Y's, and then\
  \ divide them by the number of chunks. The resulting average position will be here,\
  \ and it turns out that from the point of view of balance physics, that is the point\
  \ you need to support to keep the thing from falling down.\n\nSo, that is true when\
  \ you're supporting it from the bottom. It is also true if you pull the loop through\
  \ itself; that's called a dirt pitch. If you pull it through again, it's called\
  \ a pric, and it tends to stay. I have trusted my life and the lives of many people\
  \ I love to knots in various contexts. A pric can nicely go over that little yellow\
  \ spot and be cranked down so it will stay, in the same way that balancing... The\
  \ center of mass keeps the object in the right position. From above, it's the same\
  \ basic idea. There is more mass on this side than there is on that side, so when\
  \ I move it over a little bit, it bounces back into place. In this case, because\
  \ this is a uniformly massed object, the geometric center and the center of mass\
  \ are the same location. I also found these on the street; there are a lot of fun\
  \ things on the street if you know where to look. These are like old-school ankle\
  \ weights, and you put them on your ankle. This is carpet padding, so it has high\
  \ friction. By changing both the geometry and mass distribution, I\u2019ve altered\
  \ the dynamics. The geometry along the long axis of this object hasn't changed much\
  \ at all; it remains the same length. For any 3D object, there is a long axis, a\
  \ middle axis\u2014sometimes referred to as the intermediate axis\u2014and a short\
  \ axis. Often, they are symmetric, and in this case, the middle and intermediate\
  \ axes are symmetric. You can also Google the intermediate axis theorem, otherwise\
  \ known as the tennis racket theorem, which states that you can spin the object\
  \ around the short axis, the long axis, and the middle axis. It flips midair, which\
  \ is not directly relevant but interesting. There are some cool videos of people\
  \ doing experiments on the space station, though that's not important right now.\
  \ Essentially, I've changed the geometry a little bit, but not in a significant\
  \ dimension; however, I've significantly changed the physics. Now, one side is much\
  \ heavier than the other side. Previously, we were taking the geometric mean by\
  \ averaging the positions of the mass points, which aligned with the center of mass.\
  \ But in this case, that approach doesn't work because all the added points do not\
  \ have the same density. For example, this is filled with sand or something similar.\
  \ I can position the object accordingly, and that should be about right. There we\
  \ go; now this is the center of mass. Although the geometry for our basic approximations\
  \ hasn't changed, the physics has changed considerably, and consequently, the center\
  \ of mass and balance point have also changed. Both when you're supporting it from\
  \ the bottom and when you're supporting it from the top, the basic idea is that\
  \ if I wanted to do another one, I think there are two of them. Here we go, once\
  \ again, even heavier, so I can move it basically all the way over here. It's not\
  \ quite right, but now the center of mass of the whole stick system is very close\
  \ to the big bob at the end. Notice that the first time I moved it, I had to move\
  \ it all the way over here. The second time, I had to move it far less. That's because\
  \ torque is a thing. This is really hard. This is really easy. When we talk about\
  \ the musculoskeletal system, this will come up again. If you're curious about how...\
  \ Notice that my arm also resembles a long stick, and my shoulder, which is the\
  \ main thing lifting it up, is this long and attached right here. So it's much more\
  \ like doing this than doing this. Spoiler alert: Your muscles are unbelievably\
  \ strong relative to the tasks they can perform because they're operating on a massive\
  \ mechanical disadvantage. That's not important right now. So, okay, this is the\
  \ intuitive center of mass. There is a difference between the geometric center of\
  \ a rigid object and the center of mass. The center of mass, which you'll often\
  \ hear referred to as the center of gravity, are the same thing. This is gravity\
  \ being used in the term like density. The center of gravity just feels a little\
  \ more old school to me, or in space, like in all contexts that matter for us, the\
  \ center of mass and center of gravity are the same thing. So if you ever see COG\
  \ in a paper, it's the same thing; it's just using a different term. Yeah, the center\
  \ of... it's like, yeah, basically, the center of density would be another way to\
  \ say that, but that's not quite right. Okay, so this is a stick made of trash I\
  \ found on the street. Excuse me, this is a little wooden fellow, and it also has\
  \ a center of mass, which I could measure if I wanted to. I'm allowed to chop this\
  \ up, but I don't want to. But it is here. If our friend did one of those... Oh\
  \ look, it tips over! So I have to move it sort of more this way, in the abdominal\
  \ area. So as you move the... The mass of your body and the center of mass shift,\
  \ as I said last time. The center of mass is not a part of your body; it is a description\
  \ of your body. If you have one of these types of shapes, the center of mass can\
  \ be outside your body. So, the center of mass is here because it's below that point\
  \ of rotation. It becomes passively stable, which can kind of reject perturbations,\
  \ and we'll talk about this shortly. This would be linked, but it's not. I placed\
  \ it over here. So, this center of mass approximation is, I think, a very important\
  \ and very useful hyper-simplification of the full complex object. It falls under\
  \ the general heading of classical mechanics, which is a part of mechanical engineering\
  \ if you can find the right building to walk into. Specifically, it falls under\
  \ what I believe is called the finite element theorem, which basically says that\
  \ you're allowed to look at the center of mass as a proxy for the dynamics of the\
  \ whole object. So, you take this complicated object, chop it up into finite elements,\
  \ which are small but not zero, and then examining the mean of those points can\
  \ tell you things about the dynamics of the full complex object. I find this concept\
  \ helpful to think about because the setup can be complex and gangly. However, if\
  \ you do throw it, regardless of what you do, it still follows a nicely ballistic\
  \ trajectory. You can also use this to show that even if it\u2019s spinning, it\
  \ will spin around its center of mass and follow a ballistic trajectory. Each of\
  \ these keys is a rigid body, connected by rigid bodies. Therefore, there is no\
  \ stretch or strain or anything like that in the ballistic case; it wouldn't matter.\
  \ But it's worth doing this with people. In this case, I don\u2019t know how much\
  \ this stick weighs. I know that it is one meter long, and I don\u2019t know how\
  \ much these ankle weights weigh, but if we wanted to, we could determine the mass\
  \ of the weights in units of stick mass, using this kind of math, and learn things\
  \ about the forces at play and other relevant factors. Controlling this with muscles,\
  \ that information would be very relevant to us. If you want to do that for a human\
  \ person, basically, I want to be able to calculate the center of mass of a person.\
  \ But how do I get those numbers? Well, it turns out someone chopped up a bunch\
  \ of dead people, weighed them, and we have these anthropometry tables. A really\
  \ common one is Winter, which is from a biomechanics book. I think these tables\
  \ show where they came from. It was like Air Force data; they chopped up cadavers\
  \ and looked at the relative densities, did a bunch of statistical analyses, and\
  \ you get numbers. This is the geometry of it. These numbers here, like .52H, where\
  \ H is the total height of the person, are estimates of the relative proportions\
  \ of different body segments in terms of units of height. Importantly, all the dead\
  \ people they chopped up were men and they were old men because they were deceased.\
  \ There\u2019s often a correlation between age and time. There are newer anthropometry\
  \ tables that look at a broader demographic\u2014different genders, different body\
  \ mass indices\u2014but by and large, a lot of those differences are small. Relative\
  \ to the scales that I tend to look at in my research, they don\u2019t really shift\
  \ the numbers that much, so I just kind of use these because it's a standard and\
  \ it\u2019s around. These names here correspond roughly to the anatomy above, and\
  \ they give you the name of the thing, the definition in terms of anatomical axes.\
  \ For example, the foot is defined as the lateral malleolus to the head of the second\
  \ metatarsal. The malleolus is on the outside; the metatarsal refers to your toe\
  \ knuckle. It gives you the segment weight as a proportion of total body weight.\
  \ For a standard-sized hand, your hand is roughly 6% of your body mass. The forearm\
  \ and upper arm proportions can vary, and your foot is about 14%, which seems high,\
  \ but I don\u2019t know. Your leg is\u2026 Oh sorry, 4%. Yeah, the thigh is 10%,\
  \ and then it gives you the foot and leg, which are added up from the ones above\
  \ it. In the center of mass calculation, I was showing last time with the blender\
  \ demonstration, that little ball moving around was calculated using these numbers.\
  \ We will talk about that in a little bit, but I just wanted to show roughly where\
  \ that information comes from. \n\nI also, some time ago, in a different life, made\
  \ a bunch of GIFs and posted them on Reddit. In fact, this was before Reddit was\
  \ as it is now; it was still a cesspit, but a different kind. Basically, I would\
  \ find videos of people doing interesting things and overlay them with basic center\
  \ of mass analyses. \n\nThis is the hand forearm in a planar view, meaning it's\
  \ a view from straight down one of the x, y, or z axes. So you get to ignore the\
  \ 3D aspect of it and just focus on the 2D. The vertical lines show the extent of\
  \ the base of support, which is where the hand is. The important thing to notice\
  \ is that the center of mass always stays within that boundary because if it didn't,\
  \ it would fall over. \n\nThere are a bunch of these GIFs. This one is wacky. I\
  \ was getting fancier with stabilizing the image, and this athlete is very good\
  \ at this type of movement. Again, the center of mass always stays within that boundary.\
  \ He shifts his hands, and you can see how complicated this is. Yes, he's extraordinary.\
  \ \n\nUsing dynamics, he pops himself up but keeps it within this range. The important\
  \ thing to note is that his hand can only push on the ground. If the center of mass\
  \ ever leaves those boundaries, he cannot pull it back; he can only push it farther\
  \ away. \n\nThis next example is a violation of that rule. This is a balance beam,\
  \ otherwise known as the hardest thing in sports. She does this cool move, but oh\
  \ no, she falls. However, she manages to pull it back in. The most important part\
  \ of that video for me is this moment right here, where she goes out but has a grip\
  \ on the bar, allowing her to pull back in. This is the same basic principle. The\
  \ idea of the wobble in the center of mass is noise in the estimates. All right,\
  \ so those links are all there. There's a bunch of them; click through them. We\
  \ will talk about them at some later date. So, roughly speaking, the important thing\
  \ there is the center of mass. We did talk about the concept of the base of support.\
  \ Your base of support is just the shape on the ground of your support surface.\
  \ My base of support is defined by my feet, while this object's base of support\
  \ is defined by that little point. It is not passively stable.\n\nOkay, so real\
  \ quick, physics: Newton was a guy; he did a thing. Among other things, he came\
  \ up with this sort of theory of mechanics, which is embodied by Newton's three\
  \ laws of motion. These laws are false and wrong theoretical models of reality.\
  \ I think this is a great example of how wrong theories can still be useful. Newton\
  \ had a theory of reality where there was such a thing as position and velocity,\
  \ but it wasn't until far later that a guy named Einstein came along and wrote some\
  \ papers.\n\nI really don't like ascribing these thoughts to specific people because\
  \ they are just the first humans who wrote them down. People say Newton invented\
  \ calculus, but Leibniz also invented calculus at the same time in Germany, using\
  \ better notations. Oftentimes, these are just ideas that are ready to be discovered.\
  \ So, Newton's theory of classical mechanics is false on a scientific theoretical\
  \ basis. If we wanted to actually calculate things like momentum, we would have\
  \ to take into account things like relativity theory and E=mc\xB2 and whatnot. However,\
  \ we tend to move at speeds that are so much slower than the speed of light that\
  \ it would be not only insane to require that level of... Precision is crucial,\
  \ but it's impossible to measure at that level of precision, so we instead use the\
  \ three regular laws of motion. Basically, law one is that inertia exists. Things\
  \ that are moving in a straight line tend to keep moving unless acted upon by an\
  \ outside force. An object in motion tends to stay in motion unless acted upon by\
  \ a force. Law two, which is really our best friend here, is F = ma, or force equals\
  \ mass times acceleration. If you have a mass that is accelerating, that is called\
  \ a force. Mass is measured in kilograms, acceleration is measured in meters per\
  \ second squared. Distance is measured in meters, and time is measured in seconds.\
  \ So, acceleration can be expressed as meters per second squared, and therefore,\
  \ we call that Newtons. Law three states that for every action, there is an equal\
  \ and opposite reaction. So, if you push on something, it pushes back.\n\nI spent\
  \ a lot of my earlier academic life thinking about pendulums. I even brought a children's\
  \ book called \"Seven Tales of the Pendulum.\" It's great; it's about seven cases\
  \ where pendulums have been core to the way we do science for a very long time.\
  \ There are all sorts of fascinating stories in there, such as using clocks to traverse\
  \ the Atlantic Ocean. You had to invent the clock before you could traverse an ocean,\
  \ using changes in the period of a pendulum to determine the density of the ground\
  \ below you to find iron, and Foucault pendulums, which are the ones in museums\
  \ that knock sticks down if they go in a circle.\n\nThis is called a free-body diagram,\
  \ and this is a hanging pendulum. Let's call this 'L.' So, that\u2019s basically\
  \ it. We have a point mass dangling below a point of rotation, and we're going to\
  \ pretend that this stick has no mass, which we approximate by considering that\
  \ the mass is heavily concentrated toward this side. I'm going to relate this to\
  \ balance and posture shortly by lifting this up, but let's focus on the basics\
  \ for now. This is the mass, and then this is... Gravity is 9.8 meters per second\
  \ squared; let's call it 10. So, gravity is pulling down, which means that this\
  \ string is pulling up. Because gravity is pulling down at 10 meters per second\
  \ squared, but this thing isn't moving, we know that if there's a force acting on\
  \ a mass, then it has to be moving. If there's a force acting on the mass and it's\
  \ not moving, there has to be an equal and opposite force acting; it's statically\
  \ stable.\n\nGreat, so now let's push it up here. This is still the same length;\
  \ let's call this A. You don't have to worry about it. Gravity is still pulling\
  \ down with the same force and the same mass that it has, except now we know that\
  \ it will pull. This will now accelerate, so gravity is pulling like this. Then\
  \ we do some vector decomposition thing, right? The string is still pulling on it,\
  \ but it's not aligned with the axis of gravity. So, there's this leftover vector,\
  \ and that vector is pushing this way, which means it's going to accelerate that\
  \ way.\n\nIt does like this. So, details, details; but the important thing here\
  \ is just to note that basically you have a mass here that you can lift when it's\
  \ at its zero point. Right now, we can look at it. So, the angle, when it's here,\
  \ is zero. Let's say the angle of deflection from the vertical point is zero. Great.\
  \ Then we move it over here and say the angle is Theta, which is just some arbitrary\
  \ angular number\u2014it could be 12 degrees, could be one radian, doesn't matter.\
  \ When we put it over here and let it go, it will swing back. Intuitively, we kind\
  \ of know this; we've probably seen the demo where you pull the thing, let it go,\
  \ and it comes back and hits your face\u2014whatever! Unless, of course, the internet\
  \ edited the video and I didn't get hit in the face.\n\nAs it goes over here, it\
  \ will pick up speed, it'll pick up momentum, and it'll get back to the same point\
  \ that it was before. Except now, instead of its angle being zero and its velocity\
  \ being zero, its angle will still be zero, but its velocity will be high because\
  \ it's swinging. Then that will sort of take it up over here until it bleeds off\
  \ all that speed. And then, spoiler alert, that will be negative Theta if there's\
  \ no friction or whatever in the system. Now we're over here, and we're in the same\
  \ place we were before, so we're going to go back, and so we... Swing back and forth,\
  \ and there are two main things to note here. First, think about mechanics; you\
  \ essentially have potential and kinetic energy. If you don't, you're not considering\
  \ things like stretch and strain. When I take an object and throw it up, and then\
  \ catch it, when it leaves my hand, it has kinetic energy going up. But potential\
  \ and kinetic energy\u2014potential energy is mass times gravity times height. Mass\
  \ doesn't change, and gravity doesn't change. Let's just say potential energy is\
  \ the same as height. Kinetic energy is one half of mass times speed squared. Mass\
  \ doesn't change; who cares about the square? Let's just say kinetic energy is the\
  \ same thing as speed. So, you have your height and your speed, which essentially\
  \ define your mechanics. When you throw something into the air, you start out with\
  \ a lot of kinetic energy pointing up. As you go up to the next time step, gravity\
  \ will pull down, bleeding off some of your vertical height. Eventually, it will\
  \ take all of your upward kinetic energy, and then you'll be at this Apex Point,\
  \ at maximum height with zero velocity vertically. Then, it repeats that process,\
  \ following a nice parabolic trajectory. If you want it to be nicely parabolic,\
  \ you have to care about the square, but that's not important right now.\n\nNow,\
  \ regarding hanging pendulums\u2014I'll just mention this for the sake of symmetry,\
  \ as it may come up later, especially with jumping and similar concepts. When you\
  \ have a pendulum that is a simple harmonic oscillator swinging back and forth,\
  \ there are typically two to three key points to consider. One is at the apex where\
  \ it has maximum height but zero velocity, another is down at the minimum height\
  \ where it has maximum velocity, and then there's the opposite on the other side.\
  \ If you want to delve into state spaces, you can see the height here and the velocity\
  \ there; a nice pendulum will trace a beautiful ellipse. I recommend looking up\
  \ the Wikipedia page on pendulums; you'll find some fascinating GIFs of the state\
  \ space diagrams of hanging pendulums. The most important and relevant aspect for\
  \ the standing posture case is... What we're here to talk about is that this system\
  \ is passively stable. If I perturb it from its sort of happy zero point, the resulting\
  \ acceleration will pull it back towards that stable point. Because there's damping,\
  \ and energy gets lost in the system, it will eventually return back to where it\
  \ is. So, if this is time, we're doing dynamical systems modeling because I put\
  \ time on the axis. Congratulations, you now know how to do that. Now, this is Theta.\
  \ If I deflect this thing down to whatever Theta is, it will pull itself back towards\
  \ theta equals zero. It will pass through it because of the momentum and will oscillate\
  \ back and forth. If there's no friction, it will just do that forever. If there\
  \ is friction, it will return to its stable point.\n\nNow, all of these same dynamics\
  \ work if you flip it upside down, except it is no longer friendly and passively\
  \ stable. This is where it becomes Neuroscience. So now this is the floor. We were\
  \ doing a regular pendulum; we're now going to do an inverted pendulum. This is\
  \ another highly Google-able term: inverted pendulum human movement. You can find\
  \ all sorts of information regarding locomotion. \n\nSo now we have the same structure\
  \ attached to a point on the floor. We still have length L and mass M. I forgot\
  \ to mention that if you wanted to calculate the forces, like the Newtons and so\
  \ forth, since this is a meter, you could calculate those in units, although you\
  \ might not know kilograms either, but you could come up with a peculiar unit that\
  \ is equivalent. So, let's call the center M and the base of support. Remember,\
  \ with this type of system, I drew the vertical lines showing where the extent of\
  \ the base of support is. This area defines the region of controllability. Infimal,\
  \ a non-existent thing, is basically this deflection point here where Thea equals\
  \ Z. Whereas before, with a hanging pendulum, if I perturb it from that point, the\
  \ resulting acceleration will pull it back towards that point, and it will cycle\
  \ through there. If you're up here, you're not quite so lucky. This is the place\
  \ where\u2014this is called the vertical projection of the thing\u2014if this was\
  \ X, Y, let's say Y equals Z, and now this is X, that's the vertical projection.\
  \ Just like before, at some point in my life, I started erasing things on a board,\
  \ which is always fun. So, kind of like before, you have gravity pulling down on\
  \ this thing here, which means you have gravity pulling down here, and you have\
  \ the structure of the stick pushing up. If it's balanced here happily, then these\
  \ things cancel each other out perfectly and nothing bad happens. Now, if there's\
  \ a little bit of deflection from that point, in the same way, gravity is still\
  \ pulling down, the stick is doing its best, but they're misaligned. So, there's\
  \ a resulting force. Yeah, that's right. There are some geometry concepts you can\
  \ apply here, like trigonometry. But basically, the amount that they are separated\
  \ from each other means that the force\u2014basically, this stick is doing its best\
  \ to keep you up, but now it is also pushing you away. Gravity is pulling and also\
  \ leading to a force in a direction away from that happy, stable point. So with\
  \ a hanging pendulum, a deflection leads to a nice result, you know, relaxing back\
  \ to zero. This is even a small deflection that will push it. A passively unstable\
  \ system is one that, if disturbed, may not return to its original position. For\
  \ example, if you consider the ground as a reference point, when you hit the ground\
  \ or move around the angle, it tends to go back down to the bottom and is ultimately\
  \ pulled to the attractor point, which is the bottom. This is technically a stable\
  \ point; however, any infinitesimal shift will cause accumulating error, and it\
  \ will be pushed away. If you examine a state space diagram, you will notice regions\
  \ of the space that can be analyzed. I won't explain the details here, but you can\
  \ look for pictures or ask a bot about it. It's called beta, and there are both\
  \ periodic and non-periodic orbits within this space. In our particular case, a\
  \ non-periodic orbit implies that you fall over and hit the ground, or you have\
  \ to change your base of support to avoid hitting the floor. Much like science,\
  \ standing can be impossible in this context because it is a passively unstable\
  \ system that cannot be reconciled. Fortunately, we do have nervous systems that\
  \ provide passive stability. Congratulations! It can maintain balance, and it still\
  \ behaves like an inverted pendulum\u2014it's just that the center of mass is so\
  \ close to the ground that you have to perturb it significantly to push it out of\
  \ the stable zone, yet it can still fall off. The center of the base of support\
  \ remains a point with some extent. However, if I let go, it will slowly accelerate.\
  \ This is one of those compounding errors: it starts with a small acceleration,\
  \ but with each time step, the acceleration increases slightly, causing it to pick\
  \ up speed until it finally falls over. If that were the whole story, that would\
  \ be quite limiting. Luckily for us, we have a nonzero base of support and a whole\
  \ nervous system connected to various feedback mechanisms that we can use to actively\
  \ control it. This phenomenon is something many have experienced while balancing\
  \ a broom; if you haven't tried it, you should. I am monitoring the error in the\
  \ deflection from zero, using a combination of the weight in my hand and observing\
  \ the movement. I am actively moving the base of support; if it is accelerating\
  \ in one direction, I move the base of support in that direction. I'm trying to\
  \ keep it as close to zero as possible. I could allow it to swing back and forth,\
  \ but it's an active process that I'm engaged in, which allows the system to stay\
  \ upright, even though it is passively unstable. \n\nThe best video I have about\
  \ that shows a person standing on a ball. This is similar to the wobble board concept.\
  \ I put a link to that part; I'll fix it later. Since she is on her toes, her anatomical\
  \ base of support is very small. However, being on the ball allows her to spread\
  \ out the center of pressure, which enables her to maneuver her center of pressure\
  \ effectively to counteract movement.  \n\nWhen I see someone standing on that ball,\
  \ I think it's so impressive. It is impressive, but it's actually easier than standing\
  \ on solid ground because it extends her ability to move her base of support. If\
  \ I had an overlay, I would illustrate that. It\u2019s quite a lot of information,\
  \ and while it will all be on the test, there is actually no test. But do look up\
  \ the Wikipedia page about pendulums; it\u2019s surprisingly in-depth. Wikipedia\
  \ is the greatest intellectual achievement of humankind up to the present moment,\
  \ and anyone who says otherwise is mistaken. \n\nNow we will look very briefly at\
  \ what we discussed last time when I was here recording. We had the two recordings\
  \ of me balancing on my feet. On the one hand, I was balancing; I was standing on\
  \ two feet, leaning all the way forward, all the way back, all the way to the right,\
  \ and all the way to the left, and then sitting on one foot. I'm going to play this;\
  \ we will probably be able to tell which one it is. You can see that the ball here\
  \ represents the center of mass calculated in the ways that we do that. The sticks\
  \ are the rigid body segments that we used to make approximations. The mass of each\
  \ one has been calculated according to a table, with the center based off a point\
  \ on that table that shows where the mass is relative to the proximal and distal\
  \ joints. Proximal is close to the center, and distal is far away from the center.\
  \ You can sort of see stuff happening there. I'm going to go back to this at a later\
  \ date to show some additional information. This is the Blender stuff, and Aaron\
  \ was kind enough to pull in the raw data and get started showing basic representations\
  \ that are better equipped to illustrate the differences between those two conditions.\
  \ You can eyeball this, and you might see some differences, but that's not really\
  \ the results, and the effects are actually small and hard to see with the naked\
  \ eye. So, I'm going to show you more about this. It doesn't actually show that\
  \ distinction, but it provides a quick presentation of the kinds of ways we can\
  \ start analyzing this data to explore those distinctions. People who want to know\
  \ more about this can split off and learn about that. For others, we can start discussing\
  \ the neural systems and anatomical systems that contribute to that type of balance\
  \ and support.\n\nLong story short, if you're not familiar with coding, just let\
  \ it wash over you. Remember before I showed you that large spreadsheet of numbers?\
  \ The first thing you do is install the packages you need. NumPy is for numerical\
  \ processing in Python, pandas is for handling large spreadsheets, and Plotly is\
  \ for making plots. Many people have worked on these packages for many years. NumPy,\
  \ in particular, has a significant place in the history of numerical computing;\
  \ it has been developed over time by many contributors, making it a venerable tool.\n\
  \nTo use it, you point it to the location on your computer where the data is stored.\
  \ You tell it to load the body trajectories CSV file. CSV stands for comma-separated\
  \ values, so if you look into that text file, it consists of a series of numbers\
  \ separated by commas. That's how spreadsheets function at their most basic level;\
  \ similarly, a Microsoft Word document is just a more complex version of a raw text\
  \ document. CSV is the raw format that represents what happens in Excel.\n\nOnce\
  \ you take the data and import it, it will look something like this\u2014this formatted\
  \ square\u2014thanks to pandas, which handles these types of data. You extract the\
  \ center of mass trajectories and print them out to ensure everything is correct.\
  \ These are the names of the markers we are tracking. It\u2019s important, but you\
  \ don\u2019t have to worry about the details. Each of those points has a trajectory\
  \ over time. For example, this shows the x, y position of the nose on the x-axis\
  \ in meters, and the y-axis indicates time, where, in our case, time is represented\
  \ by the frame number. We could convert this to seconds by multiplying the frame\
  \ number by the frame rate, but the shape would remain the same; only the scale\
  \ would change. We calculated those Newtons assuming that this was a meter; you\
  \ would get a certain number until you realize I misled you\u2014this is not a meter,\
  \ it's actually 1.2 meters. The point to make is that those distinctions are arbitrary\
  \ until you want to compare your notes to somebody else who actually used a ruler.\
  \ Oftentimes, units are just like scalars; they really affect the shape of the data.\
  \ So, this is the path that my nose took on the x-axis of whatever you're looking\
  \ at. Pull it out; same thing, except this is now the XYZ. You see me jumping over\
  \ here, and the same thing applies for the center of mass. So basically, things\
  \ like the nose are raw measured points. Things like the center of mass are calculated\
  \ from all of those trajectories plus the kinematic tables. You just shuffle it\
  \ around to make a visualization. This is showing, for each point at every frame\
  \ that we have, the XYZ position of all relevant dots. The purple dot here represents\
  \ the center of mass. This is basically what scientific data visualization often\
  \ looks like. It's very raw and not really set up for this type of stuff; it's not\
  \ even scaling properly here. This could be cleaned up, and we'll do that going\
  \ forward. One of the huge advantages of using something like Blender is that this\
  \ is a visualization tool for professional visualizers. It can take the exact same\
  \ data; the difference is that this is being presented in something designed for\
  \ aesthetic visual output, whereas the other is something designed to plot two-dimensional\
  \ data, which begrudgingly added a 3D viewer. It's also good to sort of show that\
  \ you're not crazy because you can plot it, and it looks like a person. Also, notice\
  \ the dots are not connected because the connections between the dots are not a\
  \ measured part of the dataset. We know that the shoulder connects to the elbow,\
  \ but we measured the shoulder and we measured the elbow. So this is just a raw\
  \ representation. If you wanted to draw stick figures, you would need to have additional\
  \ information indicating how to connect the dots, which we are not providing at\
  \ this juncture. Now, we go through and pull out. We are going to look for the ground\
  \ projection, right? We're comparing the center of mass to support, so we don't\
  \ care about the Z height number anymore, as we did before when we were talking\
  \ about jumping. Now, we are looking at the ground. In projection, we discard the\
  \ Z-height number because in our world, following the right-hand rule, Z is up.\
  \ In some cases, Y is up, but no one says that X is up. So, we throw Z away. We\
  \ only take the center of mass in the X and Y directions, along with the points\
  \ that define the basic support: left heel, right heel, left foot, right foot, and\
  \ toe. This particular model has a very simplistic foot, with just a heel and a\
  \ toe. However, we extract those points, and that's enough to create a rectangle\
  \ on the ground. After doing some visualization coding and shuffling, you get this\
  \ nice animation, which we will play in a second. If you ever need to color-code\
  \ parts of the body, always make the right side red since it starts with 'R'. People\
  \ often get this wrong; from a moral standpoint, they are incorrect\u2014if you're\
  \ color coding the body, the right side must be red, while the left side should\
  \ be any color that isn\u2019t green, as red can confuse color perception. The right\
  \ foot, left foot, and center of mass are represented from a top-down view. This\
  \ is the control case; you can see me leaning back and forth. I encourage you to\
  \ stand up and lean to see what that feels like. Pay attention to how you can sense\
  \ when you're at the edge and notice that your heels have far less influence than\
  \ your toes. You develop a sense of the relationship between your base of support\
  \ and your center of mass, even if you don't fully realize it. Now, you can see\
  \ what's happening from the top down. You can observe how I'm shifting over, and\
  \ even though this is a simplified perspective of complex data, you still get a\
  \ good sense of what's occurring. You can also note that this is the moment when\
  \ I'm not holding the weight. I think my computer can handle this, and you can plot\
  \ the entire thing. It can become somewhat of a smear, which, if you're considering\
  \ dynamics, isn\u2019t an optimal way to visualize it, since it appears squished\
  \ over time. However, if you're interested in what space I covered, this is a great\
  \ way to illustrate all the positions that my foot has reached. Recording to see\
  \ if it works. It doesn't, but that's not your fault. Although I think it will work.\
  \ Oh, see, this is why it's good to have an external LIC nervous system. Okay, so\
  \ this is a Panda notebook, which I don't like in many ways, but they do the job.\
  \ I like that they're really good for simple tasks like this in an educational context,\
  \ but they don't scale in complexity at all. So people wind up getting especially\
  \ student-like objects stuck in Panda's notebooks for a long time in their trajectory.\
  \ Oh, that's the morning we calculated it in my dark mode. Looking good so far.\
  \ This is the same data where I'm holding 20% of my body mass in my can. I wasn't\
  \ careful; I realized that actually the better way to represent this would be to\
  \ hold it statically on one side and try to hold it out away from me because I was\
  \ shifting it around a lot. So you might have to just kind of gut check it. It would\
  \ also be nice if this was playing alongside the bigger visualization, which we\
  \ can do. Andre actually wrote some code to make that easily doable. And yeah, so\
  \ that's it. So, basically, the fact is, here I'm at my center of mass, which is\
  \ still my right. But when I shift over to my left, you can see that my foot is\
  \ moving, and you can see the center of mass has just shifted a little bit to the\
  \ outside. This is one of those things where I would like to actually show this\
  \ data more to make the point about this distinction. This is kind of like, oh yeah,\
  \ the effect is there, it could be measured, it could be done, but the behavior\
  \ was not well set up to produce good data. However, we can go back and record new\
  \ data, or we could just give ourselves more time standing there. We could take\
  \ this representation and couple it to the bigger visualization so we can actually\
  \ verify it. We could make the pause button work and then pause it to show that,\
  \ yes, I'm standing here, stable and supported, but my center of mass is outside\
  \ of my base of support. Because this center of mass is not the actual center of\
  \ mass, since we're not accounting for the fact that my hand, which instead of being\
  \ one percent of my body mass, is now twenty-one percent of my body mass. We would\
  \ have to recalculate the center of mass with that in mind, and then theoretically,\
  \ it would shift back and start looking like the regular control condition. Okay,\
  \ got that? Good, great. As per usual, I've also gone longer than I intended to,\
  \ but that's okay; good stuff. We have another twenty minutes, which I think is\
  \ enough time to sort of get started with some things. So, by a show of hands, who\
  \ likes code and data? Who is interested in code and data? You don't have to be\
  \ good at it, you don't have to have done it before, and you don't have to expect\
  \ that you will be successful at it, but who is at least interested in seeing what\
  \ it would look like? We can get you to the point where you can click the buttons\
  \ and have the squiddle show up. Who is interested in that versus who is less interested?\
  \ Code people? Okay, cool. And then non-code people? Great. The biggest problem\
  \ would have been if everybody said they wanted to do code, so this is great. Code\
  \ people, I guess push back, and then, Eron, can you just try to get them as far\
  \ as you can? You can get towards this, like mostly just probably best to code.\
  \ CL Theo, this notebook is now great. Other people, we're going to... I want you\
  \ to do the same kind of group work thing again. Probably by next week, I will be\
  \ able to have some sort of more feedback loop with the pod, but right now we\u2019\
  re still just passively pouring into it. Basically, ask it the questions that come\
  \ up for you when you were watching me talk about all this stuff. If you are interested\
  \ in the mechanics of it, you can ask more about the robotics, control theory, analog\
  \ systems, and P stuff. If you're more of a biologist, just think about the types\
  \ of neural systems that would have to be in place for this to work, like you do\
  \ not have a center of mass detector; that's not a thing that exists in your nervous\
  \ system. You have a bunch of other modalities that give you other types of information,\
  \ and that has the sort of effective reality that we could call functional equivalencies\
  \ for those. I always had a professor say that philosophy of mind is so hard that\
  \ it makes functionalism look interesting, which I will not explain. I will just\
  \ say you can chew on that if you want. So, let's get started; we have about 15\
  \ minutes. Do these chats in the channel for this lecture and just pop some open.\
  \ Again, whatever you found interesting, whatever you wanted to know more about,\
  \ whatever sort of thing I said... don't work alone; work in groups. Clump up according\
  \ to your local environment. Code people, go to the back, and Aon will meet you\
  \ there. If you're not a code person and you're in the back, you might want to move\
  \ forward. Do it! This may be your only chance. If you\u2019re interested in both,\
  \ do coding for now and you can come back to this later. If you're interested in\
  \ doing both, this is not an either/or situation; you will be able to drop this\
  \ opinion later. At your earliest convenience, there is a benefit if you have a\
  \ clump that is congealing in a reliable way. There's a benefit to having at least\
  \ one person from your clump gaining some code experience, but you will not be evaluated\
  \ on anything. Okay, I'm going to stop this report now."

  text: "Okay, great. Hello, and welcome to October. If you already had one of those,\
    \ welcome to October 8th. So, today we're going to talk about balance, the center\
    \ of mass, and base of support. After about an hour of discussing these topics,\
    \ we'll do some group activities again. This will be our first technical split\
    \ option. If you are interested in code and programming, you'll have the opportunity\
    \ to focus on that. If you're not interested in that area, you can hang out, and\
    \ we'll do more literature review-type activities. If you've never done it but\
    \ are curious, then you can still participate, as interest and experience are\
    \ separate matters. \n\nThe first thing I want to show before we get into the\
    \ meat of today's discussion is a rolling checkpoint throughout the semester.\
    \ This involves the AI aspect of the class, where I have now an initial example\
    \ of scraping the server. This means pulling all of the chats you've been having\
    \ with the bot. Effectively, I extract the markdown text file attached to the\
    \ top of each chat, run it through the AI to summarize it, and pull out the main\
    \ points and topics. I do this for each chat, each channel, each category, and\
    \ then for the whole server. The idea is to use this to get a sense of what you\
    \ are all working on and what interests you. For now, it\u2019s descriptive; it\
    \ reflects what you are doing, and you can look at it if you want. \n\nIn the\
    \ second half of class, we will start to steer this a bit more. We\u2019ll look\
    \ at what topics seem to be coming up for many of you and gather more details\
    \ about those subjects. We can analyze and say, 'Oh, they are really interested\
    \ in this topic. Let's discuss it in the next lecture.' This process is more of\
    \ a feedback type of approach. The results will be provided as a ZIP file, which\
    \ you can download to your downloads folder, whatever that may be for you."

  text: "You can unzip that so that it's just a regular folder. Oh, come on now. Is\
    \ it giving you that invalid message? So, it's here. In the server, in the resources\
    \ channel at the top, there's a thread called \"Server Scrape Checkpoints\" and\
    \ there's a zip file. I am totally happy saying that this checkpoint zip file\
    \ is corrupted, and we'll figure that out later. Cool! So, if you can figure it\
    \ out, great. If not, it's basically a bunch of poorly formatted summaries of\
    \ the things we've been talking about, and we just call this foreshadowing.\n\n\
    There are a couple of other things in that resources channel too that I added.\
    \ One is this link up here to a YouTube playlist of these videos, except for the\
    \ last video's video, because I forgot to save it. I forgot to hit save at the\
    \ end of this, and I wasn't saving to a video format that is forgiving of closing\
    \ the thing mid-recording, so that video was lost. RIP lost data; it happens.\n\
    \nAnd then, yeah, that's another one of those like maybe we'll get to the point\
    \ where I can scrape the video, pull the transcript, and get the topics out to\
    \ put that into the notes, but we'll see about that. There's also this link to\
    \ another playlist called \"AI Stuff,\" where I talk about things like building\
    \ Skelly Bot and using it in classroom settings like this, so if you're interested\
    \ in that kind of meta AI ed-tech stuff, watch that.\n\nYeah, and then the third\
    \ thing I added to the server is in this lectures category over here. This one\
    \ down here has a string of numbers which is the date: 2024-01-08. That's just\
    \ a way to write your date concisely; it's called little-endian, meaning the little\
    \ things are at the end of the number. So, big-endian, little-endian\u2014that's\
    \ what that means if you ever come across it again. Composite people might know\
    \ it; no one else will.\n\nIn that, I put a link to an outline of what I'm going\
    \ to talk about today, which is some tutorial notes. These links don\u2019t work,\
    \ but maybe you can figure it out. They\u2019re over here. Okay, cool. Well, so\
    \ far I don\u2019t really give you any options. Um, yeah, so Obsidian calls folders."

  text: "Vaults. You want to be opening that folder as a vault. If you feel like playing\
    \ with that stuff, go to any chat and just download the MBB, which stands for\
    \ markdown. It's the thing that turns plain text into formatted text. You just\
    \ type it out in the raw, and then if the .md thing that you're looking at knows\
    \ how to process markdown files, it turns it into that. So, download any chat\
    \ at the top or download this markdown file. I feel it is the seed of the resolution\
    \ revolution because we have just generally internalized this idea that text is\
    \ like Microsoft or Google, when it really isn\u2019t. Text is like a behavior\
    \ that you do on a keyboard, and we want it to look nice, but this is the raw\
    \ that we actually care about. It's also the first sort of entry point to acknowledge\
    \ that there\u2019s such a thing as interpreted text. You type this thing, and\
    \ the computer knows how to make it pretty. Also, Google Aaron Schwartz. If you\
    \ don\u2019t know who that is, he\u2019s one of the people who came up with the\
    \ original definitions for markdown. You should look up who he is and then steal\
    \ every paper ever published. A lot of professors say, \"Be careful; don\u2019\
    t go to HUB or you\u2019ll accidentally steal papers.\" I'm telling you explicitly,\
    \ go to sci-hub, steal papers, steal textbooks from LibGen. As a scientist operating\
    \ under my academic freedom, it is the best thing I can do for you to say steal\

    \ speaking, it does. That's why we do cell biology, genetics, particle physics,\
    \ and study periodic tables. These are all fundamentally reductionist approaches\
    \ to science. Reductionism may sound like an insult, but it's not; it's just a\
    \ description of a way of looking at things. \n\nThe counter to that doesn't really\
    \ have a defined name, but I generally think of it as more of a holism. Instead\
    \ of taking the thing and chopping it into little parts\u2014because the problem\
    \ that reductionism solves is that science is impossible; rule number one: it\
    \ can't be done. We mere primates do not have access to capital T true facts of\
    \ the world. We can only approximate them with a bunch of sloppy empirical measurements\
    \ and then statistics. The problem of induction and black swans are related concepts\
    \ you might want to dig into. \n\nSince we can't actually achieve true knowledge\
    \ of the real world, we have to cheat and take various side steps. The traditional\
    \ Western reductionist view of science is to chop things up into little pieces\
    \ and hope those pieces fit together into something that resembles the whole.\
    \ A more holistic approach cheats in a different way. Instead of taking the whole\
    \ thing and chopping it into smaller parts to consider in isolation, you take\
    \ the whole complicated thing and try to squish it down into what you think is\
    \ the simplest possible model that captures the dynamics of the whole system.\
    \ \n\nFor example, the concept of center of mass, which I'll show pictures of\
    \ in a moment, fundamentally illustrates this approach. I've mentioned before\
    \ that this is not something you're likely to find in specific textbooks; it\u2019\
    s more about ideas I've cobbled together in my research, inspired largely by robotics\
    \ approaches. If you look up passive dynamic walkers, that's a classic case\u2014\
    Andy Ruina, Steve Collins, and others have explored how taking a complex object\
    \ and reducing it down to a single point mass can be very helpful in trying to\

    \ have length L and mass M. I forgot to mention that if you wanted to calculate\
    \ the forces, like the Newtons and so forth, since this is a meter, you could\
    \ calculate those in units, although you might not know kilograms either, but\
    \ you could come up with a peculiar unit that is equivalent. So, let's call the\
    \ center M and the base of support. Remember, with this type of system, I drew\
    \ the vertical lines showing where the extent of the base of support is. This\
    \ area defines the region of controllability."

    \ point, when you hit the ground or move around the angle, it tends to go back\
    \ down to the bottom and is ultimately pulled to the attractor point, which is\
    \ the bottom. This is technically a stable point; however, any infinitesimal shift\
    \ will cause accumulating error, and it will be pushed away. If you examine a\
    \ state space diagram, you will notice regions of the space that can be analyzed.\
    \ I won't explain the details here, but you can look for pictures or ask a bot\
    \ about it. It's called beta, and there are both periodic and non-periodic orbits\
    \ within this space. In our particular case, a non-periodic orbit implies that\
    \ you fall over and hit the ground, or you have to change your base of support\
    \ to avoid hitting the floor. Much like science, standing can be impossible in\
    \ this context because it is a passively unstable system that cannot be reconciled.\
    \ Fortunately, we do have nervous systems that provide passive stability. Congratulations!\
    \ It can maintain balance, and it still behaves like an inverted pendulum\u2014\
    it's just that the center of mass is so close to the ground that you have to perturb\
    \ it significantly to push it out of the stable zone, yet it can still fall off.\
    \ The center of the base of support remains a point with some extent. However,\
    \ if I let go, it will slowly accelerate. This is one of those compounding errors:\
    \ it starts with a small acceleration, but with each time step, the acceleration\
    \ increases slightly, causing it to pick up speed until it finally falls over.\
    \ If that were the whole story, that would be quite limiting. Luckily for us,\
    \ we have a nonzero base of support and a whole nervous system connected to various\
    \ feedback mechanisms that we can use to actively control it. This phenomenon\

    back, all the way to the right, and all the way to the left, and then sitting
    on one foot. I'm going to play this; we will probably be able to tell which one
    it is. You can see that the ball here represents the center of mass calculated
    in the ways that we do that. The sticks are the rigid body segments that we used
    to make approximations. The mass of each one has been calculated according to
    a table, with the center based off a point on that table that shows where the
    mass is relative to the proximal and distal joints. Proximal is close to the center,
    and distal is far away from the center. You can sort of see stuff happening there.
    I'm going to go back to this at a later date to show some additional information.
    This is the Blender stuff, and Aaron was kind enough to pull in the raw data and
    get started showing basic representations that are better equipped to illustrate
    the differences between those two conditions. You can eyeball this, and you might
    see some differences, but that's not really the results, and the effects are actually

    \ over time. For example, this shows the x, y position of the nose on the x-axis\
    \ in meters, and the y-axis indicates time, where, in our case, time is represented\
    \ by the frame number. We could convert this to seconds by multiplying the frame\

    in my can. I wasn't careful; I realized that actually the better way to represent
    this would be to hold it statically on one side and try to hold it out away from

    my right. But when I shift over to my left, you can see that my foot is moving,
    and you can see the center of mass has just shifted a little bit to the outside.
    This is one of those things where I would like to actually show this data more
    to make the point about this distinction. This is kind of like, oh yeah, the effect
    is there, it could be measured, it could be done, but the behavior was not well
    set up to produce good data. However, we can go back and record new data, or we
    could just give ourselves more time standing there. We could take this representation
    and couple it to the bigger visualization so we can actually verify it. We could
    make the pause button work and then pause it to show that, yes, I'm standing here,
    stable and supported, but my center of mass is outside of my base of support.
    Because this center of mass is not the actual center of mass, since we're not
    accounting for the fact that my hand, which instead of being one percent of my
    body mass, is now twenty-one percent of my body mass. We would have to recalculate
    the center of mass with that in mind, and then theoretically, it would shift back
    and start looking like the regular control condition. Okay, got that? Good, great.

    have to have done it before, and you don't have to expect that you will be successful
