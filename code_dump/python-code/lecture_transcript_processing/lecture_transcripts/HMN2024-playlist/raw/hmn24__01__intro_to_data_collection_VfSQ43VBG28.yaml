full_transcript: hello we're recording now spectacular but that's not I mean so yeah
  fmri is great kind of uh I have doubts but um it is like the best tool that we have
  for looking inside of a person's brain without opening it up um there's also things
  like EEG there's also stuff like f near I don't really like or trust any of those
  either because they're all just so abstracted away from the thing that we actually
  hypothetically care about which is the desum desum desat Des of the kind of research
  that's multiple yeah um the desideratum of a given research area is the thing that
  you want to know why' you come here why' you show up what's your goal that is the
  desideratum of the field of inquiry and I would argue that the field of Neuroscience
  is largely designed to help us understand what the hell this is like this this stuff
  right I left my house got on a bike did a bunch of this somehow my dinner from last
  night fueled the energy cost somehow and now I'm here and I'm talking to you and
  I'm telling you that that happened um and a lot of the scientific world that we
  live in this sort of has this very reductionist feel and sort of underlying philosophy
  of reductionism where the goal is to measure things with increasing Precision at
  the at finer and finer levels with the hopes that we'll someday get to the bottom
  of it and figure it all out um and so because of that it's kind of somewhat by necessity
  of technology and somewhat by you know sort of feedback loops driven there um the
  tools that we use to measure research often come at the cost of the ecological validity
  of the data meaning that you're putting me in a tube and shooting big magnets at
  my head and saying oh look at what your brain is doing that tells me something about
  you out in the world um over evolutionary time and over you know course of your
  day and it does to some extent because you're measuring the same engine that's driving
  the behavior when I'm out doing stuff but this you're getting a very precise measurement
  of the thing doing something different from the thing that you actually care about
  which is behaving out in the real world right so it's kind of there's often a trade-off
  in fact there's perhaps necessarily A trade-off between empirical precision and
  God in heaven and ecological validity one second I got this so if we can't record
  what's going on in my brain because it's unfortunately 2024 and we just can't do
  that yet and some people will say oh no you can put e EEG on people uh you can do
  fmri on people and it's like yeah you can but I don't but yeah let me phrase that
  no you can't but a lot of people believe that you can and we respect their efforts
  um so if we are talking about trade-offs between like empirical precision and ecological
  validity anytime there's a trade-off there's often two sides to that so I'd say
  all the way on the farthest side of like empirical Precision um reductionist philosophy
  is the eiz measurements that's like you're sticking a a electrode into the the goop
  itself and looking at how it spikes and you get unbelievably precise measurements
  typically on nonhuman animals but sometimes you get to do that um but in those situations
  in particular the animal or whatever that you're well it's always an animal um human
  or non-human animal is never doing anything particularly interesting it's just usually
  attached to something because the technology requires it there are new technologies
  coming online that allow animals to move around as they're being measured but and
  I'm like working on some of those things with some people but those are new types
  of studies new types of tools new types of equipment an alternative approach is
  to say let's go the other way and let's just measure the behavior as closely as
  we can to the desired the desideratum the sort of the case study the ecologically
  valid measurements uh the ecologically valid behaviors let's record those as well
  as we can and then we can make inferences about what's going on and the inner parts
  the hidden variables the parts that we can't actually measure directly and if we're
  lucky then the people who are out there cracking open skulls and taking like electrical
  recordings we'll share their notes and we can and they can say oh hey we found this
  part and that part and we think this does this other thing and I can say oh well
  I saw this behavior and that behavior and those two things kind of line up these
  things don't but those things do and in a perfect world we all get to do nice good
  happy research end of class we're done um but yeah no unfortunately it's actually
  slightly more complicated than that um yeah so let's sort of for the moment put
  the reductionists to the side there's more than enough of them they're very well
  funded they'll be fine and let's work on this other part where we try to figure
  out so that that thing I said before where I was like you just measure the real
  behavior and then you study that and you're good to go it turns out that part also
  quite difficult and you saw in that lab some of the big fancy tools that we use
  to do that and it measures the environmental forces excuse me for pushing into your
  space um yeah so we can measure things like Movement we can measure things like
  forces we use these big fancy tools to do it actually uh you want to help me out
  but yeah guess yeah just go ahead and start setting things up just freeo cap it
  regular and I'll keep blathering about stuff do you have on here yeah no I got it
  cond activate that's why I was late I was like oh it's been a while since I've used
  that computer to do anything ah and I'm gonna move this up do we know how to raise
  that thing it's probably over here cam privacy manual control I don't see anything
  obvious oh it might be stupid and just well unlikely but it might be like pull it
  down when it comes up oh maybe it's got the thing on it no it's probably powered
  um it might be like it turns it off when this thing turns off uh it's fine we'll
  figure it out that's good enough for no oh uh yeah and also turn this off yeah so
  this is connected but because it's being it's being held by OBS these things turn
  off so there's an order of operations that you have to do if it's like if you if
  you turn OBS on and it grabs that camera then you can do free mo cap and it only
  sees these otherwise it gets weird Okay so as I mentioned I spent a lot of my time
  over the past half decade or so uh messing with cheap cameras because I had a whole
  crisis of conscience around how freaking expensive that lab was and even if I wasn't
  like morally perturbed by it I hate that equipment it's garbage that software is
  the worst like as in terms of like physical measurement apparati spectacular the
  force plates are great the cameras are very fast and precise but the software is
  abysmal and it's super duper duper expensive um and even if it wasn't it like sucks
  to use and there's a lot of manual effort manual labor it's basically 90s Tech um
  which I haven't been doing this since the 9s but I have been doing this since that
  was less of a dig um and yeah so cool nice so also there's been a lot of technological
  advancement since the 90s uh and a lot of them has focused on these weird objects
  this is called camera cameras measure light uh light is trying to get a sense of
  color I might have to take my shoes off because they're yeah I'll take I'll do it
  later um oh yeah right so basically uh long story short so this is free moap it's
  a free open source markless motion capture system that works in conceptually very
  similar way to the big fancy space in the lab um did you guys see that they show
  you like the 2D views with the intensi you see like you move the thing around it's
  like oh look at those dots on the on the screen and then they get triangulated remember
  because they triangles it's mostly triangles um uh and then you get the 3D information
  based off of that so those old systems I say old like say the traditional marker
  based motion capture system basically constrains the world that it's measuring to
  make it easier to measure you take a you put a marker like a DOT specially designed
  dot that uses retrolective stuff which is the the things on your shoes which have
  interesting Optical properties um and you put those on the person on the thing that
  you're trying to measure and that thing is designed to work with the cameras to
  make the cameras able to track that thing in 2D and then there's a bunch of fancy
  secret expensive software doing 20 thou 20 uh like 2 to 3,000-year Old math um to
  figure out where that dot is in space um um so again you kind of have that theme
  where you're constraining the world a bit to make it easier to measure in the fmri
  or in the eiz world you can strain the behavior by telling the person not to move
  you constrain the behavior by like removing the skull from the thing that's getting
  in the because the little electrodes are wimpy um but you're you're changing the
  thing that you're measuring in order to make it easier to measure meure by necessity
  because of the because of the um that's probably good uh and there's typically kind
  of like a tradeoff there like as a general rule the more you constrain the environment
  that you're measuring the easier it is to measure because you are exerting your
  like you're looking at the thing and you're saying I'm going to make this easier
  for myself and that typically works if you're good at what you're doing but you
  also wind up affecting the thing that you're trying to measure and that may or may
  not matter for the desert orom of the research that you're trying to do um so for
  example if I was trying to like to do the traditional map thing I have to bring
  people into the lab so that's its own kind of difficulty um I have to put them in
  the spandex suit I have to put the dots on them I have to Cali the room you know
  all these things may or may not matter um but I had to do that for a long time because
  that was the only way to get a camera to track an object in two dimensions and nowadays
  we have other ways of doing that so I'm going to go through a bit of a process right
  now and in what will be a recurring theme uh just going to move this over there
  so I don't trip on it and kill myself this is going to be one of those things where
  um it's going to make more sense later what's happening uh because ideally if it
  all works out we're going to use this data for the rest of the semester and sort
  of look at it and try to understand what's going on and try to sort of get a sense
  of how we can use measurements of what happened in the past to make inferences about
  what may or may not be going on in the meat in the goop on the basis of the measurements
  we manag to get uh because I'm going to go out here in a second it's going to take
  I'm not like that but um there's a whole process I guess we can turn off the projector
  when it's ready to go or we can turn it to that it probably won't pick up yeah um
  yeah could you maybe just tune it so it yeah that one might need want to go like
  behind those desks or something um yeah because one of the realities is that if
  I wanted to know about what let's say it was Michael who was moving the triangle
  around and I wanted to know something about what like what were the motor commands
  that were going to his muscle parts um my ability to answer that question is dependent
  on what I managed to record like the true fact answer of that question of what were
  the motor commands that were sent the that information is dead and gone fuzzed off
  into the past it went to the same place that the dot data went after you didn't
  record it and you can never get it back it dissolves into the foam of whatever happens
  when time goes forward um and so what that means is that the actual moment of recording
  is very very important this is the moment all this data is going away um but because
  we're not recording it because I didn't click the big red button but when I do that
  will be the only record that we have of whatever was going on and we're going to
  try to use it to understand what was going on in this weird goopy thing there are
  two the two weirdest things in the universe are light and human behavior and we're
  going to try to use the one to understand the other basically impossible but we
  can approximate it iteratively over time okay let's see yeah could you like tilt
  them down and Center this one yeah just a little bit less height sorry thank you
  and yeah that's right okay right I forgot like angles matter here and uh try to
  get it like straight like this straight if you can yeah so this is because this
  is the part you can't do again except that you can you can do it again I can just
  record myself twice um but this is the moment of transduction transduction is a
  great word that means when energy changes from one form to another uh in this particular
  case light is going through the lens bending hitting a sensor which is a weird rectangle
  and being transformed into a pattern of electrical impulses if that sounds familiar
  it's because that's what you are that's what you do at least in this rough region
  your eyes are not cameras but there are similarities at some level and so yeah so
  we're going to be measuring rectangles of light we're going to be measuring three
  rectangles of light taking samples from three light cones from Three locations and
  we're going to be pulling one measurement of light intensity at three wavelengths
  r g and B red green and blue uh 30 times per second from three three devices um
  actually we don't the device's loccation unfortunately we can we're going to try
  to guess later by cheating and measuring something that we know what the answer
  is this is called calibration and then we're going to guess what the location of
  those devices were and then we're going to look at the rectangles of colors we're
  going to call them colors even though it's pretty abstract um and then try to go
  from there down some strange epistemic path with various forms of computation in
  math most of which you will not have to worry about because it'll all happen very
  quickly um and then try to make inferences about what brains do central nervous
  systems really cool yeah thanks what's that want meay here buttons or yeah uh yeah
  yeah um I guess I'll I'll calibrate first and then I'll sort of make a plan um f8
  looking there uh all right shoes are coming off I apologize but this will not be
  the last time I'm taking my shoes off cuz my shoes are black and my socks are white
  and the ground is dark and we care about where my feet are so we're measuring light
  remember like we're not measuring feet we're measuring light and then we're inferring
  feet so we're going to make our job a little bit easier by putting these things
  there if I cared about the grippiness of these shoes I would that would this would
  be a mistake in terms of this experiment but I don't don't care about the grippiness
  of shoes so this manipulation of reality I think is forgivable okay there now it's
  always the feet and okay so if you recall we're going to measure we're going to
  record stuff from cameras right there's subtle hints in the environment that that's
  what's going to happen you're going to this guy follows me if I ask him to nice
  good job that's a two axis gimbal you have a three AIS gimbal we have two of them
  right here we'll talk about that later uh so we're going to be recording from the
  cameras cameras measure light we talked about that we're going to want to know where
  the cameras are that's going to be pretty important CU we're going to be trying
  to measure space uh and so we're going to so we're going to do a a thing we call
  calibration which is basically a fancy word for trying to measure where all the
  cameras are relative to each other so the way that we do that is we cheat because
  later we're going to record something that's a weird unknown goopy wobbly object
  one of these and that thing is going to be really hard to measure and so the first
  thing we want to do is confirm to our ourselves that the tool is actually doing
  what we think it's doing and so we're going to cheat by measuring something where
  we know the answer to the question this is a grid see all the squares it's the the
  squares are 58 mm on a side you can see I wrote that right there obviously you can
  see that from the back and it's got these little patterns here that are custom made
  to be easy to track by cameras so we're going to start by showing a camera is this
  friendly calibration object and then they're going to use that and sort of infer
  well based off math that a combination of me and tens of thousands of my closest
  friends wrote over the past 30 to 40 years or so based off math that's we've been
  doing for thousands of years um and the result of that will be an estimate about
  the location of each camera measured in uh six it's the six degree of Freedom estimate
  of where the cameras are six degrees of freedom means that there's six numbers involved
  three positions XYZ and three rotations XY Z with position and rotation you can
  measure the location and rotation of a rigid body in space but don't worry about
  that it won't be on the test there won't be a test you'll just just let it wash
  over you okay um yeah like there's a a spot you I think we turn the projector off
  okay there was like a a a white bar across this uh from the projector and that it
  tends not to like that um oh I lied oh that was So Graceful I can leave it up there
  so the next person who's shorter than me will just be screwed no we won't do that
  um okay so once they calibrate them you and you don't touch that camera you don't
  touch that camera nobody touch any cameras deal great because if you do I'll have
  to do this again okay um I guess it's not I don't know about how yeah you want to
  I guess we have another Spotlight too yeah I don't know is it around is it is it
  is it available yeah um yeah you might as well ah let's see yub yub yub is there
  a a plug on this side of the room anywhere no NOP H yeah let's don't eat that here
  I'm going to write out stuff that we're going to do just basically just like feed
  the cable as far as it'll go the last time I recorded data in class it became the
  test data for this project for like two years so I'm not saying that's what we're
  going to do now but I have learned over the course of my life that oh there's no
  plug over here either how does anybody plug anything in in this [Music] world oh
  yeah that's not going to make it that far but that's fine better than nothing um
  1238 okay so when I actually get to the point of recording stuff I'm going to stand
  do a range of motion do a lean do a one foot stand uh then I'm gonna let's do this
  separately and that'll be that and then we'll do another one where I do lean and
  one foot stand with the kettle bell writing this down don't don't it's not important
  yeah it's not this is for me um and I'm going to do another one where I jump time
  10 and then big jump great um it is a known effect if you have anything that has
  a record button when you push record your cognitive facilities go so you need to
  do everything you can to externalize thoughts before you push the record button
  um so just kind of taken that time yeah that's good thank you okay light is very
  important for cameras um that one isn't going to have any oh I guess I can just
  get closer oh okay yeah I was confused because they're in a different order on that
  screen um okay go ahead and cool so now I am basically just showing the board to
  all of the cameras and the most important thing here is that each of the cameras
  has friends that there are uh sufficient frames where each camera can see the board
  along with one of its compatriots um shared views probably good and wish I could
  turn the projector on and off but it's slow so I guess we'll see see now I know
  how to do it oh see other professors just show up and like give PowerPoints that's
  like I don't know how to do that um could you pull up the terminal so okay so it's
  thinking and what it's doing here is can you like Control Plus IG it does it work
  no well anyways if you so basically this is like just readouts of like what it's
  doing under the hood and it's basically just doing a bunch of geometry and right
  now this number here we probably can't read it says 8.95 that is the number of frames
  that were recorded from all of the cameras uh there's two things to worry about
  time and space time we handle through synchronization and there's a bunch of many
  gallons of my life poured into making sure that this thing records frames from each
  camera synchronously like it within it's a 30fps camera which means it every frame
  you get a new frame every 33 milliseconds I use frame interchangeably with image
  um because of like the history of Cinema I guess but so we have 895 synchronized
  frames from each camera and that synchronization is sort of how we do the time synchrony
  if I compared the frame that happened at T time equals 12 from this one and compared
  that to the one that this one got at time equals 13 I can't use those to figure
  out where the thing I'm measuring is because that's you know they'll get different
  times so we do okay this is where we tell when this third one finishes it will either
  fail or not fail and we'll find out together um yeah so you have synchronization
  between you get synchronized measurements from Three locations three locations which
  are not moving that's important this guy would not be a good tool camera because
  it moves so I could do the calibration thing but then I would it would move around
  and then I can't get good measurements um we're good anyone here done any like optimization
  stuff and would touch that in your life people heard the term optimization like
  weird math um this is doing optimization right now to figure out basically use the
  measure measurements that we got to figure out where each camera was in space and
  it says it was successful could you uh find that and pop it open yeah yeah just
  you can do that in there think I think just double click that yeah okay so this
  is where the cameras presumably are camera zero 1 and two because we start counting
  from zero because we someone decided that was a good idea uh Matrix size is that
  that's the pixels so we're it's a low resolution image but that's okay uh rotation
  so this is camera zero so the translation translation is like moving so basically
  it's position um translation from the origin 0 because it's camera 0 great uh this
  one's camera 1 it's - 2719 516 these are millimeters so roughly 2.7 M away if this
  said 20,000 I'd be like oh  something messed up but I don't know if it I don't know
  if this is right but it gut check scale is that it's close to enough so that's we
  we like that and then this one down here 1160 so it looks like the order is 0 1
  2 is that right doesn't really matter is that right oh and also there's these other
  guys which matter a lot and then these rotation variables those are Oiler angles
  um when you see it written down it's spelled e u l e r and youd probably think ooler
  uler and then you hear people say oer those are the same guy so FYI um XYZ rotation
  so this is the x axis this is the y axis this is the z- axis rotation around X rotation
  around y rotation around Z these are radians I trust that that's where those cameras
  live great so we we have an estimate of where the cameras are um now we can try
  to measure more interesting Behavior Uh yeah I guess turn it off how did I do it
  was there oh no my hubris H the back is the answer we'll see okay so I'm Huck Finning
  my pants so that more of my body will be visible ible um cuz it's too cold to wear
  shorts and remember we're going to be pretending like I'm one of these and so like
  it's better if the joints are visible because these pants are kind of open so if
  I were to we down here it's harder to tell what my knee is doing right it's harder
  for you as a human to do it so it would definitely be harder for a rectangle silicone
  to do it silicon whatever um okay so let's just do let's do four separate recordings
  so we'll call the first one Ro and then the second one uh balance control second
  uh third one balance kettle bell and then jumping so yeah nice at start uh yes where
  and I need yeah a pose a pose a pose a pose it helps me uh because okay so yeah
  so I'm going to we're going to take four recordings and the first one's kind of
  like again kind of calibration I'm going to be doing kind of like boring stuff like
  simple control standing stuff just to sort of make sure things look right in later
  stuff because in these later ones are going to be moving more and doing more interesting
  stuff so start with something simple so we're going to start with an a pose which
  is T pose we've heard of that it was like a joke for a while this is the uh this
  happens because under the hood and all your favorite animation things it's it's
  these guys and if you set all the joint angles to zero it's that so whenever the
  code up under the hood and the data becomes Unbound to the Model T pose so that's
  why that happens um T pose a pose because get it because of um we tend to do an
  A Pose in this world because it takes up less space and uh oh right yeah um I'm
  going to put this like here try get it just like give me a sense of where to stand
  yeah let's move me first and then cool oh there's a plug the whole time oh well
  you should have stopped me what's no no I never said bet that's called gaslighting
  very effective uh it's good to like practice recognizing that because just shows
  up uh okay what are we doing in class who are you people Jesus Christ uh the top
  one okay helpful see it's really helpful to have like an externalized nervous system
  to handle certain tasks and a pose standing range of motion I'll just count it off
  okay can you swing like you're do with range motion h oh well so this one oh I see
  yeah right backwards you guys can't see that unfortunately but it looks like this
  but but three of them okay uh yes okay 1 1,00 2 1,00 3 1,00 4 1,00 5 1,000 and I
  guess I'm still standing I think yeah standing is fine um range of motion so this
  is the top one then we got these ones and we got those ones they only go one way
  got these wrist got hands which which is cool uh got a waist which is neat we got
  one leg that goes like this we got another leg that goes like that uh if I missed
  anything that'll definitely get it okay good um we should I wish we had told it
  not to Auto process because then we could keep recording shut it down let it let
  it finish synchronizing first yeah let it finish synchronizing then Loop it through
  yeah so from that we're going to be able to measure the first thing is going to
  be the the well this happens every recording but the first one's kind of a simpler
  one um we will get the length of the rigid bodies so I tried to go through the catalog
  of wobbly bits and move my rigid body through roughly their full range of motion
  um and if we wanted to use that later actually don't have any pipelines that really
  use that data but useful to look at um and now we're restarting it to get another
  one because we forgot to click the button that says Don't Auto process just so had
  yeah I was so close to using like the new trying to use the new one for this class
  but that seemed like a bad idea uh freeo cap en dash EnV yeah um yes so the next
  Parts we're going to look are going to be about posture and balance and standing
  and balance and whatnot so it's weird as hell that we're bipeds first thing it's
  wild move to just use two little feet it's pretty much it's us Birds angry bears
  and kangaroos at a full hop are the only guys that really stand on two feet um there's
  a long weird story about how we got here long story short we used to be basically
  squirrels lived in the trees so we were doing this on the branches and then someday
  we were like let's stand up and go over there and the rest the rest is history got
  way complicated after that but bold move um so this is one of those things where
  like we look animals do stuff and we're like oh my God I can't believe that fish
  is good at swimming but then we don't notice that we're basically like gracefully
  gliding and Teeter tottering all over the world and the way that we control that
  is sort of Highly complex from both a sort of physical perspective and also from
  a Balan perspective or like a neural perspective great um let's call this uh balance
  control and so where are we on time 1255 someday I won't talk the entire time I
  promise uh yeah so I'll just say it out loud there's a concept called the base of
  support it's exactly what you think it is there's also a concept called the center
  of mass it's roughly what you think it is the if the base of support is if the B
  if the center of mass is above the base of support we're good if it goes outside
  we fall over if we're so static equilibrium doing great oh my God I'm falling it's
  okay I have two feet I do this all the time this is called walking I'm going from
  point A to point B every following is pretty high complex stuff great Okay so one
  of the things my body's really good at is that and I'm very good at just standing
  and keeping upright and I tend not to fall over especially if I'm not doing anything
  interesting I can make it harder and do this my Bas of support just got way smaller
  it's a little harder I feel my body working at it but again I've been here before
  I can do this not all day but I can do it for a while great that's good um yeah
  so I'll start in an a pose also it doesn't record sound so I can just talk while
  I'm doing it uh yeah start with a pose thank you um and keep an ey on the time let
  me know if it goes over a minute just say minute all right and now we're recording
  look at me I'm doing it I'm standing here but I don't just have to stand in here
  I can also lean I can lean pretty far forward I can lean all the way to the right
  I can lean all the way to the left and my I know when to stop my body just kind
  of like stops and there's this certain Sensation that I have I can't go any farther
  uh because my center of Mass is at limit of my base of support my arms are a part
  of that if I go forward I can't I have to lean my butt back the whole thing great
  um now I'm doing one foot this is harder but I'm doing it look at me go and I can
  jump wow I did all that how we doing on time 10 seconds look at me go great T okay
  that's probably good it looks much more impressive when it's in the when it's data
  uh did you turn that thing off nice okay I weigh roughly speaking one body mass
  give or take and when I'm controlling my body sort of throwing arrows into the ground
  in order to like push the meat in the desired Direction I put the arrow in the opposite
  way that I want to go I'm putting those forces into the ground appropriately for
  the mass now if you wanted to compare me to something saying that I weigh one body
  mass is not particularly helpful uh so if you wanted to compare me to some external
  reference I weigh roughly 95 lers of water which is the same thing as 95 kilograms
  because metric is cool like that this am Michael bring this over look at you so
  Aaron did a farmer carry of this object across campus um this weighs 45 lbs so you
  can convert that was that like 20-ish kilograms which is like a fifth of my body
  weight but look at me standing I have not even fallen over how in God's name am
  I able to do that with difficulty and possible injury but yeah so we're do kind
  of a similar thing probably less jumping uh if I die on camera analyze the data
  you want call uh balance kettlebell KB or kettlebell okay so I'm going to start
  in the a pose then I'm going to pick up the who's it 1 1,00 2 1,00 3 1000 and now
  here I am standing what do you think this data looks like relative to the other
  data so I'm going all the way over here to this side again and I'm going to go all
  the way over there to that side I'm all the way forward backwards I don't know if
  this going to track the system doesn't track kettle bells just to be clear it only
  tracks human bodies or human body-shaped objects God Jesus  okay that's Jesus okay
  there we go so before if we're measuring Center of mass relative to base of support
  and we do that again here is what what's it going to look like what's that answer
  going to look like especially considering that we're not measuring the kettle bell
  we're just measuring the body me Jesus okay good the things I do oo what's that
  data going to look like so we can ask the question qualitatively what's it going
  to look like like it's going to be this shifted no there wow we can ask the question
  quantitatively which has numbers in it you start with a qualitative estimate and
  then you measure the quantitative thing and if they don't line up something went
  wrong either in your measurement or in your Intuition or both okay so I we roughly
  one body mass multiply that by one g that's one body weight so I'm now pushing down
  on the ground with one body weight of force the arrow that's pointing into the Earth
  is the same that it's thing so I'm M that's a kilogram uh G is m/ second squared
  so if you accept you move so yeah meter if you move it over time and it goes it
  was here and then 1 second later it's there that's 1 meter per second if it this
  is 1 m/ second and then 1 second later it goes 2 m then it's accelerating at two
  1 m/ second per second so 1 meter per second great 1 meter per second per second
  great we can combine these apparently and get 1 m/s squared wow and then if we multiply
  a kilogram by a meter second squared you get a Newton which is the name for that
  great easy don't worry about it the machine knows how to do that so you don't have
  to the important thing is that I weigh one and my weight is also one just divide
  this all by numbers I don't actually care how waterways so if I'm standing here
  I'm putting Force into the ground that's the same as how much I weigh if I'm doing
  this posture there's some weird stuff going on in my joints we don't have to worry
  about that now I can put more Force into the ground than I weigh and if I do what
  will happen I go into the Earth I go to the side where will I go amazing spectacular
  yeah that's called jumping and basically what that means is for a period of time
  I put more Force into the ground then I we so I was periodically freed from the
  tyranny of Earth but then it comes back and grabs me and if you measured it it would
  be what what this was but with better handwriting I'm going to a pose I'll do a
  big jump I'll do 10 small jumps I'll try to do another big jump and then I'll try
  to jump on one foot and then if I'm not dead we can call it there okay God damn
  it okay okay 1 1,00 2 1,00 3 1,00 1 2 3 4 five 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 oh that's too many
  okay God damn it one 2 three four five 6 7 8 9 10 two three four five six seven
  eight nine 10  one of the rules of being a professor is if you want underg think
  you're cool just say in front of them just like one time but I say it a lot so you'll
  be all right okay uh I guess let that one ride or just yeah ah okay uh could you
  pull up the terminal again is that good is it is it is it running or do you have
  to tell it to I have to okay yeah so those are the videos there are three of them
  um and now it will do a lot of math and as these things scroll by um some of this
  yeah this is this is a guy doing the math uh 7% and this is all stacked up so this
  is all three processing at once the amount of human labor boiled into this little
  pink line is tremendous there's like human labor from me from Aaron from other people
  from like people using the software around the world but like that's nothing compared
  to all the other stuff cuz I didn't invent computers I didn't write like the the
  amount of code that goes into this where code is just math written in English uh
  is mostly spent like importing other people's packages like you import numpy and
  then you get to do linear algebra you you install Python and then you get to write
  stuff that looks like this and as you do like and it's so code is just text files
  it's that live on your computer and they get converted into binary and that crunches
  numbers and blah blah blah um and it winds up comprising like gigabytes of text
  files go into writing the the numbers that are being crunched on this thing and
  that is work that's being that was done by people over the past let's say 40 to
  50 years arguably back to I mean you got Claude Shannon making basically writing
  down information Theory and then you got uh what's his name blle Park guy um Turing
  Allen Turing back in the 50s and you got like ad love lace going back to alisi who
  was a Iraqi um guy who invented the algorithm um back to Babylonians crunching numbers
  um and it all kind of goes together and luckily for us unlike the that made the
  motion capture system everybody that wrote the code that went into this pink line
  shared it they allowed other people to use it and they allowed their effort to make
  the world a generally better place where any human can do more things than they
  could have done before that person did that work the other alternative the standard
  practice and most of the software that you lose you use in your life is to do a
  bunch of work based off an understanding and a knowledge and a capacity that you
  have greater than the people around you then once you've made something useful exploit
  the disparity that you have created to extract resources from the people around
  you I don't like that option as a person anyways so what that was doing it was crunch
  so the pink line is really where most of the work was happening the white line is
  doing the simpler triangulation stuff the pink line is where we are trying to extract
  skeletons from rectangles of light and this is where we are triangulating comparing
  the two dimensional estimates because cameras get 2D View and have that marker camera
  camera person triangulation see how that works wow if you decided to point a laser
  at me and then you also pointed a laser me and then you told each other where you
  were sitting and what angle you were pointing the laser and as long as you both
  confirmed that it was like overlapping here you could do the math to figure out
  what the distance is even though you have no idea how far your laser is actually
  going conceptually make sense qualitative understanding I promise you the part where
  you know the math is not relevant to that Baseline understanding great so we did
  the 2D stuff we looked at the rectangle of of pixels and we did the this is the
  the part where it draws the Skeleton on top I guess you probably haven't see much
  of that data yet so I'll show it to you in a second remember what all this stuff
  is oh you might need to run it again oh never mind I lied so that part is where
  it gets shoved into blender uh did you all download blender a thing so blender is
  a free open source animation software again made for free and given to you the world
  as a gift freely given and it's made for animators and artists and people like that
  who are artists who specifically tra in the world of uh creating extremely precise
  3D renderings of hypothetical worlds um is it still working oh it's thinking Yeah
  Yeah so basically yeah cool so we take there we go here I'll drive thank you you
  want see uh yeah okay behold je come on check it out it's the world you live in
  sort of oh I'm so Le having a mouse yeah oh oh there we go so that's Skelly and
  we ah oh I guess I kept going I have to figure out how to rotate alt there we go
  so not as high because I'm tired so this thing right here woo calm down that is
  my center of mass such as it is and if I do that I say in range I say round frame
  I say plus or minus 30 30 no 30 30 uh calculate uh yes haha oh and then I say uh
  don't show the frame numbers make it red no don't show the frame numbers look at
  it go so if you look so here I am standing man standing look at this rectangle of
  pixels and then look at this unbelievable gob smacky magic of being able to draw
  a DOT on my left shoulder and it's kind of correct this is the part that's kind
  of AI it's not I this is machine learning uses convolutional neural networks it's
  roughly the same math as what's the bot when you're talking to it but it's for pictures
  somehow don't worry about it this is the magical step this is the part that like
  shouldn't be possible it's also the part that's the hardest to like um understand
  from the outside the trigonometry and linear algebra stuff I do that all day I can
  know that it's right when I do it this one I can't luckily this weird magic step
  draws a skeleton on top of a picture of a person and I happen to have roughly 12
  billion years of evolution that lets me be real good at telling you where the picture
  of the person is in the image so I can look at it and say yeah that's right that's
  working pretty good so that's very important that the only magical step in this
  pipeline is the part that you can confirm with your eyeball qualitatively and if
  you want to quantitatively understand if it's actually measured anything good you
  have to get like a PhD that's like literally what he's doing is like validating
  it beyond the gut check is like that's pretty good but if you want real numbers
  it's like a lot of work and then who how are we doing on time we're doing okay so
  now that's a silly skeleton um okay do that do that we say graph editor then we
  click on this guy again hey hey and then we say normalize and then oh and then we
  say I will data look at me go uh this tool this so blender is not a scientific tool
  it was not made to be a scientific tool I am abusing it into being a scientific
  tool uh and it's it is grateful for the experience um select grab grab ha so this
  is a complicated thing it's got ribs it's got a pelvis it's got this skull all these
  parts have weird shapes I didn't actually measure these things I didn't measure
  where the hips were I didn't measure much of anything uh I only measured these little
  dotos here and even that's pretty abstract and we're making inferences about what
  the more complicated shapes were doing by tracking those dots because we are going
  to pretend that things like pelvises and the associated meat are rigid bodies and
  because they are rigid bodies you only need to track a couple of points on them
  to know what the other ones are doing wobbly bodies don't have that property rigid
  bodies do so we like rigid bodies this skeleton is kind of aesthetic we can also
  look at huh these little stick o these sticks are the actual rigid bodies that we
  are inferring as the thing that connects the actual dots or the dots are the the
  3D positions that are triangulated from the things in the image so we we measured
  some rectangles of light we inferred some stick figures in 2D we constructed some
  Doos in 3D we put sticks on and we put a skeleton on them and now it's doing all
  this weird stuff but I got to be honest that's still pretty complicated it's got
  things like joints those joints have angles I don't want to have to deal with any
  of that so what we're going to do just going to take all of these things ah and
  shift all you guys not you hide you see control anyways let's see get you hide don't
  do that no who cares anyways yeah this cuz this is the trajectory of the whole body
  I don't want to analyze that I so luckily we can boil this whole guy down into just
  this and we can look at things like so I want to know what my like we talked about
  like putting those arrows into the ground in order to like launch ourselves off
  the floor if we're into that type of thing how how hard did I push off of the ground
  like how much force did I put into the ground when I did that jump I forgot the
  force plate and unfortunately that moment is gone forever right lost into the past
  all we have is the measurements that we had and those measurements are kind of these
  impoverished web Camy who's itss very abstract and I want to know how hard I pushed
  right I I care about that for some reason luckily physics is pretty rigid and I
  can make a lot of estimates about what was going on at some approximation by just
  looking at this weird shape because one of the interesting things about complicated
  bodies is no matter how complicated you are if I put you in a catapult I can predict
  your location very directly doesn't matter how complicated it is is it follows the
  same rules in the air um so even though I can't tell you what each knee was doing
  from this type of measurement I can't tell you what my hips and stuff were doing
  I can tell you in a broad stroke how many newtons my body is going to have to absorb
  when it gets from this point down to that point Boo and then you can also show I
  don't know if this is real real data if you really squint and believe me there's
  a little bit of a cuz I'm it's a lot of meat I got to throw around and I'll bet
  if you measured this it would be somehow worse than this what's worse hard to know
  we also know uh so now I'm doing this on my the ground I now so before I don't know
  which knee is doing what now I do because I've constrained the behavior to be easier
  to measure I can also see I'm kind of like bouncing around like I'm not staying
  in one place there's some control Loop that's happening I'm I'm guiding something
  there's something that's being steered whatever that thing is it's probably it feels
  like it should be related to whoever it was that lets me do this right seems like
  it should maybe maybe not this one's in my arm that one's in my leg this one's static
  that one's moving it's hard to know I couldn't really I could get this data in the
  big fancy lab but it would honestly be difficult it's not made for this type of
  stuff um you to put the full body on I couldn't have gotten that much data while
  standing in front of a classroom both because there's no cameras on the walls here
  and also just because it takes longer than that and I certainly couldn't have shown
  you how to do it because even if I could requisite aspect of that is start with
  a quarter million dollars that you're going to spend to record people whereas now
  it's spend 20 bucks on some webcams and figure out how to run stuff from command
  line you have to type and then push enter and that's the class so uh thank you for
  watching and um between now and next week somebody it's unclear who is going to
  take this data and kind of package it up and put it somewhere online that you can
  watch it and use it you might not then next week we'll get into like actually how
  to open the things look at the data and uh there's going to be an assignment for
  this week which is basically like talk to the bot about what the hell that was all
  about because every one of you watched every one of you saw something different
  when I did all that stuff and I am very curious about what comes out when you talk
  about it to the rectangle that is so friendly and polite okay thank you now we have
  10 minutes to break down before someone gets mad at us question I sent you an email
  that saw I probably not okay is that like a good method to no uh I I just get so
  much email so you can absolutely send email but if I'll probably miss it shoot me
  a message on Discord it's the easiest way I didn't know if Discord is like too like
  informal it a little bit is um but like for the first message I was like I'm gonna
  be safe that's Wise Wise uh what was the question and also if if if I if it's important
  just send it again okay U I was just wondering about the ATT policy um if I like
  had to miss a class or like Thanksgiving break um is there like a zoom option no
  you're out sorry I e e e for

  text: hello we're recording now spectacular but that's not I mean so yeah fmri is
    great kind of uh I have doubts but um it is like the best tool that we have for
    looking inside of a person's brain without opening it up um there's also things
    like EEG there's also stuff like f near I don't really like or trust any of those
    either because they're all just so abstracted away from the thing that we actually
    hypothetically care about which is the desum desum desat Des of the kind of research
    that's multiple yeah um the desideratum of a given research area is the thing
    that you want to know why' you come here why' you show up what's your goal that
    is the desideratum of the field of inquiry and I would argue that the field of
    Neuroscience is largely designed to help us understand what the hell this is like
    this this stuff right I left my house got on a bike did a bunch of this somehow
    my dinner from last night fueled the energy cost somehow and now I'm here and
    I'm talking to you and I'm telling you that that happened um and a lot of the
    scientific world that we live in this sort of has this very reductionist feel
    and sort of underlying philosophy of reductionism where the goal is to measure
    things with increasing Precision at the at finer and finer levels with the hopes
    that we'll someday get to the bottom of it and figure it all out um and so because
    of that it's kind of somewhat by necessity of technology and somewhat by you know
    sort of feedback loops driven there um the tools that we use to measure research
    often come at the cost of the ecological validity of the data meaning that you're
    putting me in a tube and shooting big magnets at my head and saying oh look at
    what your brain is doing that tells me something about you out in the world um
    over evolutionary time and over you know course of your day and it does to some
    extent because you're measuring the same engine that's driving the behavior when
    I'm out doing stuff but this you're getting a very precise measurement of the
    thing doing something different from the thing that you actually care about which
    is behaving out in the real world right so it's kind of there's often a trade-off
    in fact there's perhaps necessarily A trade-off between empirical precision and
    God in heaven and ecological validity

  text: one second I got this so if we can't record what's going on in my brain because
    it's unfortunately 2024 and we just can't do that yet and some people will say
    oh no you can put e EEG on people uh you can do fmri on people and it's like yeah
    you can but I don't but yeah let me phrase that no you can't but a lot of people
    believe that you can and we respect their efforts um so if we are talking about
    trade-offs between like empirical precision and ecological validity anytime there's
    a trade-off there's often two sides to that so I'd say all the way on the farthest
    side of like empirical Precision um reductionist philosophy is the eiz measurements
    that's like you're sticking a a electrode into the the goop itself and looking
    at how it spikes and you get unbelievably precise measurements typically on nonhuman
    animals but sometimes you get to do that um but in those situations in particular
    the animal or whatever that you're well it's always an animal um human or non-human
    animal is never doing anything particularly interesting it's just usually attached
    to something because the technology requires it there are new technologies coming
    online that allow animals to move around as they're being measured but and I'm
    like working on some of those things with some people but those are new types
    of studies new types of tools new types of equipment an alternative approach is
    to say let's go the other way and let's just measure the behavior as closely as
    we can to the desired the desideratum the sort of the case study the ecologically
    valid measurements uh the ecologically valid behaviors let's record those as well
    as we can and then we can make inferences about what's going on and the inner
    parts the hidden variables the parts that we can't actually measure directly and
    if we're lucky then the people who are out there cracking open skulls and taking
    like electrical recordings we'll share their notes and we can and they can say
    oh hey we found this part and that part and we think this does this other thing
    and I can say oh well I saw this behavior and that behavior and those two things
    kind of line up these things don't but those things do and in a perfect world
    we all get to do nice good happy research end of class we're done um but yeah
    no unfortunately it's actually slightly more complicated than that um

  text: yeah so let's sort of for the moment put the reductionists to the side there's
    more than enough of them they're very well funded they'll be fine and let's work
    on this other part where we try to figure out so that that thing I said before
    where I was like you just measure the real behavior and then you study that and
    you're good to go it turns out that part also quite difficult and you saw in that
    lab some of the big fancy tools that we use to do that and it measures the environmental
    forces excuse me for pushing into your space um yeah so we can measure things
    like Movement we can measure things like forces we use these big fancy tools to
    do it actually uh you want to help me out but yeah guess yeah just go ahead and
    start setting things up just freeo cap it regular and I'll keep blathering about
    stuff do you have on here yeah no I got it cond activate that's why I was late
    I was like oh it's been a while since I've used that computer to do anything ah
    and I'm gonna move this up do we know how to raise that thing it's probably over
    here cam privacy manual control I don't see anything obvious oh it might be stupid
    and just well unlikely but it might be like pull it down when it comes up oh maybe
    it's got the thing on it no it's probably powered um it might be like it turns
    it off when this thing turns off uh it's fine we'll figure it out that's good
    enough for no oh uh yeah and also turn this off yeah so this is connected but
    because it's being it's being held by OBS these things turn off so there's an
    order of operations that you have to do if it's like if you if you turn OBS on
    and it grabs that camera then you can do free mo cap and it only sees these otherwise
    it gets weird Okay so as I mentioned I spent a lot of my time over the past half
    decade or so uh messing with cheap cameras because I

  text: had a whole crisis of conscience around how freaking expensive that lab was
    and even if I wasn't like morally perturbed by it I hate that equipment it's garbage
    that software is the worst like as in terms of like physical measurement apparati
    spectacular the force plates are great the cameras are very fast and precise but
    the software is abysmal and it's super duper duper expensive um and even if it
    wasn't it like sucks to use and there's a lot of manual effort manual labor it's
    basically 90s Tech um which I haven't been doing this since the 9s but I have
    been doing this since that was less of a dig um and yeah so cool nice so also
    there's been a lot of technological advancement since the 90s uh and a lot of
    them has focused on these weird objects this is called camera cameras measure
    light uh light is trying to get a sense of color I might have to take my shoes
    off because they're yeah I'll take I'll do it later um oh yeah right so basically
    uh long story short so this is free moap it's a free open source markless motion
    capture system that works in conceptually very similar way to the big fancy space
    in the lab um did you guys see that they show you like the 2D views with the intensi
    you see like you move the thing around it's like oh look at those dots on the
    on the screen and then they get triangulated remember because they triangles it's
    mostly triangles um uh and then you get the 3D information based off of that so
    those old systems I say old like say the traditional marker based motion capture
    system basically constrains the world that it's measuring to make it easier to
    measure you take a you put a marker like a DOT specially designed dot that uses
    retrolective stuff which is the the things on your shoes which have interesting
    Optical properties um and you put those on the person on the thing that you're
    trying to measure and that thing is designed to work with the cameras to make
    the cameras able to track that thing in 2D and then there's a bunch of fancy secret
    expensive software doing 20 thou 20 uh like 2 to 3,000-year Old math um to figure
    out where that dot is in space um um so again you kind of have that theme

  text: where you're constraining the world a bit to make it easier to measure in
    the fmri or in the eiz world you can strain the behavior by telling the person
    not to move you constrain the behavior by like removing the skull from the thing
    that's getting in the because the little electrodes are wimpy um but you're you're
    changing the thing that you're measuring in order to make it easier to measure
    meure by necessity because of the because of the um that's probably good uh and
    there's typically kind of like a tradeoff there like as a general rule the more
    you constrain the environment that you're measuring the easier it is to measure
    because you are exerting your like you're looking at the thing and you're saying
    I'm going to make this easier for myself and that typically works if you're good
    at what you're doing but you also wind up affecting the thing that you're trying
    to measure and that may or may not matter for the desert orom of the research
    that you're trying to do um so for example if I was trying to like to do the traditional
    map thing I have to bring people into the lab so that's its own kind of difficulty
    um I have to put them in the spandex suit I have to put the dots on them I have
    to Cali the room you know all these things may or may not matter um but I had
    to do that for a long time because that was the only way to get a camera to track
    an object in two dimensions and nowadays we have other ways of doing that so I'm
    going to go through a bit of a process right now and in what will be a recurring
    theme uh just going to move this over there so I don't trip on it and kill myself
    this is going to be one of those things where um it's going to make more sense
    later what's happening uh because ideally if it all works out we're going to use
    this data for the rest of the semester and sort of look at it and try to understand
    what's going on and try to sort of get a sense of how we can use measurements
    of what happened in the past to make inferences about what may or may not be going
    on in the meat in the goop on the basis of the measurements we manag to get uh
    because I'm going to go out here in a second it's going to take I'm not like that
    but um there's a whole process I guess we can turn off the projector when it's
    ready to go or we can turn it to that it probably won't pick

  text: up yeah um yeah could you maybe just tune it so it yeah that one might need
    want to go like behind those desks or something um yeah because one of the realities
    is that if I wanted to know about what let's say it was Michael who was moving
    the triangle around and I wanted to know something about what like what were the
    motor commands that were going to his muscle parts um my ability to answer that
    question is dependent on what I managed to record like the true fact answer of
    that question of what were the motor commands that were sent the that information
    is dead and gone fuzzed off into the past it went to the same place that the dot
    data went after you didn't record it and you can never get it back it dissolves
    into the foam of whatever happens when time goes forward um and so what that means
    is that the actual moment of recording is very very important this is the moment
    all this data is going away um but because we're not recording it because I didn't
    click the big red button but when I do that will be the only record that we have
    of whatever was going on and we're going to try to use it to understand what was
    going on in this weird goopy thing there are two the two weirdest things in the
    universe are light and human behavior and we're going to try to use the one to
    understand the other basically impossible but we can approximate it iteratively
    over time okay let's see yeah could you like tilt them down and Center this one
    yeah just a little bit less height sorry thank you and yeah that's right okay
    right I forgot like angles matter here and uh try to get it like straight like
    this straight if you can yeah so this is because this is the part you can't do
    again except that you can you can do it again I can just record myself twice um
    but this is the moment of transduction transduction is a great word that means
    when energy changes from one form to another uh in this particular case

  text: light is going through the lens bending hitting a sensor which is a weird
    rectangle and being transformed into a pattern of electrical impulses if that
    sounds familiar it's because that's what you are that's what you do at least in
    this rough region your eyes are not cameras but there are similarities at some
    level and so yeah so we're going to be measuring rectangles of light we're going
    to be measuring three rectangles of light taking samples from three light cones
    from Three locations and we're going to be pulling one measurement of light intensity
    at three wavelengths r g and B red green and blue uh 30 times per second from
    three three devices um actually we don't the device's loccation unfortunately
    we can we're going to try to guess later by cheating and measuring something that
    we know what the answer is this is called calibration and then we're going to
    guess what the location of those devices were and then we're going to look at
    the rectangles of colors we're going to call them colors even though it's pretty
    abstract um and then try to go from there down some strange epistemic path with
    various forms of computation in math most of which you will not have to worry
    about because it'll all happen very quickly um and then try to make inferences
    about what brains do central nervous systems really cool yeah thanks what's that
    want meay here buttons or yeah uh yeah yeah um I guess I'll I'll calibrate first
    and then I'll sort of make a plan um f8 looking there uh all right shoes are coming
    off I apologize but this will not be the last time I'm taking my shoes off cuz
    my shoes are black and my socks are white and the ground is dark and we care about
    where my feet are so we're measuring light remember like we're not measuring feet
    we're measuring light and then we're inferring feet so we're going to make our
    job a little bit easier by putting these things there if I cared about the grippiness
    of these shoes I would that would this would be a mistake in terms of this experiment
    but I don't don't care about the grippiness of shoes so

  text: this manipulation of reality I think is forgivable okay there now it's always
    the feet and okay so if you recall we're going to measure we're going to record
    stuff from cameras right there's subtle hints in the environment that that's what's
    going to happen you're going to this guy follows me if I ask him to nice good
    job that's a two axis gimbal you have a three AIS gimbal we have two of them right
    here we'll talk about that later uh so we're going to be recording from the cameras
    cameras measure light we talked about that we're going to want to know where the
    cameras are that's going to be pretty important CU we're going to be trying to
    measure space uh and so we're going to so we're going to do a a thing we call
    calibration which is basically a fancy word for trying to measure where all the
    cameras are relative to each other so the way that we do that is we cheat because
    later we're going to record something that's a weird unknown goopy wobbly object
    one of these and that thing is going to be really hard to measure and so the first
    thing we want to do is confirm to our ourselves that the tool is actually doing
    what we think it's doing and so we're going to cheat by measuring something where
    we know the answer to the question this is a grid see all the squares it's the
    the squares are 58 mm on a side you can see I wrote that right there obviously
    you can see that from the back and it's got these little patterns here that are
    custom made to be easy to track by cameras so we're going to start by showing
    a camera is this friendly calibration object and then they're going to use that
    and sort of infer well based off math that a combination of me and tens of thousands
    of my closest friends wrote over the past 30 to 40 years or so based off math
    that's we've been doing for thousands of years um and the result of that will
    be an estimate about the location of each camera measured in uh six it's the six
    degree of Freedom estimate of where the cameras are six degrees of freedom means
    that there's six numbers involved three positions XYZ and three rotations XY Z
    with position and rotation you can measure the location and rotation of a rigid
    body in space but don't worry about that it won't be on the test there won't be
    a test you'll just just let it wash over you okay um yeah like there's a a spot

    won't do that um okay so once they calibrate them you and you don't touch that
    camera you don't touch that camera nobody touch any cameras deal great because
    if you do I'll have to do this again okay um I guess it's not I don't know about
    how yeah you want to I guess we have another Spotlight too yeah I don't know is

    let's don't eat that here I'm going to write out stuff that we're going to do
    just basically just like feed the cable as far as it'll go the last time I recorded
    data in class it became the test data for this project for like two years so I'm
    not saying that's what we're going to do now but I have learned over the course
    of my life that oh there's no plug over here either how does anybody plug anything

    have anything that has a record button when you push record your cognitive facilities
    go so you need to do everything you can to externalize thoughts before you push
    the record button um so just kind of taken that time yeah that's good thank you
    okay light is very important for cameras um that one isn't going to have any oh
    I guess I can just get closer oh okay yeah I was confused because they're in a
    different order on that screen um okay go ahead and cool so now I am basically
    just showing the board to all of the cameras and the most important thing here
    is that each of the cameras has friends that there are uh sufficient frames where
    each camera can see the board along with one of its compatriots um shared views
    probably good and wish I could turn the projector on and off but it's slow so
    I guess we'll see see now I know how to do it

  text: oh see other professors just show up and like give PowerPoints that's like
    I don't know how to do that um could you pull up the terminal so okay so it's
    thinking and what it's doing here is can you like Control Plus IG it does it work
    no well anyways if you so basically this is like just readouts of like what it's
    doing under the hood and it's basically just doing a bunch of geometry and right
    now this number here we probably can't read it says 8.95 that is the number of
    frames that were recorded from all of the cameras uh there's two things to worry
    about time and space time we handle through synchronization and there's a bunch
    of many gallons of my life poured into making sure that this thing records frames
    from each camera synchronously like it within it's a 30fps camera which means
    it every frame you get a new frame every 33 milliseconds I use frame interchangeably
    with image um because of like the history of Cinema I guess but so we have 895
    synchronized frames from each camera and that synchronization is sort of how we
    do the time synchrony if I compared the frame that happened at T time equals 12
    from this one and compared that to the one that this one got at time equals 13
    I can't use those to figure out where the thing I'm measuring is because that's
    you know they'll get different times so we do okay this is where we tell when
    this third one finishes it will either fail or not fail and we'll find out together
    um yeah so you have synchronization between you get synchronized measurements
    from Three locations three locations which are not moving that's important this
    guy would not be a good tool camera because it moves so I could do the calibration
    thing but then I would it would move around and then I can't get good measurements
    um we're good anyone here done any like optimization stuff and would touch that
    in your life people heard the term optimization like weird math um this is doing
    optimization right now to figure out basically use the measure measurements that
    we got to figure out where each camera was in space and it

    you can do that in there think I think just double click that yeah okay so this
    is where the cameras presumably are camera zero 1 and two because we start counting
    from zero because we someone decided that was a good idea uh Matrix size is that
    that's the pixels so we're it's a low resolution image but that's okay uh rotation
    so this is camera zero so the translation translation is like moving so basically
    it's position um translation from the origin 0 because it's camera 0 great uh
    this one's camera 1 it's - 2719 516 these are millimeters so roughly 2.7 M away
    if this said 20,000 I'd be like oh  something messed up but I don't know if it
    I don't know if this is right but it gut check scale is that it's close to enough
    so that's we we like that and then this one down here 1160 so it looks like the
    order is 0 1 2 is that right doesn't really matter is that right oh and also there's
    these other guys which matter a lot and then these rotation variables those are
    Oiler angles um when you see it written down it's spelled e u l e r and youd probably
    think ooler uler and then you hear people say oer those are the same guy so FYI
    um XYZ rotation so this is the x axis this is the y axis this is the z- axis rotation
    around X rotation around y rotation around Z these are radians I trust that that's
    where those cameras live great so we we have an estimate of where the cameras
    are um now we can try to measure more interesting Behavior Uh yeah I guess turn
    it off how did I do it was there oh no my hubris H the back is the answer we'll
    see okay so I'm Huck Finning my pants so that more of my body will be visible

    open so if I were to we down here it's harder to tell what my knee is doing right
    it's harder for you as a human to do it so it would definitely be harder for a
    rectangle silicone to do it silicon whatever um okay so let's just do let's do
    four separate recordings so we'll call the first one Ro and then the second one
    uh balance control second uh third one balance kettle bell and then jumping so
    yeah nice at start uh yes where and I need yeah a pose a pose a pose a pose it
    helps me uh because okay so yeah so I'm going to we're going to take four recordings
    and the first one's kind of like again kind of calibration I'm going to be doing
    kind of like boring stuff like simple control standing stuff just to sort of make
    sure things look right in later stuff because in these later ones are going to
    be moving more and doing more interesting stuff so start with something simple
    so we're going to start with an a pose which is T pose we've heard of that it
    was like a joke for a while this is the uh this happens because under the hood
    and all your favorite animation things it's it's these guys and if you set all
    the joint angles to zero it's that so whenever the code up under the hood and
    the data becomes Unbound to the Model T pose so that's why that happens um T pose
    a pose because get it because of um we tend to do an A Pose in this world because
    it takes up less space and uh oh right yeah um I'm going to put this like here
    try get it just like give me a sense of where to

    oh well you should have stopped me what's no no I never said bet that's called
    gaslighting very effective uh it's good to like practice recognizing that because
    just shows up uh okay what are we doing in class who are you people Jesus Christ
    uh the top one okay helpful see it's really helpful to have like an externalized
    nervous system to handle certain tasks and a pose standing range of motion I'll
    just count it off okay can you swing like you're do with range motion h oh well
    so this one oh I see yeah right backwards you guys can't see that unfortunately
    but it looks like this but but three of them okay uh yes okay 1 1,00 2 1,00 3
    1,00 4 1,00 5 1,000 and I guess I'm still standing I think yeah standing is fine
    um range of motion so this is the top one then we got these ones and we got those
    ones they only go one way got these wrist got hands which which is cool uh got
    a waist which is neat we got one leg that goes like this we got another leg that
    goes like that uh if I missed anything that'll definitely get it okay good um
    we should I wish we had told it not to Auto process because then we could keep
    recording shut it down let it let it finish synchronizing first yeah let it finish
    synchronizing then Loop it through yeah so from that we're going to be able to
    measure the first thing is going to be the the well this happens every recording
    but the first one's kind of a simpler one um we will get the length of the rigid
    bodies so I tried to go

    their full range of motion um and if we wanted to use that later actually don't
    have any pipelines that really use that data but useful to look at um and now
    we're restarting it to get another one because we forgot to click the button that
    says Don't Auto process just so had yeah I was so close to using like the new
    trying to use the new one for this class but that seemed like a bad idea uh freeo
    cap en dash EnV yeah um yes so the next Parts we're going to look are going to
    be about posture and balance and standing and balance and whatnot so it's weird
    as hell that we're bipeds first thing it's wild move to just use two little feet
    it's pretty much it's us Birds angry bears and kangaroos at a full hop are the
    only guys that really stand on two feet um there's a long weird story about how
    we got here long story short we used to be basically squirrels lived in the trees
    so we were doing this on the branches and then someday we were like let's stand
    up and go over there and the rest the rest is history got way complicated after
    that but bold move um so this is one of those things where like we look animals
    do stuff and we're like oh my God I can't believe that fish is good at swimming
    but then we don't notice that we're basically like gracefully gliding and Teeter
    tottering all over the world and the way that we control that is sort of Highly
    complex from both a sort of physical perspective and also from a Balan perspective
    or like a neural perspective great um let's call this uh balance control and so
    where are we on time 1255 someday I won't talk the entire time I promise uh yeah
    so I'll just say it out loud there's a concept called the base of support it's
    exactly what you think it is there's also a concept called the center of mass
    it's roughly what you think it is the if the base of support

  text: is if the B if the center of mass is above the base of support we're good
    if it goes outside we fall over if we're so static equilibrium doing great oh
    my God I'm falling it's okay I have two feet I do this all the time this is called
    walking I'm going from point A to point B every following is pretty high complex
    stuff great Okay so one of the things my body's really good at is that and I'm
    very good at just standing and keeping upright and I tend not to fall over especially
    if I'm not doing anything interesting I can make it harder and do this my Bas
    of support just got way smaller it's a little harder I feel my body working at
    it but again I've been here before I can do this not all day but I can do it for
    a while great that's good um yeah so I'll start in an a pose also it doesn't record
    sound so I can just talk while I'm doing it uh yeah start with a pose thank you
    um and keep an ey on the time let me know if it goes over a minute just say minute
    all right and now we're recording look at me I'm doing it I'm standing here but
    I don't just have to stand in here I can also lean I can lean pretty far forward
    I can lean all the way to the right I can lean all the way to the left and my
    I know when to stop my body just kind of like stops and there's this certain Sensation
    that I have I can't go any farther uh because my center of Mass is at limit of
    my base of support my arms are a part of that if I go forward I can't I have to
    lean my butt back the whole thing great um now I'm doing one foot this is harder
    but I'm doing it look at me go and I can jump wow I did all that how we doing
    on time 10 seconds look at me go great T okay that's probably good it looks much
    more impressive when it's in the when it's data uh did you turn that thing off
    nice okay I weigh roughly speaking one body mass give or take and when I'm controlling
    my body sort of throwing arrows into the ground in order to like push the meat
    in the desired Direction I put the arrow in the opposite way that I want to go
    I'm putting those forces into the ground appropriately for the mass now if you
    wanted to compare me to something saying that I weigh one body mass is not

  text: particularly helpful uh so if you wanted to compare me to some external reference
    I weigh roughly 95 lers of water which is the same thing as 95 kilograms because
    metric is cool like that this am Michael bring this over look at you so Aaron
    did a farmer carry of this object across campus um this weighs 45 lbs so you can
    convert that was that like 20-ish kilograms which is like a fifth of my body weight
    but look at me standing I have not even fallen over how in God's name am I able
    to do that with difficulty and possible injury but yeah so we're do kind of a
    similar thing probably less jumping uh if I die on camera analyze the data you
    want call uh balance kettlebell KB or kettlebell okay so I'm going to start in
    the a pose then I'm going to pick up the who's it 1 1,00 2 1,00 3 1000 and now
    here I am standing what do you think this data looks like relative to the other
    data so I'm going all the way over here to this side again and I'm going to go
    all the way over there to that side I'm all the way forward backwards I don't
    know if this going to track the system doesn't track kettle bells just to be clear
    it only tracks human bodies or human body-shaped objects God Jesus  okay that's
    Jesus okay there we go so before if we're measuring Center of mass relative to
    base of support and we do that again here is what what's it going to look like
    what's that answer going to look like especially considering that we're not measuring
    the kettle bell we're just measuring the body me Jesus okay good the things I
    do oo what's that data going to look like so we can ask the question qualitatively
    what's it going to look like like it's going to be this shifted no there wow we
    can ask the question quantitatively which has numbers in it you start with a qualitative
    estimate and then you measure the quantitative thing and if they don't line up

  text: something went wrong either in your measurement or in your Intuition or both
    okay so I we roughly one body mass multiply that by one g that's one body weight
    so I'm now pushing down on the ground with one body weight of force the arrow
    that's pointing into the Earth is the same that it's thing so I'm M that's a kilogram
    uh G is m/ second squared so if you accept you move so yeah meter if you move
    it over time and it goes it was here and then 1 second later it's there that's
    1 meter per second if it this is 1 m/ second and then 1 second later it goes 2
    m then it's accelerating at two 1 m/ second per second so 1 meter per second great
    1 meter per second per second great we can combine these apparently and get 1
    m/s squared wow and then if we multiply a kilogram by a meter second squared you
    get a Newton which is the name for that great easy don't worry about it the machine
    knows how to do that so you don't have to the important thing is that I weigh
    one and my weight is also one just divide this all by numbers I don't actually
    care how waterways so if I'm standing here I'm putting Force into the ground that's
    the same as how much I weigh if I'm doing this posture there's some weird stuff
    going on in my joints we don't have to worry about that now I can put more Force
    into the ground than I weigh and if I do what will happen I go into the Earth
    I go to the side where will I go amazing spectacular yeah that's called jumping
    and basically what that means is for a period of time I put more Force into the
    ground then I we so I was periodically freed from the tyranny of Earth but then
    it comes back and grabs me and if you measured it it would be what what this was
    but with better handwriting

    from other people from like people using the software around the world but like
    that's nothing compared to all the other stuff cuz I didn't invent computers I
    didn't write like the the amount of code that goes into this where code is just
    math written in English uh is mostly spent like importing other people's packages
    like you import numpy and then you get to do linear algebra you you install Python
    and then you get to write stuff that looks like this and as you do like and it's
    so code is just text files it's that live on your computer and they get converted
    into binary and that crunches numbers and blah blah blah um and it winds up comprising
    like gigabytes of text files go into writing the the numbers that are being crunched
    on this thing and that is work that's being that was done by people over the past
    let's say 40 to 50 years arguably back to I mean you got Claude Shannon making
    basically writing down information Theory and then you got uh what's his name
    blle Park guy um Turing Allen Turing back in the 50s and you got like ad love
    lace going back to alisi who was a Iraqi um guy who invented the algorithm um
    back to Babylonians crunching numbers um and it all kind of goes together and
    luckily for us unlike the that made the motion capture system everybody that wrote
    the code that went into this pink line shared it they allowed other people to
    use it and they allowed their effort to make the world a generally better place
    where any human can do more things than they could have done before that person
    did that work the other alternative the standard practice and most of the software
    that you lose you use in your life is to do a bunch of work based off an understanding
    and a knowledge and a capacity that you have greater than the people around you
    then once you've made something useful exploit the disparity that you have created

    then you also pointed a laser me and then you told each other where you were sitting
    and what angle you were pointing the laser and as long as you both confirmed that
    it was like overlapping here you could do the math to figure out what the distance
    is even though you have no idea how far your laser is actually going conceptually
    make sense qualitative understanding I promise you the part where you know the
    math is not relevant to that Baseline understanding great so we did the 2D stuff
    we looked at the rectangle of of pixels and we did the this is the the part where
    it draws the Skeleton on top I guess you probably haven't see much of that data
    yet so I'll show it to you in a second remember what all this stuff is oh you
    might need to run it again oh never mind I lied so that part is where it gets
    shoved into blender uh did you all download blender a thing so blender is a free
    open source animation software again made for free and given to you the world
    as a gift freely given and it's made for animators and artists and people like
    that who are artists who specifically tra in the world of uh creating extremely
    precise 3D renderings of hypothetical worlds um is it still working oh it's thinking
    Yeah Yeah so basically yeah cool so we take there we go here I'll drive thank
    you you want see uh yeah okay

  text: behold je come on check it out it's the world you live in sort of oh I'm so
    Le having a mouse yeah oh oh there we go so that's Skelly and we ah oh I guess
    I kept going I have to figure out how to rotate alt there we go so not as high
    because I'm tired so this thing right here woo calm down that is my center of
    mass such as it is and if I do that I say in range I say round frame I say plus
    or minus 30 30 no 30 30 uh calculate uh yes haha oh and then I say uh don't show
    the frame numbers make it red no don't show the frame numbers look at it go so
    if you look so here I am standing man standing look at this rectangle of pixels
    and then look at this unbelievable gob smacky magic of being able to draw a DOT
    on my left shoulder and it's kind of correct this is the part that's kind of AI
    it's not I this is machine learning uses convolutional neural networks it's roughly
    the same math as what's the bot when you're talking to it but it's for pictures
    somehow don't worry about it this is the magical step this is the part that like
    shouldn't be possible it's also the part that's the hardest to like um understand
    from the outside the trigonometry and linear algebra stuff I do that all day I
    can know that it's right when I do it

  text: this one I can't luckily this weird magic step draws a skeleton on top of
    a picture of a person and I happen to have roughly 12 billion years of evolution
    that lets me be real good at telling you where the picture of the person is in
    the image so I can look at it and say yeah that's right that's working pretty
    good so that's very important that the only magical step in this pipeline is the
    part that you can confirm with your eyeball qualitatively and if you want to quantitatively
    understand if it's actually measured anything good you have to get like a PhD
    that's like literally what he's doing is like validating it beyond the gut check
    is like that's pretty good but if you want real numbers it's like a lot of work
    and then who how are we doing on time we're doing okay so now that's a silly skeleton
    um okay do that do that we say graph editor then we click on this guy again hey
    hey and then we say normalize and then oh and then we say I will data look at
    me go uh this tool this so blender is not a scientific tool it was not made to
    be a scientific tool I am abusing it into being a scientific tool uh and it's
    it is grateful for the experience um select grab grab ha so this is a complicated
    thing it's got ribs it's got a pelvis it's got this skull all these parts have
    weird shapes I didn't actually measure these things I didn't measure where the
    hips were I didn't measure much of anything uh I only measured these little dotos
    here and even that's pretty abstract and we're making inferences about what the
    more complicated shapes were doing by tracking those dots because we are going
    to pretend that things like pelvises and the associated meat are rigid bodies
    and because they are rigid bodies you only need to track a couple of points on
    them to know what the other ones are doing wobbly bodies don't have that property
    rigid bodies do so we like rigid bodies this skeleton is kind of aesthetic we
    can also look at huh these little stick o these sticks are the actual rigid bodies
    that we are

  text: inferring as the thing that connects the actual dots or the dots are the the
    3D positions that are triangulated from the things in the image so we we measured
    some rectangles of light we inferred some stick figures in 2D we constructed some
    Doos in 3D we put sticks on and we put a skeleton on them and now it's doing all
    this weird stuff but I got to be honest that's still pretty complicated it's got
    things like joints those joints have angles I don't want to have to deal with
    any of that so what we're going to do just going to take all of these things ah
    and shift all you guys not you hide you see control anyways let's see get you
    hide don't do that no who cares anyways yeah this cuz this is the trajectory of
    the whole body I don't want to analyze that I so luckily we can boil this whole
    guy down into just this and we can look at things like so I want to know what
    my like we talked about like putting those arrows into the ground in order to
    like launch ourselves off the floor if we're into that type of thing how how hard
    did I push off of the ground like how much force did I put into the ground when
    I did that jump I forgot the force plate and unfortunately that moment is gone
    forever right lost into the past all we have is the measurements that we had and
    those measurements are kind of these impoverished web Camy who's itss very abstract
    and I want to know how hard I pushed right I I care about that for some reason
    luckily physics is pretty rigid and I can make a lot of estimates about what was
    going on at some approximation by just looking at this weird shape because one
    of the interesting things about complicated bodies is no matter how complicated
    you are if I put you in a catapult I can predict your location very directly doesn't
    matter how complicated it is is it follows the same rules in the air um so even
    though

  text: I can't tell you what each knee was doing from this type of measurement I
    can't tell you what my hips and stuff were doing I can tell you in a broad stroke
    how many newtons my body is going to have to absorb when it gets from this point
    down to that point Boo and then you can also show I don't know if this is real
    real data if you really squint and believe me there's a little bit of a cuz I'm
    it's a lot of meat I got to throw around and I'll bet if you measured this it
    would be somehow worse than this what's worse hard to know we also know uh so
    now I'm doing this on my the ground I now so before I don't know which knee is
    doing what now I do because I've constrained the behavior to be easier to measure
    I can also see I'm kind of like bouncing around like I'm not staying in one place
    there's some control Loop that's happening I'm I'm guiding something there's something
    that's being steered whatever that thing is it's probably it feels like it should
    be related to whoever it was that lets me do this right seems like it should maybe
    maybe not this one's in my arm that one's in my leg this one's static that one's
    moving it's hard to know I couldn't really I could get this data in the big fancy
    lab but it would honestly be difficult it's not made for this type of stuff um
    you to put the full body on I couldn't have gotten that much data while standing
    in front of a classroom both because there's no cameras on the walls here and
    also just because it takes longer than that and I certainly couldn't have shown
    you how to do it because even if I could requisite aspect of that is start with
    a quarter million dollars that you're going to spend to record people whereas
    now it's spend 20 bucks on some webcams and figure out how to run stuff from command
    line you have to type and then push enter and that's the class so uh thank you
    for watching and um between now and next week somebody it's unclear who is going
    to take this data and kind of package it up and put it somewhere online that you
    can watch it and use it you might not then next week we'll get into like actually
    how to open the things look at the data and uh there's going to be an assignment
    for this week which is basically like talk to the bot about what the hell that
    was

  text: all about because every one of you watched every one of you saw something
    different when I did all that stuff and I am very curious about what comes out
    when you talk about it to the rectangle that is so friendly and polite okay thank
    you now we have 10 minutes to break down before someone gets mad at us question
    I sent you an email that saw I probably not okay is that like a good method to
    no uh I I just get so much email so you can absolutely send email but if I'll
    probably miss it shoot me a message on Discord it's the easiest way I didn't know
    if Discord is like too like informal it a little bit is um but like for the first
    message I was like I'm gonna be safe that's Wise Wise uh what was the question
    and also if if if I if it's important just send it again okay U I was just wondering
    about the ATT policy um if I like had to miss a class or like Thanksgiving break
    um is there like a zoom option no you're out sorry I e e e for
