full_transcript: okay hello everybody um so today we're going to talk about actual
  proper kind of sort of Neuroscience for arguably the first time which is always
  an exciting Point especially halfway through the semester um also in line with tradition
  uh I realized when I got in here that I had taken a bunch of notes and written a
  bunch of stuff up but then forgot to push it up so we don't have the most upto-date
  stuff here but that's fine um basically sort of this is the point of the semester
  where the Divergence from the plan becomes more noticeable uh so we are here roughly
  um and we did some of this stuff but not all of it we haven't talked about eyeballs
  yet but we'll start talking about vision and stuff probably next time um and uh
  yeah and and then the evolution stuff I'll probably combine together and we'll get
  to it the sort of soft goal is at some point before the end of the semester to get
  to a point where I'm talking about my actual proper human scientist research uh
  which has a lot of different sort of background aspects because it's visual control
  of locomotion over rough terrain so it's sort of all these things kind of like mush
  together um and then have enough time to do some additional topic stuff towards
  the end uh and I think we'll get there so um the so yeah so so catching up with
  where we currently are um we've done I guess so while I'm talking uh in the server
  at the top under this resources ch Channel um the same place we talked about last
  time so this thread called server scrape checkpoints click into that um I did figure
  out what was wrong with the last one it was a stupid windows thing so Windows has
  this thing where at some point in its history they decided that 280 characters is
  as is as long as a file path ever needs to be or in fact should be so it throws
  an error if your path links get too long which you can change that setting and say
  that's we don't need to do that anymore but this ZIP file had long file name so
  that's what the error was is like these pads are too long um so this 7z is a different
  form of zip that doesn't have that error so if you want to see where things were
  last week this one is the one that's up to date to that one this one uh was from
  this morning um and so if you download this unzip it it will still throw two errors
  um saying the p pkl and Json files are unhappy but just skip those and unpack the
  rest of it and try to open it up in obsidian and hopefully by the time you get to
  that point I will have gotten to that point in my conversation so give that a shot
  see how far you get um so the yeah so a lot of the stuff we've been doing up until
  now has been on the kind of like data and computational side of things so the the
  topic of the course is neural control of real world human movement and uh we're
  going to talk and so and so we've been focusing more up to this point on like basic
  methods and sort of like the kinds of data that you can collect and sort of the
  measurements that you can take and a little bit into the sort of more um I'll say
  like high theory side of things um so all the talk about full body Center of mass
  and sort of those like base level physics and sort of hyper simplified models of
  the body and sort of it moves around the world is all kind all of those things are
  kind of um about the study of it's more about the study of the neural control of
  real world human movement on the it basically focusing on the um like the kinds
  of measurements you can take like the the empirical investigation sort of like conversations
  there to pertaining um and we're going to go back into that methods Z stuff when
  we talk about Vision when sort of bring out the ey tracker and do sort of more data
  looking um but today I want to give more of a sort of focusing more on like the
  the landscape of um neur what we think about neural control and what we think about
  motor control this is something that I have I found myself when I was sort of going
  around in the conversations at the end at the last parts of previous classes something
  I sort of found myself referring back to a lot so it's not directly on the presume
  syllabus um but I want to talk today about uh the concept of the motor hierarchy
  as it pertains to the neural control of movement because it's one of those things
  where it's like it's a very fundamental aspect of our the our neural motor systems
  that it is arranged in this sort of hierarchical way um with the cortex and sort
  of the lumpy pink thing on top at the top of the hierarchy and then going down to
  the various sort of subcortical systems and spinal cord and muscles and sort of
  at the bottom of that hierarchy would be what you might consider like the base level
  physics of the world um and so we're going to talk about that uh but we're not going
  to do particularly deep dives into any aspect of it um because I want to give enough
  time for us to do more of the kind of splitting off into groups and doing our own
  Explorations this time we're going to we're going to do a little bit more clumping
  by presumed topic as we chop up the room into sort of like which part of this hierarchy
  do we want to talk about today and then the idea is to sort of try to use your Collective
  efforts to flesh out parts of the brief overview brief fast dense overview that
  I'm going to give in a second here so um we'll get to that in a second so um yeah
  uh so this kind of exploration of like you know y'all doing some of the work of
  helping to flesh out the landscape we've been playing with it a little bit with
  sort of talking to the bot and sort of asking it questions about your own presumed
  interests and um and as the semester has progressed I've made more progress into
  basically updating the code that I have been using to scrape those conversations
  out of the server and then put them into the a not not the bot but just another
  sort of like configuration of AI stuff um and basically asking a different llm configuration
  to pull out the topics that y'all have been asking about in order to get sort of
  a landscape of the topics that you have been interested in uh so in order to look
  at that uh yeah so on the assumption that you have downloaded the zip file uh and
  extracted it if you're on a Mac it'll look a little bit different but at this point
  in your life I assume you know how to unzip things if you don't ask a neighbor if
  your neighbor doesn't know just chill out and ask me later um but so you want to
  download it extract it and and this always gets creaky when I come on yeah and then
  extract it so it's just like a regular old folder in here uh just anywhere on your
  computer and then uh you should have at some point downloaded obsidian um obsidian
  MD just search for it it's a free software and when you so uh get it download it
  double click it it will look a little bit different the first time you open it but
  uh so weird did I do that on this computer yet I can't remember um and what you'll
  want to do is so for me it's down here again if you're on a Mac it might look a
  little different but uh you're going to want to find something that's that looks
  something like manage vaults or open vault or I think if you do like probably control
  o it might give you a screen that looks something like this um and the option that
  you want is called open folder as Vault uh obsid just calls folders vaults for whatever
  reason um so open that and navigate to the folder that you just extracted uh there's
  a bunch of like unnecessary subfolders in that zip file which I figured out this
  morning um it doesn't matter which one you pick uh but just to make it a little
  bit cleaner I'm going to click in through top level into AI processed um This Server
  scrapes is just the raw data so it's effectively the the MD markdown file that's
  that's attached to the top of each chat this is basically a folder full of those
  things with the F with sort of laid out in a similar structure to the server so
  I'm just going to click through that into AI processed and then this is the stuff
  for the not necessar way too many stuff in there uh so I'm in here and uh you will
  notice that these folder names correspond to the same categories that we have in
  the actual server and then if you click into that these will correspond to the names
  of the so that's in topics vision and then it's got the same names as all the the
  channels and then where'd it go oh I'm getting distracted as I often do okay so
  in here I'm GNA select this folder let obsidian open it up it's white for some reason
  I don't know why it decided to be light mode for me but that's fine enough for now
  and so there's a lot of stuff in here and basically if you click through this every
  so in now in addition to the the raw conversation which is attached to the bottom
  and you got links here if you click on the link it'll take you to that message in
  the server probably on the browser version of the server and then up here is sort
  of an extracted summary of the topics covered in this conversation which was presumably
  about it tracking and VR whoever it was that had that conversation um and there's
  a lot of like art to how to figure out like sort of the right way to tell and LM
  to chew on a Big Blob of text in order to pull out topics um but in this particular
  case I was mostly focused on just getting raw topics covered um so I gave it this
  structure of like you know pull out a title a extremely short summary highlights
  a very short summary a short summary and a detailed summary sort of like different
  levels of abstraction um you know to sort of make that do its thing and then importantly
  uh I also added pull out tags so these tags are just sort of hashtag uh this is
  called Kebab case because it's a dash it's lowercase numbers with little strings
  between them or uh hyphens between them and what the tags allow us to do is click
  on this little graph view thing over here and that gives us this fun thing here
  um so these dots are all of the so each one of these dots corresponds to one of
  the chats that was had and if we go over to filters and turn on tags these are all
  the tags that were covered um and so there's a couple thing to to note here first
  of all this is fun I love this type of thing uh and I think I can you could there's
  a lot of options for the display I don't know why it's in light mode but that's
  fine um let the text be a little there let the nodes be a little smaller ones be
  a little less thick um and so you can sort of navigate around in here the green
  ones are the tags and the black ones are the notes um this is the kind of thing
  like I don't want to belabor this particular Point too deeply and sort of get too
  hard into the the technical aspects of like how to use this type of stuff obsidian
  is nice because there's a lot of tutorials and stuff so if you're curious about
  how to take notes like this and sort of have your general notes that you're taking
  in your life have this sort of like nice internalized structure um just hop on YouTube
  and search for obsidian and you'll find lots of good stuff there um but the basic
  idea is so there's like certain tags so like biomechanics can I do it doesn't really
  help much but that's okay um so we've been doing so this is the biome mechanics
  tag so we've been doing a lot of talking about the biomechanics of the situation
  so unsurprisingly um that tag is present in a lot of your conversations and so if
  I click on that it will show me all of the tags that have been discussed and so
  you can look up uh let's say impact of knee injuries on biomechanics and so I click
  on there and this is a conversation that one of Y all had about about knee injuries
  and biomechanics and this is what was discussed in there and you can click on this
  and it will I take gu tap to the server version or the online browser version has
  to load up uh yeah so this was Grace if you're in here um where'd you go yeah wait
  is that the right one wait no it's a different thing yeah um yeah so biomechanic
  is very well connected uh straight Neuroscience is obviously well connected uh neural
  control is well connected um there's also come some like uh like orphans out here
  that are not connected so mathematical ambiguity and interpretations sometimes these
  are caused by like just like a conversation that's like super short so it's not
  there's not much content there but AI has like people pleaser energy so if you tell
  it to summarize something that only has like someone saying hello and then nothing
  else it will still try to come up with the full summary even though that's not valid
  to do um and in this particular case someone was asking yeah mathematics or of operations
  something that that oh actually no remember how I told you that I was not going
  to scrape the playground Channel um I lied it is in here because it's easier to
  not it's easier to just not ignore it so there are occasionally some of these that
  are like it's doing its best to pull a reasonable summary out of a conversation
  that is intentionally misleading um so uh okay and so I'm going to leave that roughly
  there um feel free to I guess another thing to say is you'll notice too that a lot
  of these tags are like not they're like they're orphan tax right these this is being
  included only in one conversation this thing sods is something that would probably
  be it'll probably be connected more once we finish talking about eye movements um
  but some of these two like trust right that the trust doesn't need to be a tag in
  this class and so that's something the way that I wrote The Prompt or I didn't do
  any cleanup after the fact it just pulled stuff that really shouldn't be there um
  brain computer interfaces probably should be in there um seeds in body someone was
  talking about eating plants I remember that that was a yeah um like there's some
  things here where you can kind of tell that like the way that it is extracted the
  information makes it more actually didn't do a terrible job this time but yeah so
  Consciousness variations like that should that tag should really be Consciousness
  and then anyone else who talked about that which I know there's at least a couple
  of you would get matched in there um you know so this is the case where like the
  way that the bot extracted the tags if that was done more sort of skillfully or
  carefully it would be a more connected um system of topics and content um so some
  of that is about having like more conversations to get more connection some it's
  about like making the prompt a little better and then anytime you're doing anything
  with AI and language generation there's always needs to be kind of like a human
  cleanup step so you know I could go through and clean this up I could ask you to
  clean it up um and maybe we'll do that uh we're going to be using musicin money
  what are you talking about uh yeah so figuring out how to like EXP this stuff like
  y'all can jump in there and look at what your classmates have been talking about
  um we're going to be doing in the latter part of the class sort of a little bit
  more toward in the direction of um y'all producing more like curated Blobs of text
  that are sort of designed to help pull together some of these disparate disconnected
  things um and I will be continuing over the course of the semester to sort of increase
  the sophistication of this extract action um and the idea is to sort of find a way
  to let all of you kind of like have the ways that you have been exploring this topic
  and the space um cohere into a sort of a a navigable landscape of this sort of comedically
  vast topic um yeah so yeah and then I I told it I tried to get it not to do this
  I told it like don't use names but this one's like this topic is about Caroline's
  interest in human anatomy and surgery it's like that should not that's the bad that's
  a bad title there but uh it's not Carolyn's fault that's just the way like being
  more careful with the prompting to like make sure that it doesn't do that stuff
  and keeping the style consistent because um I also just to make it run fast and
  cheap I this one was was processed by GPT 3.5 um who is dumber than G 3.4 or GPT
  4 and the latter ones um but it is also like very very very fast and like effectively
  free at this point so with this thing we're we're processing high enough volume
  of text that the cost becomes noticeable if you use the the bigger stuff and if
  if you use the the bigger models it would take you know half an hour to an hour
  or more to process all these things where it's with 3.5 it's effectively free and
  processes in like 30 seconds as opposed to like 30 minutes so um and for stuff like
  extracting summaries it's sort of smart enough for that that's what language natural
  language processing has been doing that for like 20 years um but you do kind of
  get like some Dum dumb Behavior where it's like that's not even the right capitalization
  there okay cool so um yeah so makees sense uh great if it doesn't make sense also
  fine um if you have technical issues getting it running and sort of getting the
  point where you can look at it we'll handle that in a little bit here um but yeah
  there's no real obligations for you with this side of class right now this is more
  of a I am giving you updates on my homework and this is where we're at with it because
  real work is typically speaking iterative in nature um okay so uh so this is the
  place where if I had successfully pushed my notes to the to GitHub I'm that would
  be looking at them right now um but they weren't particularly extensive anyway um
  so I'll take this as an opportunity to like show a little bit about how bot work
  um so with something like you know like I'm giving an undergraduate lecture on the
  motor hierarchy the neural motor hierarchy in your nervous system that is such a
  well-trod topic that's like sort of intro level to any any class that talks about
  motor Neuroscience is going to talk about the motor hierarchy so if I ask the bot
  to say give me a lecture outline for the motor uh motor hierarchy hierarchy um it'll
  give me something good especially because it already has the syllabus of the class
  kind of baked into it with that sort of the top level prompt um I have this other
  sort of yeah see perfect um uh I had this other sort of Channel over here where
  I just I use AI for my own purposes um which you can make your own as well if you
  want but we'll talk about that later or maybe not um and so in that server uh if
  I wanted to because it isn't prompted in the same way that this class is if I gave
  it that simple of a of a Preamble it wouldn't do as good of a job um but because
  this one is already in the context of like having the syllabus of the server the
  class already baked into itself um it does a decent job um oh uh give me the order
  from highest to lowest uh because it did that the other way um great um so so there
  you go now you have everything you need to know about the motor hierarchy not really
  um this kind of a thing and uh uh give me an additional outline about the corticos
  spinal corticospinal tract um yeah so that's another sort of area I wonder if it
  didn't mention that in the original yeah it did mention it briefly but that's this
  is another kind of thing so like when you're when you're navigating this kind of
  like AI mediated language space there's often kind of a a balance you want to you
  want to strike between like what I think of is like top down versus bottom up types
  of in investigations so where a bottomup approach is kind of like giving it a very
  loose instruction set and just saying just seeing what it pops out at you so like
  tell me about neuroscience and it'll like give you a broad scoped thing um versus
  more of a top down approach which is where you as the human uh give it more structure
  and you say no give me more specifically this this type of thing um and it you get
  different responses that way and they're both they both can be quite useful so the
  analogy and this is a sort of recurring theme when working with AI is often times
  the the strategies that work well with AI are also kind of like sort of Funhouse
  versions of things that just generally work when you're talking to humans um if
  for no other reasons then it was trained on human data um so like in this course
  when we started you know I said hey go have an introductory talk ask the bot about
  whatever you want um that's a very bottomup approach so I'm just saying hey room
  full of people ask this thing a bunch of questions just based on whatever you are
  interested in talking about and so when I do that and so a lot of the early part
  of this class sort of had that structure um the ones that are kind of driven by
  uh lectures a little more structured but a lot of the conversations so far have
  been very bottom up and this um meaning that I am not imposing a structure from
  the top down and so the like the topics that are covered and that sort of graph
  that was shown is sort of a result of kind of that bottom up type of approach um
  if I were to and so like I guess in contrast if we think about like the kind of
  conversations that happened in this channel where this was the one that happened
  after the uh the center of mass basis support lecture last time this is and I said
  hey now ask the now ask the bot questions have conversations about this lecture
  that's that's sort of it's more structured um but it's still fairly open um which
  and then that would be contrasted with like saying you know write a class write
  a paper about this topic so when you're working with AI and you're trying to sort
  of steer it and you're trying to you make it generate something that you feel like
  has some relationship to like your internal State like something that you are trying
  to bring out into the world um it's often very beneficial to sort of swap back and
  forth between these two modes of thinking so at saying hey give me an outline of
  this topic without a bunch of structure to it and then taking that structure that
  it gives you cleaning it up altering it editing it um and then giving it back and
  say hey give me some more give me some information about this outline flesh out
  this outline um and often times it's not even worth doing that first step if you
  already know what you're interested in just ask it specific questions and you'll
  get specific answers so it's sort of a there's just like different modes of using
  this thing and I thing I've mentioned a lot is sort of like I think one of the best
  things that these AIS are really good for is helping you flesh out your unknown
  unknowns like you know you have an interest in a topic but you don't even know enough
  to know the parts that you have questions about so just ask it generally tell me
  more about this and it'll give you a bunch of stuff and then you'll say I didn't
  even know what these words are and then ask about those words and you kind of navigate
  it that way um but you also want to be able to like drive the conversation a bit
  um anyway so I mostly asked to give me this just to have a uh a cheat sheet of the
  actual Parts I wanted to talk about I always have to do this right okay so do it
  like that can I do this I guess I can do that like that this is the part where I
  get mad at Discord for poor use of space okay so um the motor hierarchy broadly
  speaking uh corresponds to the basically the the organization of responsibilities
  that within your motor cortex your motor sorry not your motor system um from the
  high level abstract sort of thoughts of things like I'm thirsty I wish I had water
  uh I'm hungry I want to eat um very abstract thoughts down to the level of like
  I am trying to put Force into the world so that I can move my body in the direction
  of water in the direction of food um and the ways that we kind of like the way that
  like like the needs of like in order to complete a given task you have to have a
  combination of those different levels because if you're only thinking about the
  motor system as like a thing that's attached to your muscles that that puts forces
  into the world in order to like pick up objects and push on the ground and do things
  like that um you're never actually going to get like coordinated Behavior as you're
  moving in the direction of goals and stuff like that at the same time if you're
  only thinking about stuff in the context of like high order volitional desires of
  you know I prefer Fruit to to wheat um like I'm I get thirsty when I talk a lot
  or something like that um then you're not going to have the kind of like goal- driven
  behaviors that actually make uh coordinated movement actually like meaningful and
  produce actual results um so I want to can I zoom in here yeah sure so again and
  I I think I did a picture kind of like this at the beginning but I'm just going
  to try to give you more of like an atlas of these parts and how they connect to
  each other and then work together on like fleshing out the details and specifically
  today I want you guys to start use like looking at papers and looking up papers
  on these topics and then using the bot to help you like chew on some of the the
  deeper stuff there so again moving away from like asking the raw AI to tell you
  sort of textbook level stories about you know highle stuff basically like if Wikipedia
  could talk and start using it more as like a tool that you can use to navigate Waters
  that are deeper than you can navigate on your own uh so let's start with the brain
  so first thing you got to do is draw a brain do it roughly like that it's a brain
  um specifically that's a mamalian brain malean brain yeah so this is not a brain
  someone asked an AI to draw a brain for them that's not what a brain looks like
  this is an inside of a brain um yeah where are the pictures I'm looking for they
  roughly similar but the main the main part that I try to draw when I'm just doing
  that sketch is this part right here is the that lumpy part going down that's your
  temporal lobe by your temple um and then the rest is kind of squiggly it's I mentioned
  this before but like you eventually start to learn that like all these little like
  squishes and folds and stuff like that they all have names um and they're not random
  and you can kind of start to when you see brains in popular media if it was based
  off of an actual brain or if it's just someone who just like it's just a bunch of
  squishy red stuff oh yeah this is the picture I was looking for so it's all a little
  bit different they're all rough they're not shaped all the same but they all have
  this see this is not a real brain they're missing some important parts which is
  not great for a actual part there but that's fine um and this is a this is a object
  of pure horror so so your so there you go you got the your this is your temporal
  lobe and then this stuff up here is the front uh give yourself some eyeballs and
  that sort of goes in um that's forward uh which is actually well it's fine for English
  speakers we tend to put things point the other way but that's okay uh I always I
  always I don't know I was raised speaking Arabic so I learn sometimes right to left
  comes more naturally and I was like I don't know if that's actually normal um or
  if that's just I don't know who cares um so don't put that one up let's put something
  like this one let's give us a proper actual brain please oh yeah there we go so
  this frontal lobe here um is all mammals have it I don't want we're really going
  to talk about Mamon brains here because I don't know how any of the rest of them
  work um birds in particular I'm very curious about but they can be very intelligent
  with very strange with very different nervous systems and I don't know much about
  that um but but the the frontal lobe is sort of like the traditionally most human
  part there's a lot of parts of our brain that are quite different from other animals
  um it's often just in terms of like the raw volume um but particularly when you
  start going into like you know the the our Dumber mammal friends like your cats
  and your your your rats and whatnot the biggest differences tend to be a lack of
  that very pronounced bulbous frontal lobe and where is that stupid thing oh there
  it is um and so this part here is also roughly speaking generally speaking the very
  top of the motor hierarchy is that frontal lobe executive function um and yeah and
  so typically speaking and anytime someone's giving you any kind of specific words
  about how the brain works please understand it is a cartoon version of reality and
  reality is always weirder more abstract and less understood than anything anyone
  could ever say while standing in a space talking to you in a room um but generally
  speaking it is thought that like that is where your sort of your volitional control
  comes from volition is like roote of voluntary it's like the voluntary aspects of
  things like I want to pick up this box and so I will pick up this box that that
  initial desire is the volitional aspect of things and that is sort of you know cartoon
  wise thought to sort of originate here in the prefrontal cortex you know frontal
  prefrontal cortex um and the yeah so that's where those sort of like the most abstract
  form of your motor desires originate in that sort of frontal lobe area um this is
  where the the the description of the content of the neural activity or the patterns
  of neural activity that we call motor control there um is abstract to the point
  of not even really referencing the body like it's sort of like I I wish I had water
  um I wish I had food or something like that um and yeah and so that again cartoon
  wise is sort of passed back through like yeah frontal prefrontal premotor motor
  um and then this part here sort of like on either side of your head is the part
  we traditionally call the primary motor cortex which will look something like this
  is the part that tends not get drawn yeah there we go that's what I was for before
  um again cartoon versions of reality has not it's not based on nothing there's a
  reason why we draw this cartoon and not some other cartoon um but nothing is this
  clean um and the basic trajectory is that the those original highle volitional aspects
  of control are sort of they get passed through different sub regions of that of
  that brain um you're this part is sort of roughly your premotor cortex which sort
  of starts to get more specific and then by the time you get to the motor cortex
  that's where things are thought to start having a resemblance to your body so you
  have this is again another this is the kind of picture that you will see in a lot
  of textbooks about Neuroscience you may have seen it before um it's also the kind
  of thing that you will never see in a talk about motor cortex this is the kind of
  thing where this picture of so this is sort of the idea that like you know different
  parts of your brain handle the movement of different parts of your body and so you
  get this very over representation of things like your hands which has a lot of motor
  control associated with it and much less representation of things like your hip
  and leg which are sort of more simplified um and then you know over representation
  of things like the face because we do things like talking and so the idea is that
  the you know again this the cartoon version of the story is that the highlevel desires
  to like you know grab a cup of water something like that gets passed through to
  the lower from the high level at the frontal loes and then passed through to the
  sort of more specific areas of the motor cortex and then translated into sort of
  a more body mapped um description of like how to move from one place to the other
  um and that is there's this horrible little man uh sensory motor homunculus that
  sometimes gets drawn as the this is what you look like on the inside this is your
  your your body map of yourself this is basically your body well not necessarily
  yours but um mapped to the sort of the uh the cortical magnification of the different
  parts of your movement this is uh clearly the sensory uh homunculus if you can't
  figure out why that's a lesson to the reader um but the the idea is that if you
  were to map out your like motor awareness and your sensory specificity um this is
  kind of what you would look like um however this is also the kind of thing as I
  mentioned that yeah and this so there's the sensory C this the the motor cortex
  is sort of very close to the Sens the somata sensory cortex which is sort of like
  the sensory aspect of things so in the same way that we would you know move our
  elbows wrists and hands we also have Sensations from those areas and they are sort
  of right next to each other um but again I have seen many many talks from many many
  people often on the topic who study things like motor control and sensory motor
  control and the topic of those talks is typically trying to say please stop showing
  this to students it is not an accurate representation of reality um but then and
  then they say a bunch of much much more complicated stuff about how it's not really
  how it is but it it it's it's this is the easiest way to discuss things like cortical
  magnification at the motor and sensory levels um just understand that it is not
  a nice clear clean map it is not a the type of thing like oh here's where your wrist
  is here's where your hand is it's much more complex it's much more spread out it's
  much less organized um but if you sort of zoom out and squint and turn your head
  this cartoon version of reality is a good place to start this is also the kind of
  thing where if you wanted to look up more recent papers about the structure and
  organization of the motor cortex sensory motor cortex you'll find a lot of good
  stuff people actually doing that work it's also the kind of thing where if you ask
  the bot to tell you about this it will probably it will probably tell you this part
  and you might have to push it to be like is that really what people think and it
  might be like uh I actually don't know what it would do I think that is getting
  to the level of specificity and contemporariness of research where the fact that
  the bot has eaten every textbook might make it harder for it to deviate from the
  cartoonized version of reality that we tend to put into textbooks so this would
  be a if you wanted to sort of try to push the bot Until It Breaks um you might try
  to find a more recent paper on this topic and then find places where the bot gives
  you stuff that is not actually aligned with what we think in reality um just kind
  of had a brief moment of thinking about how that relates to things like Wikipedia
  but I think Wikipedia is famously fast so Wikipedia tends not to sort of hold on
  to wrong thoughts for very long so I think Wikipedia would probably give you like
  quicker and director sort of summary overviews of more modern thinking um but I'm
  actually not sure that's one of those spots so anyways so motor hierarchy so here
  we are we're starting in the frontal frontal cortex we going back to the motor cortex
  um later when we talk about Vision Vision tends to start here in the occipital lobe
  and so there is this kind of like sense of like this chunk of the brain is for sensory
  information and then this chunk is for like high level thoughts and abstraction
  and motor cores and stuff like that and then this part down here is weird we don't
  talk about it I don't talk about it CU that's more about like recognizing a cup
  you know for more like like memory and sort of more like contentful thinking but
  I don't know much about that but that's why I don't know about why but like the
  motor cortex being here and the samat cortex being there the way that I can remember
  that is because the samat cortex is closer to the visual cortex because that's like
  the vision side of things which only helps if you know where the visual cortex is
  but they are they sort of meet here um and I'm going to I'm going to continue the
  story but just so you know from this juncture is there's also a path that says uh
  that sort of bypasses the route that I'm about to tell you that things tend to go
  so we started out saying hey I wish I had water that gets sort of trundle along
  and gets converted into something like a motor plan in the motor cortex that says
  oh hey there's there's water right there and I let's assume I don't care about the
  fact that it's not mine I could reach out and grab that which would require taking
  a couple steps moving my arm out and sort of grabbing the thing um not withstanding
  the complexity of the fact that there was steps involved so that's sort of that's
  a whole other conversation um and I think that's also where a lot of the the question
  marks in the in the research live right now is like what happens when you have a
  motor plan that needs to sort of evolve over time like I need to walk over there
  and then do a behavior that's I think a do an area of Neuroscience that we really
  don't know as much about um and that's where the specific tagline of this course
  being about the neural control of human movement in the real world is where it starts
  to touch parts of Neuroscience that we just we just don't really know much about
  because if you think about the methods involved the vast vast vast majority of Neuroscience
  research psych psychological research is done of people sitting in chairs doing
  stuff on a tabletop doing single joint movements and our ability to measure the
  neural activity of humans in general but animals specific like animals at all moving
  around in a in a space while also recording the brain is uh we basically can't we
  we can start to we have we have been starting to be able to do that over the past
  like decade or so but still a lot of the theories that we have are based on Research
  that does not involve the animals being able to like move through the world and
  actually sort of have multi-step process dis so if you have questions about how
  that works the answer is we largely don't know um but find some papers and you might
  find people who are working on those questions so all of this is happening in the
  cortex right the big lumpy pink thing on the top um and there's a bunch of other
  stuff that we tend to call that sort of a lot of other parts of your central nervous
  system that we lump together Under The Heading of subcortical regions um and personal
  favorite is the cerebellum which is this sort of lumpy part down there um cerebellum
  cerebellum little brain great um but and I'm going to talk about that in just a
  second but there's another component that I want to at least mention honorable mentions
  of a a particular piece that sort of lives in the middle we're doing a side view
  all these parts are D are doubled um on either side and for some reason your left
  side control the left side of your brain controls the right side of your body don't
  ask me why just how we evolved um but there is this very important part called the
  basil ganglia um and this is particularly interesting for those of y'all that are
  interested in things like movement disorders um because it's a part that can go
  wrong in various interesting ways um because the idea is that when you have this
  when you have that high level thought of like I want to be I wish I was holding
  this this box and I'm sitting here and I'm looking at the Box there's a lot of different
  ways that my body could solve that problem I could grab it with my dominant hand
  I could grab it with my non-dominant hand I could grab it with my dominant hand
  in a weird way I could move over here and grab it with my dominant hand all of these
  are options that would satisfy that highle volitional desire to be holding this
  box in my hand and so with any kind of a network so we we often talk about the brain
  in this kind of like serial processing kind of like computer analogy this is in
  line with our general approach of just humans a general approach of always describing
  the nervous system in the context of the most advanced piece of technology that
  we have if you go back through history we tend to always do that um uh so anytime
  you're talking about a network it the thinking is and again this is deep into the
  cartoon version of stories that when I have the desire to pick up a certain object
  or pick up a pen or whatever um the motor Network components that would generate
  that action all get activated a little bit and they get activated to the point and
  they're sort and then they they engage in a kind of like competition with each other
  um motor plan competition I think is a term you could look up for that um and but
  it wouldn't really work if every time I had a thought all the possible options to
  make that thing happen were activated at the same time um so that's where the this
  little Superior calculous guy his presumed cartoonized role is to suppress your
  motor commands until they reach a certain threshold of activation and in this very
  abstract sense the the best motor command wins out and then that one crosses the
  threshold and then that's the the one that gets triggered and actually moves through
  so in this case it's closest to my dominant hand I like using my dominant hand this
  is a com a comfortable strategy this is a not comfortable strategy so this motor
  command wins the fight between all the possible ways I could solve that problem
  and that's the one that occurs um and there are and there's you can talk for days
  about the details there the substantial Niagara and blah blah blah um but the point
  I wanted to to to point out here is that there are at least two ways that that process
  could go wrong um one process one way is that the the the gating like this the suppression
  that the superior click list does can be too strong to the point where none of those
  commands actually make it through the gate and I'm sitting here wanting to move
  but I I can't actually initiate the action um and that way of things going wrong
  is typically what happens in things like Parkinson's disease uh one of the Parkinson
  is complicated but one of the family of symptoms is things like freezing um freezing
  in Gate freezing in motor command and people sort of they they see what they want
  to do and they can't initiate the action and that is thought to be related to the
  superior calculus sort of gaing the problem too hard so none of the available motor
  commands are able to sort of trip trip over the the the gate and actually make the
  in things initialize um and there's interesting stuff there um another way that
  that can go wrong is the thing I said before of like it would be bad if all the
  motor commands happened all at once um and that's another thing that can happen
  in um specifically in a disease called Huntington's disease which is a uh famously
  um famously genetically predictable motor disease um it's like one of these things
  like it's very heritable and if you have in it's like a 50 50 shot of inheriting
  it from a given parent so if one of your parents has Huntington's disease you have
  a 25% chance of having Huntington's disease and like we can just look at your genome
  and be like oh yeah you got it or oh yeah you don't so it's a sort of socially horrible
  thing and there's like I think there's like episodes of like house or things where
  it's like like what are the ethics of of a having a kid if you know there's a 25%
  they're going to have this degenerative disorder and B um what are the ethics of
  checking if you have it you know and if you get some assay of tests it may happen
  that the doctors just know the answer to whether or not you are going to have a
  degenerative M of disorder later in your life and so you know all sorts of not so
  fun conversations there um but people with Huntington disease exhibit Behavior where
  they basically have like movements that they didn't really intend to initiate that
  sort of make it over the hump um before they were able to be sort of stopped um
  and that's where you get Strange Behaviors where like if you show if you hold um
  like a cup with a handle in front of somebody who has things like Huntington's disease
  they have a very hard time not reaching out and grabbing it um because they they
  they see it they see the possibility of grabbing it and their Superior cus or whatever
  span cartoons whatever is not able to suppress that behavior so they they just reach
  out and grab things that they weren't intending to um so anyways there's a lot more
  going on in there but I did want to mention that just because I know that there's
  a general good chunk of ypre Ed so a good chunk of y'all are interested in movement
  disorders and a lot of movement disorders tend to live in in and around that that
  area um anyway so once those motor but once the motor Comm has been connected or
  sort of chosen or selected or sort of made it over that hump that's where there's
  there's a Cascade of activations that sort of happen from that point and generally
  speaking that will then sort of leave the brain and sort of first well I don't know
  about first but uh it will sort of get into the cerebellum and then into the brain
  stem and then into the spinal cord um cerebellum very complicated thing very complex
  thing uh roughly 3.5 as many 3.5 times as many neurons in your cerebellum as there
  are in the rest of your central nervous system combined um they tend to be very
  small very you know specific or not specific uh they're very small neurons um like
  granular cells but also very large neurons called paramal cells I will look at pamal
  cells because they're beautiful pyramidal cells neurons so you get these oh this
  is the one I was looking for this is the kind of thing you win a the you win Nobel
  prizes for pictures like that um back in you know 1800s um but these are the type
  of neurons that you get this might actually be in your motor cortex but these like
  highly highly uh synaptic like like massive synaptic for Forest where the output
  of the neuron whether or not it's spiking is dependent on this massive Network of
  connection to other parts of your body um or other parts of your nervous system
  um versus more yeah anyways um your cerebellum is thought to be the area that sort
  of handles things like motor coordination um and that's coordination that happens
  at different levels like most of your nervous system there sort of an inside out
  structure where the the inner parts of your cerebellum like the inner parts of your
  brain is the most phenic ancient is the oldest part and as you sort of go outwards
  you get more and more evolutionarily new stuff um until you get out to the the neocerebellum
  which is the outer this it looks like a lump but it's kind of folded up and on itself
  um and the neoc serums on the outside and that's the part that's thought to be associated
  with things like tool use and the fact that I can pick up an object that's not a
  part of my body and sort of like wave it around and then oh yeah now I sort of like
  internalized some of the physics of this thing and that ability to internalize the
  physics and sort of utilize external objects as if they were a part of my body is
  thought to be related to the neocerebellum and there's some interesting studies
  and fmri where they have people like playing with tools and stuff like that um and
  I always get like stuck on these little side quests because there I just have to
  tell the story because it's so interesting um not all animals can use tools obviously
  um but they there's a concept in Neuroscience called your Perry personal space and
  we tend to chop up the world into spots and you know out there that's like far away
  stuff um in here this is like like this is my actual body part and then there's
  the peripersonal space which is like close by areas like roughly speaking things
  that I can reach with my sort of with my current body um and so anything that's
  on this table is peripersonal space and if you take a monkey like a MAAC monkey
  a non-human primate one of the fews that we study and you can get certain so you
  can Le you can leion the brain in various ways and you get various types of blindness
  um and it's possible to get a type with a particular damage in a particular area
  um actually don't know that level um you can get a blindness in peripersonal space
  so you basically there's just like you can't see things that are sort of within
  a certain range of you and they there's a crazy study um where they they took a
  MAA and they were able to give it like a reversible lesion so they it's like they
  put uh chemical in that part of the brain so it just stops working for a little
  while but then after a while it comes back and they trained the monkey to use a
  grabber like a grabber thing to like reach out and grab things that are farther
  away than their arms reach and after the monkey was trained in using the Grabber
  arm and they did the cortical Legion the their peripersonal space extended to include
  the regions that they could reach with the Grabber so there's just this strange
  implication of like how we tend to view the world and how we tend to char carve
  it up into like things that are me things that are not me and then things that I
  can directly manipulate and for certain types of mammals um that that that question
  of like what is what part of the world is my body and what part of the world can
  I interact with my body includes things like tools it includes things that are not
  necessarily part of the raw biology which is just gets into the philosophy of things
  especially when we start extending the concept of tools away from things like Grabbers
  and Hammers and you know sharp pointy rocks and into things like laptops and the
  internet and large language models like these are all these things like we tend
  to really prioritize like the meat wear um and do things like make you take tests
  on pen and paper even though who gives a about what you can like recall under um
  but there's a whole concept of like embodied cognition which sort of tries to extend
  that notion that like we really are like ourselves plus our tool set plus you know
  our community of people who can help us with things and that's anyways gets complicated
  and philosophical very quickly um so yeah and then the lower parts of cerebellum
  the older Parts handle things like motor coordination and so things like if I want
  to so you have your flexion parts and you have your extension Parts your muscles
  these ones like Flex the flexion tends to move you towards like the fetal position
  extension tends to move you opposite of that and in order for a movement to be smooth
  those things like the flexor extensor groups have to fire in a very tight temporal
  Loop um and if you if they misfire then you get again kind of like Behavior kind
  of like you know I hate doing like I hate simulating it because it sort of feels
  weird but like you can imagine sort of like seeing people with movement disorders
  they have this kind of like jerky movements um that can be it can come from a lot
  of different places but it can be associated with basically like misfiring where
  you're like if I'm extending my arm then my flexor of my then the tricep should
  be um engaging and the bicep should be loose but if my biceps kept firing while
  I'm trying to extend my arm then you get this kind of like jerkier behavior um and
  that's coupled with like uh another type of disorder which can have which can lead
  to sort of what they call like the drunkard's wobble like when you're like where
  you sort of like it's more of a swim or type of thing where it's like this is where
  like my my postural control system is firing but it's like slow so you get this
  kind of like more of a soupy type of movement so those are all just different parts
  of the Cascade of things that can go wrong in the motor system um cell taxia is
  one of those terms you can look up anyway um so yeah that's cerebellum uh your your
  brain stem is kind of hanging out here brain stem is honestly a part that I know
  least about it's it's sort of a level below the cerebellum it sort of has to do
  more with like um it's thought to be related to like like sensory integration um
  but it's kind of like in my understanding of this space I kind of like lump it in
  with like that that host of like very lowlevel Integrations between like that sort
  of like um like flexor extensor groups and like timing and you know like integration
  of sensory information where that sensory information mean like the forces that
  are happening at your joints less than like the visual information um so you know
  if you wanted to look up how the brain stem interacts with stuff then you could
  do that but I don't have as much information there um a part that I do know more
  about is the spinal cord uh which is we tend to think of in common parament like
  I people like often times when we draw the nerve the central nervous system we draw
  it like this and we cut off the spinal cord um this is this is wrong this is incorrect
  your spinal cord is a part of your nervous of your central nervous system and it
  does a lot of really interesting and important aspects of uh your your motor control
  um your spinal cord spinal cord yeah there we go Wikipedia so your spinal cord doesn't
  go all the way down your spinal column spinal columns the the bone part um it stops
  around here so like right below your rib cage and then the rest is like um peripheral
  nerves that sort of go in and out to the actual inating the muscles um it flips
  inside out so your your your cortex has the the gray matter which is all the bodies
  of the neurons on the outside and all the the wires and the white matter which is
  like the gal cell wrapped things on the inside spinal cord flips that around so
  all the the goopy wiring stuff is on the outside side and this is sort of the this
  blue stuff here is the same gray matter that's on the outside of your cortex um
  and the kinds of I never have enough time to talk uh the uh like your your spine
  is that we're now getting down to like the very the very bottom of that motor hierarchy
  uh and the the kinds of controls you get at the spinal level are still definitely
  in the space of what we would call like processing um but they are there's there's
  very little abstraction if anything down there so that's where your spinal cord
  handles things like your reflexes um so like if you ever go to the doctor and they
  hit you on the knee and then it kicks your you hit you on the knee the tendon and
  it kicks your knee out um that they're testing your spinal reflexes and one of the
  most lowlevel ones is the monosynaptic stretch reflex which is if this muscle is
  stretched uh there is a refle there is a reflex that makes it contract it's sort
  of a protective thing so when you hit the tendon it stretches the muscle and then
  that goes up to the spine and the The Reflex there is if that muscle uh stretched
  then contract it and that's why you you kick out um however it's not as simple as
  just a sort of there's a reflex that's there and it's always there because if that
  reflex was always active then you wouldn't be able to do things like move your leg
  because every time you moved it it would stretch and then that would make it contract
  so your spine handles what's called like reflex gating um and where in order to
  engage a given motor plan the reflexes have to be configured in a certain way um
  and the most sort of famous and my personal favorite example of that is in the context
  of the locomoter gate cycle where when you're walking you're sort of going back
  and forth between each leg is sort of going back forth between stance phase where
  in stance phase you're weight you're holding the entire weight of your body on on
  a very stiff leg if you're running or something like that when you impact the ground
  you're impacting it with like 1.4 or more times your body weight so your leg has
  to be very stiff in that moment when it hit the ground someone I think asking about
  like like if you step off of a stair and you think there's going to be another stair
  there or there's one more one fewer stairs than than you expect you have that kind
  of like very unpleasant moment where the limb Was preparing for the ground that
  was not at the right level um so sorry so when you're stepping back and forth your
  legs are going back and forth between stance phase where all of your your reflexes
  are sort of cranked down to let your leg be very stiff and support your whole way
  to your body and then swing phase where they're all kind of turned off basically
  to let your leg be much more floppy and loose so it can swing through and basically
  utilize its own momentum and to allow it to sort of move forward um without having
  to like burn a bunch of muscles burn a bunch of energy like moving it directly and
  so that transition from like stance to swing phase which happens roughly every 450
  milliseconds roughly a million times per year for a healthy undergraduate human
  um that transition is happening at the level of the spine and that the specifically
  the timing of transitioning from one to the other is handled by things called Central
  pattern generators which is where a lot of the basic rhythmicity of motor motor
  control comes from most of your motor system is rhythmic in nature so you're walking
  you're chewing you're scratching you're doing things that are kind of like have
  a rhythmic a rhythmic aspect to it um and that's kind of handled by these sort of
  central pattern generators but then where the hierarchy kind of comes in the sort
  of motor hierarchy tends to come in in order for the for movements to be graceful
  and coordinated and smooth they have to be appropriate for the world as it lays
  out so if I'm stepping up onto a a a step or stepping down at something or from
  you know interacting with the world um there is a supervenience that happens where
  the those high level volitions those high level desires attached coupled with like
  visual information sort of like sensory information both out in the world um gets
  translated into basically a set of instructions for how we should lay out the the
  reflexes and sort of you know how like like what the timing and the strength and
  the gains of all these reflexes should be in order to generate movements that are
  appropriate for the world that's around you so the idea is like that down here at
  the lowest level of the nervous system um these very very lowlevel things are happening
  on the basis of instruction sets that come from the top down but then if you but
  then also like the signals from the world also go in the other direction so there's
  this kind of like it's a it's a communication that's a two-way communication but
  it's not symmetric so it's sort of that's where the the concept of the hierarchy
  comes in um because the top tends it tends to be the top tends to tell the the top
  the high level stuff tends to tell a lowl stuff what to do but if the lowle stuff
  says oh wait no I actually hit something then if you're nervous the high level stuff
  will sort of take that into account and handle things appropriately um never never
  have time um I am just going to briefly mention so the the little story we've been
  telling now about hierarchy and things like that is a sort of the general again
  cartoonized version of the motor hierarchy and it tends to be um played out this
  tends to be how like mamalian nervous systems at least tend to be organized um I
  sort of skipped a aspect here of like muscle synergies of sort of like you know
  like my arm all the muscles in my arm are handled kind of like in conjunction with
  each other so I'm not doing things like controlling each muscle individually I'm
  not controlling each degree of Freedom individually um they're handle more at this
  what's called like a synergistic level and for most mammals that's what you get
  you get this kind of like the front the high level stuff sort of activates these
  like motor planes which activate these motor hierarchies and that's about where
  things tend to end however uh for a small subset of animals specifically tool using
  mammals um but I again I'm not sure like things like corvids and stuff play into
  this but we have like a freaky special other tract called the corticospinal tract
  where we have parts of the nervous system like that bypass all of this other stuff
  and kind of go down and directly innervate the spine so cortico spinal tract so
  cortex to spine and and again I think that's that's an area where like by basically
  by saying what I just said I'm I'm roughly exhausting my knowledge on the topic
  uh I think it's an area of very active research in terms of like which animals have
  a cortical spinal tract which mean which ones and which ones don't like I think
  it's with Biology it's never a case of like yes or no it's Al always a matter of
  degree but it is one of it's again one of those places that is thought to be related
  to our ability to be like magnificent adaptation engines where we can control our
  body and basically an arbitrary level of ways and sort of this very high level of
  precision and um find control is thought to be related to in addition to things
  like the neocortex which is handling this sort of like tool using stuff also the
  cortical spinal tract which is sort of giving like I think about things like learning
  like gymnastics and stuff like that where you're you're doing something and then
  someone says oh no no not like that like that like your your like your your H your
  heel is off by an inch and a half in this direction change the motor plan on the
  basis of like words that I'm saying to you and I think like when I like philosophically
  poetically think about the nervous system I think that it's that type of control
  that's being sort of implicated by in things like the cortical spinal track and
  stuff like that um CU I just think that like you know comparing human movement to
  other types of animal movement like one of the main questions of like what makes
  us different is related to our infinite adaptability relative to most other animals
  it's you know we'll talk a bit about that in the evolution phase of life um and
  that goes out to your limbs and does muscle stuff uh okay I that's about as quick
  as I can ever make anything I guess so anyways that's roughly speaking your nervous
  system at least the motor control parts of it um and I yeah obviously covered a
  lot of ground said a lot of things um and so for the rest of the class I guess I'll
  just let youall be like locally clumped at this point I I I might just have to have
  a whole classroom I don't know because it's like there's so much I want to say to
  you but I also want to give you time to explore on your own so we'll we'll figure
  that out um probably not time for code stuff this time around so um I will say let's
  do roughly like we did last time where we pop into a channel in the lectures area
  called 2024 10 15 uh motor hierarchy I don't know if I spelled hierarchy correctly
  but um this there you go doop perfect no questions um yeah and uh just kind of do
  what we did last time so so pop open some some chats and just ask it some questions
  and what I'll specifically ask you to do this time which I haven't done in the past
  is rather so follow your heart so if you wanted to ask sort of more of this kind
  of like highlevel like like give me the textbook version of the story go ahead and
  do that if you want to dive deeper into like the nittier grittier side of things
  where the the cartoons break down um ask the bot for keywords that you can punch
  punch into things like PubMed or Google Scholar and look for papers on the topic
  um that it's questioned for uh don't ask it for specific papers it will either give
  you papers that are old um or it will give you papers that don't exist uh SL chat
  um and uh so ask it for keywords and then go search for those those uh those papers
  you can ask for things like review articles but just ask it for keywords that you
  can search for and then when you find the paper copy the entire abstract and paste
  the abstract into the chat and then ask it to explain that to you um because obviously
  you could read the abstract and figure it out for yourself but abstracts are necessarily
  and intentionally extremely dense linguistic blobs so there's pretty much no abstract
  on the planet that you couldn't spend several lifetimes trying to parse out all
  of the details and all the words and all the unfamiliar phrases um and let's do
  that for Jesus Christ 13 minutes and uh yeah I'll say so I that's not much to get
  into so just I'm not going to make it an official assignment but like continue this
  conversation with the bot throughout the day and throughout the week just just like
  every so often just pop over in the chat and just ask it a question um you know
  I'm not going to necessarily make that assignment I'll make assignments later but
  like you know anytime you have a thought just pull it out and ask it the question
  um because I will be doing the scrape and pull stuff throughout the week and then
  you know I'll do it again before next week so if you want to have some ability to
  steer what that content is ask it questions about the things that you care about

    summary - \n\nThe lecture introduces the concept of the motor hierarchy in neuroscience,
    focusing on the neural control of human movement. It discusses the structure from
    the cortex to subcortical systems, spinal cord, and muscles, emphasizing the role
    of the frontal lobe, motor cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia. The instructor
    highlights the importance of understanding motor plan competition and its implications
    for movement disorders like Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. The cerebellum's
    role in motor coordination and tool use is explained, along with the spinal cord's
    function in reflexes and central pattern generators. The lecture encourages students
    to explore these topics further using AI tools and research papers.

  text: okay hello everybody um so today we're going to talk about actual proper kind
    of sort of Neuroscience for arguably the first time which is always an exciting
    Point especially halfway through the semester um also in line with tradition uh
    I realized when I got in here that I had taken a bunch of notes and written a
    bunch of stuff up but then forgot to push it up so we don't have the most upto-date
    stuff here but that's fine um basically sort of this is the point of the semester
    where the Divergence from the plan becomes more noticeable uh so we are here roughly
    um and we did some of this stuff but not all of it we haven't talked about eyeballs
    yet but we'll start talking about vision and stuff probably next time um and uh
    yeah and and then the evolution stuff I'll probably combine together and we'll
    get to it the sort of soft goal is at some point before the end of the semester
    to get to a point where I'm talking about my actual proper human scientist research
    uh which has a lot of different sort of background aspects because it's visual
    control of locomotion over rough terrain so it's sort of all these things kind
    of like mush together um and then have enough time to do some additional topic
    stuff towards the end uh and I think we'll get there so um the so yeah so so catching
    up with where we currently are um we've done I guess so while I'm talking uh in
    the server at the top under this resources ch Channel um the same place we talked
    about last time so this thread called server scrape checkpoints click into that
    um I did figure out what was wrong with the last one it was a stupid windows thing
    so Windows has this thing where at some point in its history they decided that
    280 characters is as is as long as a file path ever needs to be or in fact should
    be so it throws an error if your path links get too long which you can change
    that setting and say that's we don't need to do that anymore but this ZIP file
    had long file name so that's what the error was is like these pads are too long
    um so this 7z is a different form of zip that doesn't have that error so if you
    want to see where things were last week this one is the one that's up to date
    to that one this one uh was from this morning um and so if you download this unzip
    it it will still throw two errors um saying the p pkl and Json files are unhappy
    but just

  text: skip those and unpack the rest of it and try to open it up in obsidian and
    hopefully by the time you get to that point I will have gotten to that point in
    my conversation so give that a shot see how far you get um so the yeah so a lot
    of the stuff we've been doing up until now has been on the kind of like data and
    computational side of things so the the topic of the course is neural control
    of real world human movement and uh we're going to talk and so and so we've been
    focusing more up to this point on like basic methods and sort of like the kinds
    of data that you can collect and sort of the measurements that you can take and
    a little bit into the sort of more um I'll say like high theory side of things
    um so all the talk about full body Center of mass and sort of those like base
    level physics and sort of hyper simplified models of the body and sort of it moves
    around the world is all kind all of those things are kind of um about the study
    of it's more about the study of the neural control of real world human movement
    on the it basically focusing on the um like the kinds of measurements you can
    take like the the empirical investigation sort of like conversations there to
    pertaining um and we're going to go back into that methods Z stuff when we talk
    about Vision when sort of bring out the ey tracker and do sort of more data looking
    um but today I want to give more of a sort of focusing more on like the the landscape
    of um neur what we think about neural control and what we think about motor control
    this is something that I have I found myself when I was sort of going around in
    the conversations at the end at the last parts of previous classes something I
    sort of found myself referring back to a lot so it's not directly on the presume
    syllabus um but I want to talk today about uh the concept of the motor hierarchy
    as it pertains to the neural control of movement because it's one of those things
    where it's like it's a very fundamental aspect of our the our neural motor systems
    that it is arranged in this sort of hierarchical way um with the cortex and sort
    of the lumpy pink thing on top at the top of the hierarchy and then going down
    to the various sort of subcortical systems and spinal cord and muscles and sort
    of at the bottom of that hierarchy would be what you might consider like the base
    level physics of the world um and so we're going to talk about that uh but we're
    not going to do particularly deep dives into any aspect of it um because I want
    to give enough time for us to do more of the kind of splitting off into groups
    and doing our own Explorations this time we're going to we're going to do a little
    bit more clumping by presumed topic as we chop up

  start: 360.0
  text: the room into sort of like which part of this hierarchy do we want to talk
    about today and then the idea is to sort of try to use your Collective efforts
    to flesh out parts of the brief overview brief fast dense overview that I'm going
    to give in a second here so um we'll get to that in a second so um yeah uh so
    this kind of exploration of like you know y'all doing some of the work of helping
    to flesh out the landscape we've been playing with it a little bit with sort of
    talking to the bot and sort of asking it questions about your own presumed interests
    and um and as the semester has progressed I've made more progress into basically
    updating the code that I have been using to scrape those conversations out of
    the server and then put them into the a not not the bot but just another sort
    of like configuration of AI stuff um and basically asking a different llm configuration
    to pull out the topics that y'all have been asking about in order to get sort
    of a landscape of the topics that you have been interested in uh so in order to
    look at that uh yeah so on the assumption that you have downloaded the zip file
    uh and extracted it if you're on a Mac it'll look a little bit different but at
    this point in your life I assume you know how to unzip things if you don't ask
    a neighbor if your neighbor doesn't know just chill out and ask me later um but
    so you want to download it extract it and and this always gets creaky when I come
    on yeah and then extract it so it's just like a regular old folder in here uh
    just anywhere on your computer and then uh you should have at some point downloaded
    obsidian um obsidian MD just search for it it's a free software and when you so
    uh get it download it double click it it will look a little bit different the
    first time you open it but uh so weird did I do that on this computer yet I can't
    remember um and what you'll want to do is so for me it's down here again if you're
    on a Mac it might look a little different but uh you're going to want to

    or I think if you do like probably control o it might give you a screen that looks
    something like this um and the option that you want is called open folder as Vault
    uh obsid just calls folders vaults for whatever reason um so open that and navigate
    to the folder that you just extracted uh there's a bunch of like unnecessary subfolders
    in that zip file which I figured out this morning um it doesn't matter which one
    you pick uh but just to make it a little bit cleaner I'm going to click in through
    top level into AI processed um This Server scrapes is just the raw data so it's
    effectively the the MD markdown file that's that's attached to the top of each
    chat this is basically a folder full of those things with the F with sort of laid
    out in a similar structure to the server so I'm just going to click through that
    into AI processed and then this is the stuff for the not necessar way too many
    stuff in there uh so I'm in here and uh you will notice that these folder names
    correspond to the same categories that we have in the actual server and then if
    you click into that these will correspond to the names of the so that's in topics
    vision and then it's got the same names as all the the channels and then where'd
    it go oh I'm getting distracted as I often do okay so in here I'm GNA select this
    folder let obsidian open it up it's white for some reason I don't know why it
    decided to be light mode for me but that's fine enough for now and so there's
    a lot of stuff in here and basically if you click through this every so in now
    in addition to the the raw conversation which is attached to the bottom and you
    got links here if you click on the link it'll take you to that message in the
    server probably on the browser version of the server and then up here is sort
    of an extracted summary of the topics covered in this conversation which was presumably
    about it tracking and VR whoever it was that had that conversation um and there's
    a lot of like art to how to figure out like sort of the right way to tell and
    LM to chew on a Big Blob of text in order to pull out topics um but in this particular
    case I was mostly focused on just
- dur: 180.0
  end: 900.0
  start: 720.0
  text: getting raw topics covered um so I gave it this structure of like you know
    pull out a title a extremely short summary highlights a very short summary a short
    summary and a detailed summary sort of like different levels of abstraction um
    you know to sort of make that do its thing and then importantly uh I also added
    pull out tags so these tags are just sort of hashtag uh this is called Kebab case
    because it's a dash it's lowercase numbers with little strings between them or
    uh hyphens between them and what the tags allow us to do is click on this little
    graph view thing over here and that gives us this fun thing here um so these dots
    are all of the so each one of these dots corresponds to one of the chats that
    was had and if we go over to filters and turn on tags these are all the tags that
    were covered um and so there's a couple thing to to note here first of all this
    is fun I love this type of thing uh and I think I can you could there's a lot
    of options for the display I don't know why it's in light mode but that's fine
    um let the text be a little there let the nodes be a little smaller ones be a
    little less thick um and so you can sort of navigate around in here the green
    ones are the tags and the black ones are the notes um this is the kind of thing
    like I don't want to belabor this particular Point too deeply and sort of get
    too hard into the the technical aspects of like how to use this type of stuff
    obsidian is nice because there's a lot of tutorials and stuff so if you're curious
    about how to take notes like this and sort of have your general notes that you're
    taking in your life have this sort of like nice internalized structure um just
    hop on YouTube and search for obsidian and you'll find lots of good stuff there
    um but the basic idea is so there's like certain tags so like biomechanics can
    I do it doesn't really help much but that's okay um so we've been doing so this
    is the biome mechanics tag so we've been doing a lot of talking about the biomechanics
    of the situation so unsurprisingly um that tag is present in a lot of your conversations
    and so if I click on that it will show me all of the tags that have been discussed
    and so you can look up uh let's say impact of knee injuries on biomechanics and
    so I click on there and this is a conversation that one of Y all had about about
    knee injuries and

  text: biomechanics and this is what was discussed in there and you can click on
    this and it will I take gu tap to the server version or the online browser version
    has to load up uh yeah so this was Grace if you're in here um where'd you go yeah
    wait is that the right one wait no it's a different thing yeah um yeah so biomechanic
    is very well connected uh straight Neuroscience is obviously well connected uh
    neural control is well connected um there's also come some like uh like orphans
    out here that are not connected so mathematical ambiguity and interpretations
    sometimes these are caused by like just like a conversation that's like super
    short so it's not there's not much content there but AI has like people pleaser
    energy so if you tell it to summarize something that only has like someone saying
    hello and then nothing else it will still try to come up with the full summary
    even though that's not valid to do um and in this particular case someone was
    asking yeah mathematics or of operations something that that oh actually no remember
    how I told you that I was not going to scrape the playground Channel um I lied
    it is in here because it's easier to not it's easier to just not ignore it so
    there are occasionally some of these that are like it's doing its best to pull
    a reasonable summary out of a conversation that is intentionally misleading um
    so uh okay and so I'm going to leave that roughly there um feel free to I guess
    another thing to say is you'll notice too that a lot of these tags are like not
    they're like they're orphan tax right these this is being included only in one
    conversation this thing sods is something that would probably be it'll probably
    be connected more once we finish talking about eye movements um but some of these
    two like trust right that the trust doesn't need to be a tag in this class and
    so that's something the way that I wrote The Prompt or I didn't do any cleanup
    after the fact it just pulled stuff that really shouldn't be there um brain computer
    interfaces probably should be in there um seeds in body someone was talking about
    eating plants I remember that that was a yeah um like there's some things here
    where you can kind of tell that like the way that it is extracted the information
    makes it more actually didn't do a terrible job this time but yeah so Consciousness
- dur: 180.0
  end: 1260.0
  start: 1080.0
  text: variations like that should that tag should really be Consciousness and then
    anyone else who talked about that which I know there's at least a couple of you
    would get matched in there um you know so this is the case where like the way
    that the bot extracted the tags if that was done more sort of skillfully or carefully
    it would be a more connected um system of topics and content um so some of that
    is about having like more conversations to get more connection some it's about
    like making the prompt a little better and then anytime you're doing anything
    with AI and language generation there's always needs to be kind of like a human
    cleanup step so you know I could go through and clean this up I could ask you
    to clean it up um and maybe we'll do that uh we're going to be using musicin money
    what are you talking about uh yeah so figuring out how to like EXP this stuff
    like y'all can jump in there and look at what your classmates have been talking
    about um we're going to be doing in the latter part of the class sort of a little
    bit more toward in the direction of um y'all producing more like curated Blobs
    of text that are sort of designed to help pull together some of these disparate
    disconnected things um and I will be continuing over the course of the semester
    to sort of increase the sophistication of this extract action um and the idea
    is to sort of find a way to let all of you kind of like have the ways that you
    have been exploring this topic and the space um cohere into a sort of a a navigable
    landscape of this sort of comedically vast topic um yeah so yeah and then I I
    told it I tried to get it not to do this I told it like don't use names but this
    one's like this topic is about Caroline's interest in human anatomy and surgery
    it's like that should not that's the bad that's a bad title there but uh it's
    not Carolyn's fault that's just the way like being more careful with the prompting
    to like make sure that it doesn't do that stuff and keeping the style consistent
    because um I also just to make it run fast and cheap I this one was was processed
    by GPT 3.5 um who is dumber than G 3.4 or GPT 4 and the latter ones um but it
    is also like very very very fast and like effectively free at this point so with
    this thing we're we're processing high enough volume of text that the cost becomes
    noticeable if you use the the bigger stuff and if if you use the the bigger models
    it would take you know half an hour to an hour or more to process all these things
    where it's with 3.5 it's effectively free and processes in like 30 seconds as
    opposed to like 30 minutes so um and for stuff like

  text: extracting summaries it's sort of smart enough for that that's what language
    natural language processing has been doing that for like 20 years um but you do
    kind of get like some Dum dumb Behavior where it's like that's not even the right
    capitalization there okay cool so um yeah so makees sense uh great if it doesn't
    make sense also fine um if you have technical issues getting it running and sort
    of getting the point where you can look at it we'll handle that in a little bit
    here um but yeah there's no real obligations for you with this side of class right
    now this is more of a I am giving you updates on my homework and this is where
    we're at with it because real work is typically speaking iterative in nature um
    okay so uh so this is the place where if I had successfully pushed my notes to
    the to GitHub I'm that would be looking at them right now um but they weren't
    particularly extensive anyway um so I'll take this as an opportunity to like show
    a little bit about how bot work um so with something like you know like I'm giving
    an undergraduate lecture on the motor hierarchy the neural motor hierarchy in
    your nervous system that is such a well-trod topic that's like sort of intro level
    to any any class that talks about motor Neuroscience is going to talk about the
    motor hierarchy so if I ask the bot to say give me a lecture outline for the motor
    uh motor hierarchy hierarchy um it'll give me something good especially because
    it already has the syllabus of the class kind of baked into it with that sort
    of the top level prompt um I have this other sort of yeah see perfect um uh I
    had this other sort of Channel over here where I just I use AI for my own purposes
    um which you can make your own as well if you want but we'll talk about that later
    or maybe not um and so in that server uh if I wanted to because it isn't prompted
    in the same way that this class is if I gave it that simple of a of a Preamble
    it wouldn't do
- dur: 180.0
  end: 1620.0
  start: 1440.0
  text: as good of a job um but because this one is already in the context of like
    having the syllabus of the server the class already baked into itself um it does
    a decent job um oh uh give me the order from highest to lowest uh because it did
    that the other way um great um so so there you go now you have everything you
    need to know about the motor hierarchy not really um this kind of a thing and
    uh uh give me an additional outline about the corticos spinal corticospinal tract
    um yeah so that's another sort of area I wonder if it didn't mention that in the
    original yeah it did mention it briefly but that's this is another kind of thing
    so like when you're when you're navigating this kind of like AI mediated language
    space there's often kind of a a balance you want to you want to strike between
    like what I think of is like top down versus bottom up types of in investigations
    so where a bottomup approach is kind of like giving it a very loose instruction
    set and just saying just seeing what it pops out at you so like tell me about
    neuroscience and it'll like give you a broad scoped thing um versus more of a
    top down approach which is where you as the human uh give it more structure and
    you say no give me more specifically this this type of thing um and it you get
    different responses that way and they're both they both can be quite useful so
    the analogy and this is a sort of recurring theme when working with AI is often
    times the the strategies that work well with AI are also kind of like sort of
    Funhouse versions of things that just generally work when you're talking to humans
    um if for no other reasons then it was trained on human data um so like in this
    course when we started you know I said hey go have an introductory talk ask the
    bot about whatever you want um that's a very bottomup approach so I'm just saying
    hey room full of people ask this thing a bunch of questions just based on whatever
    you are interested in talking about and so when I do that and so a lot of the
    early part of this class sort of had that structure um the ones that are kind
    of driven by uh lectures a little more structured but a lot of the conversations
    so far have been very bottom up and this um meaning that I am not imposing a structure
    from the top down and so the like the topics that are covered and that sort of
    graph that was shown is sort of a result of kind of that bottom up type of approach
    um if I

  start: 1620.0
  text: were to and so like I guess in contrast if we think about like the kind of
    conversations that happened in this channel where this was the one that happened
    after the uh the center of mass basis support lecture last time this is and I
    said hey now ask the now ask the bot questions have conversations about this lecture
    that's that's sort of it's more structured um but it's still fairly open um which
    and then that would be contrasted with like saying you know write a class write
    a paper about this topic so when you're working with AI and you're trying to sort
    of steer it and you're trying to you make it generate something that you feel
    like has some relationship to like your internal State like something that you
    are trying to bring out into the world um it's often very beneficial to sort of
    swap back and forth between these two modes of thinking so at saying hey give
    me an outline of this topic without a bunch of structure to it and then taking
    that structure that it gives you cleaning it up altering it editing it um and
    then giving it back and say hey give me some more give me some information about
    this outline flesh out this outline um and often times it's not even worth doing
    that first step if you already know what you're interested in just ask it specific
    questions and you'll get specific answers so it's sort of a there's just like
    different modes of using this thing and I thing I've mentioned a lot is sort of
    like I think one of the best things that these AIS are really good for is helping
    you flesh out your unknown unknowns like you know you have an interest in a topic
    but you don't even know enough to know the parts that you have questions about
    so just ask it generally tell me more about this and it'll give you a bunch of
    stuff and then you'll say I didn't even know what these words are and then ask
    about those words and you kind of navigate it that way um but you also want to
    be able to like drive the conversation a bit um anyway so I mostly asked to give
    me this just to have a uh a cheat sheet of the actual Parts I wanted to talk about
    I always have to do this right okay so do it like that can I do this I guess I
    can do that like that this is the part where I get mad at Discord for poor use
    of space

  text: okay so um the motor hierarchy broadly speaking uh corresponds to the basically
    the the organization of responsibilities that within your motor cortex your motor
    sorry not your motor system um from the high level abstract sort of thoughts of
    things like I'm thirsty I wish I had water uh I'm hungry I want to eat um very
    abstract thoughts down to the level of like I am trying to put Force into the
    world so that I can move my body in the direction of water in the direction of
    food um and the ways that we kind of like the way that like like the needs of
    like in order to complete a given task you have to have a combination of those
    different levels because if you're only thinking about the motor system as like
    a thing that's attached to your muscles that that puts forces into the world in
    order to like pick up objects and push on the ground and do things like that um
    you're never actually going to get like coordinated Behavior as you're moving
    in the direction of goals and stuff like that at the same time if you're only
    thinking about stuff in the context of like high order volitional desires of you
    know I prefer Fruit to to wheat um like I'm I get thirsty when I talk a lot or
    something like that um then you're not going to have the kind of like goal- driven
    behaviors that actually make uh coordinated movement actually like meaningful
    and produce actual results um so I want to can I zoom in here yeah sure so again
    and I I think I did a picture kind of like this at the beginning but I'm just
    going to try to give you more of like an atlas of these parts and how they connect
    to each other and then work together on like fleshing out the details and specifically
    today I want you guys to start use like looking at papers and looking up papers
    on these topics and then using the bot to help you like chew on some of the the
    deeper stuff there so again moving away from like asking the raw AI to tell you
    sort of textbook level stories about you know highle stuff basically like if Wikipedia
    could talk and start using it more as like a tool that you can use to navigate
    Waters that are deeper than you can navigate on your own uh so let's start with
    the brain so first thing you got to do is draw a brain do it roughly like that
    it's a brain um specifically that's a mamalian brain malean

  text: brain yeah so this is not a brain someone asked an AI to draw a brain for
    them that's not what a brain looks like this is an inside of a brain um yeah where
    are the pictures I'm looking for they roughly similar but the main the main part
    that I try to draw when I'm just doing that sketch is this part right here is
    the that lumpy part going down that's your temporal lobe by your temple um and
    then the rest is kind of squiggly it's I mentioned this before but like you eventually
    start to learn that like all these little like squishes and folds and stuff like
    that they all have names um and they're not random and you can kind of start to
    when you see brains in popular media if it was based off of an actual brain or
    if it's just someone who just like it's just a bunch of squishy red stuff oh yeah
    this is the picture I was looking for so it's all a little bit different they're
    all rough they're not shaped all the same but they all have this see this is not
    a real brain they're missing some important parts which is not great for a actual
    part there but that's fine um and this is a this is a object of pure horror so
    so your so there you go you got the your this is your temporal lobe and then this
    stuff up here is the front uh give yourself some eyeballs and that sort of goes

    we tend to put things point the other way but that's okay uh I always I always
    I don't know I was raised speaking Arabic so I learn sometimes right to left comes
    more naturally and I was like I don't know if that's actually normal um or if
    that's just I don't know who cares um so don't put that one up let's put something
    like this one let's give us a proper actual brain please oh yeah there we go so
    this frontal lobe here um is all mammals have it I don't want we're really going
    to talk about Mamon brains here because I don't know how any of the rest of them
    work um birds in particular I'm very curious about but they can be very intelligent
    with very strange with very different nervous systems and I don't know much about
    that um but but the the frontal lobe is sort of like the

  text: traditionally most human part there's a lot of parts of our brain that are
    quite different from other animals um it's often just in terms of like the raw
    volume um but particularly when you start going into like you know the the our
    Dumber mammal friends like your cats and your your your rats and whatnot the biggest
    differences tend to be a lack of that very pronounced bulbous frontal lobe and
    where is that stupid thing oh there it is um and so this part here is also roughly
    speaking generally speaking the very top of the motor hierarchy is that frontal
    lobe executive function um and yeah and so typically speaking and anytime someone's
    giving you any kind of specific words about how the brain works please understand
    it is a cartoon version of reality and reality is always weirder more abstract
    and less understood than anything anyone could ever say while standing in a space
    talking to you in a room um but generally speaking it is thought that like that
    is where your sort of your volitional control comes from volition is like roote
    of voluntary it's like the voluntary aspects of things like I want to pick up
    this box and so I will pick up this box that that initial desire is the volitional
    aspect of things and that is sort of you know cartoon wise thought to sort of
    originate here in the prefrontal cortex you know frontal prefrontal cortex um
    and the yeah so that's where those sort of like the most abstract form of your
    motor desires originate in that sort of frontal lobe area um this is where the
    the the description of the content of the neural activity or the patterns of neural
    activity that we call motor control there um is abstract to the point of not even
    really referencing the body like it's sort of like I I wish I had water um I wish
    I had food or something like that um and yeah and so that again cartoon wise is
    sort of passed back through like yeah frontal prefrontal premotor motor um and
    then this part here sort of like on either side of your head is the part we traditionally
    call the primary motor cortex which will look something

  text: like this is the part that tends not get drawn yeah there we go that's what
    I was for before um again cartoon versions of reality has not it's not based on
    nothing there's a reason why we draw this cartoon and not some other cartoon um
    but nothing is this clean um and the basic trajectory is that the those original
    highle volitional aspects of control are sort of they get passed through different
    sub regions of that of that brain um you're this part is sort of roughly your
    premotor cortex which sort of starts to get more specific and then by the time
    you get to the motor cortex that's where things are thought to start having a
    resemblance to your body so you have this is again another this is the kind of
    picture that you will see in a lot of textbooks about Neuroscience you may have
    seen it before um it's also the kind of thing that you will never see in a talk
    about motor cortex this is the kind of thing where this picture of so this is
    sort of the idea that like you know different parts of your brain handle the movement
    of different parts of your body and so you get this very over representation of
    things like your hands which has a lot of motor control associated with it and
    much less representation of things like your hip and leg which are sort of more
    simplified um and then you know over representation of things like the face because
    we do things like talking and so the idea is that the you know again this the
    cartoon version of the story is that the highlevel desires to like you know grab
    a cup of water something like that gets passed through to the lower from the high
    level at the frontal loes and then passed through to the sort of more specific
    areas of the motor cortex and then translated into sort of a more body mapped
    um description of like how to move from one place to the other um and that is
    there's this horrible little man uh sensory motor homunculus that sometimes gets
    drawn as the this is what you look like on the inside this is your your your body
    map of yourself this is basically your body well not necessarily yours but um
    mapped to the sort of the uh the cortical magnification of the different parts
    of your movement this is uh clearly the sensory uh homunculus if you can't figure
    out why that's a lesson to the reader um but the the idea is that if you were
    to map out your like motor

    like um however this is also the kind of thing as I mentioned that yeah and this
    so there's the sensory C this the the motor cortex is sort of very close to the
    Sens the somata sensory cortex which is sort of like the sensory aspect of things
    so in the same way that we would you know move our elbows wrists and hands we
    also have Sensations from those areas and they are sort of right next to each
    other um but again I have seen many many talks from many many people often on
    the topic who study things like motor control and sensory motor control and the
    topic of those talks is typically trying to say please stop showing this to students
    it is not an accurate representation of reality um but then and then they say
    a bunch of much much more complicated stuff about how it's not really how it is
    but it it it's it's this is the easiest way to discuss things like cortical magnification
    at the motor and sensory levels um just understand that it is not a nice clear
    clean map it is not a the type of thing like oh here's where your wrist is here's
    where your hand is it's much more complex it's much more spread out it's much
    less organized um but if you sort of zoom out and squint and turn your head this
    cartoon version of reality is a good place to start this is also the kind of thing
    where if you wanted to look up more recent papers about the structure and organization
    of the motor cortex sensory motor cortex you'll find a lot of good stuff people
    actually doing that work it's also the kind of thing where if you ask the bot
    to tell you about this it will probably it will probably tell you this part and
    you might have to push it to be like is that really what people think and it might
    be like uh I actually don't know what it would do I think that is getting to the
    level of specificity and contemporariness of research where the fact that the
    bot has eaten every textbook might make it harder for it to deviate from the cartoonized
    version of reality that we tend to put into textbooks so this would be a if you
    wanted to sort of try to push the bot Until It Breaks um you might try to find
    a more recent paper on this topic and then find places where the bot gives you
    stuff that is not actually aligned with what we think in reality um just kind
    of had a brief moment of thinking about how that relates to things like Wikipedia
    but I think Wikipedia is famously fast so Wikipedia tends not to sort of hold
    on to wrong thoughts for very long so I think Wikipedia would probably give you
    like quicker and director sort of summary overviews of more modern thinking um
    but I'm actually not sure that's one of those spots so anyways so motor hierarchy
    so here we are we're starting in the frontal frontal cortex we going back to the

    kind of like sense of like this chunk of the brain is for sensory information
    and then this chunk is for like high level thoughts and abstraction and motor

    know for more like like memory and sort of more like contentful thinking but I
    don't know much about that but that's why I don't know about why but like the
    motor cortex being here and the samat cortex being there the way that I can remember
    that is because the samat cortex is closer to the visual cortex because that's
    like the vision side of things which only helps if you know where the visual cortex
    is but they are they sort of meet here um and I'm going to I'm going to continue
    the story but just so you know from this juncture is there's also a path that
    says uh that sort of bypasses the route that I'm about to tell you that things
    tend to go so we started out saying hey I wish I had water that gets sort of trundle
    along and gets converted into something like a motor plan in the motor cortex
    that says oh hey there's there's water right there and I let's assume I don't
    care about the fact that it's not mine I could reach out and grab that which would
    require taking a couple steps moving my arm out and sort of grabbing the thing
    um not withstanding the complexity of the fact that there was steps involved so
    that's sort of that's a whole other conversation um and I think that's also where
    a lot of the the question marks in the in the research live right now is like
    what happens when you have a motor plan that needs to sort of evolve over time
    like I need to walk over there and then do a behavior that's I think a do an area
    of Neuroscience that we really don't know as much about um and that's where the
    specific tagline of this course being about the neural control of human movement
    in the real world is where it starts to touch parts of Neuroscience that we just
    we just don't really know much about because if you think about the methods involved
    the vast vast vast majority of Neuroscience research psych psychological research
    is done of people sitting in chairs doing stuff on a tabletop doing single joint
    movements and our ability to measure the neural activity of humans in general
    but animals specific like animals at all moving around in a in a space while also
    recording the brain is uh we basically can't we we can start to we have we have
    been starting to be able to do that over the past like decade or so but still
    a lot of the theories that we have are based on Research that does not involve
    the animals being able to like move through the world and actually sort of have

    might find people who are working on those questions so all of this is happening
    in the cortex right the big lumpy pink thing on the top um and there's a bunch
    of other stuff that we tend to call that sort of a lot of other parts of your
    central nervous system that we lump together Under The Heading of subcortical
    regions um and personal favorite is the cerebellum which is this sort of lumpy
    part down there um cerebellum cerebellum little brain great um but and I'm going
    to talk about that in just a second but there's another component that I want
    to at least mention honorable mentions of a a particular piece that sort of lives
    in the middle we're doing a side view all these parts are D are doubled um on
    either side and for some reason your left side control the left side of your brain
    controls the right side of your body don't ask me why just how we evolved um but
    there is this very important part called the basil ganglia um and this is particularly
    interesting for those of y'all that are interested in things like movement disorders
    um because it's a part that can go wrong in various interesting ways um because
    the idea is that when you have this when you have that high level thought of like
    I want to be I wish I was holding this this box and I'm sitting here and I'm looking
    at the Box there's a lot of different ways that my body could solve that problem
    I could grab it with my dominant hand I could grab it with my non-dominant hand
    I could grab it with my dominant hand in a weird way I could move over here and
    grab it with my dominant hand all of these are options that would satisfy that
    highle volitional desire to be holding this box in my hand and so with any kind
    of a network so we we often talk about the brain in this kind of like serial processing
    kind of like computer analogy this is in line with our general approach of just
    humans a general approach of always describing the nervous system in the context
    of the most advanced piece of technology that we have if you go back through history
    we tend to always do that um uh so anytime you're talking about a network it the
    thinking is and again this is deep into the cartoon version of stories that when
    I have the desire to pick up a certain object or pick up a pen or whatever um
    the motor Network components that would generate

  text: that action all get activated a little bit and they get activated to the point
    and they're sort and then they they engage in a kind of like competition with
    each other um motor plan competition I think is a term you could look up for that
    um and but it wouldn't really work if every time I had a thought all the possible
    options to make that thing happen were activated at the same time um so that's
    where the this little Superior calculous guy his presumed cartoonized role is
    to suppress your motor commands until they reach a certain threshold of activation
    and in this very abstract sense the the best motor command wins out and then that
    one crosses the threshold and then that's the the one that gets triggered and
    actually moves through so in this case it's closest to my dominant hand I like
    using my dominant hand this is a com a comfortable strategy this is a not comfortable
    strategy so this motor command wins the fight between all the possible ways I
    could solve that problem and that's the one that occurs um and there are and there's
    you can talk for days about the details there the substantial Niagara and blah
    blah blah um but the point I wanted to to to point out here is that there are
    at least two ways that that process could go wrong um one process one way is that
    the the the gating like this the suppression that the superior click list does
    can be too strong to the point where none of those commands actually make it through
    the gate and I'm sitting here wanting to move but I I can't actually initiate
    the action um and that way of things going wrong is typically what happens in
    things like Parkinson's disease uh one of the Parkinson is complicated but one
    of the family of symptoms is things like freezing um freezing in Gate freezing
    in motor command and people sort of they they see what they want to do and they
    can't initiate the action and that is thought to be related to the superior calculus
    sort of gaing the problem too hard so none of the available motor commands are
    able to sort of trip trip over the the the gate and actually make the in things
    initialize um and there's interesting stuff there um another way that that can
    go wrong is the thing I said before of like it would be bad if all the motor commands
    happened all at once um and that's another thing that can happen in um specifically
    in a disease called Huntington's disease which is a uh famously um famously genetically
    predictable motor disease um it's like one of these things like it's very heritable

    so if one of your parents has Huntington's disease you have a 25% chance of having
    Huntington's disease and like we can just look at your genome and be like oh yeah
    you got it or oh yeah you don't so it's a sort of socially horrible thing and
    there's like I think there's like episodes of like house or things where it's
    like like what are the ethics of of a having a kid if you know there's a 25% they're
    going to have this degenerative disorder and B um what are the ethics of checking
    if you have it you know and if you get some assay of tests it may happen that
    the doctors just know the answer to whether or not you are going to have a degenerative
    M of disorder later in your life and so you know all sorts of not so fun conversations
    there um but people with Huntington disease exhibit Behavior where they basically
    have like movements that they didn't really intend to initiate that sort of make
    it over the hump um before they were able to be sort of stopped um and that's
    where you get Strange Behaviors where like if you show if you hold um like a cup
    with a handle in front of somebody who has things like Huntington's disease they
    have a very hard time not reaching out and grabbing it um because they they they
    see it they see the possibility of grabbing it and their Superior cus or whatever
    span cartoons whatever is not able to suppress that behavior so they they just
    reach out and grab things that they weren't intending to um so anyways there's
    a lot more going on in there but I did want to mention that just because I know
    that there's a general good chunk of ypre Ed so a good chunk of y'all are interested
    in movement disorders and a lot of movement disorders tend to live in in and around
    that that area um anyway so once those motor but once the motor Comm has been
    connected or sort of chosen or selected or sort of made it over that hump that's
    where there's there's a Cascade of activations that sort of happen from that point
    and generally speaking that will then sort of leave the brain and sort of first
    well I don't know about first but uh it will sort of get into the cerebellum and
    then into the brain stem and then into the spinal cord um cerebellum very complicated
    thing very complex thing uh roughly 3.5 as many 3.5 times as many neurons in your
    cerebellum as there are in the rest of your central nervous system combined um

    for this is the kind of thing you win a the you win Nobel prizes for pictures
    like that um back in you know 1800s um but these are the type of neurons that
    you get this might actually be in your motor cortex but these like highly highly
    uh synaptic like like massive synaptic for Forest where the output of the neuron
    whether or not it's spiking is dependent on this massive Network of connection
    to other parts of your body um or other parts of your nervous system um versus
    more yeah anyways um your cerebellum is thought to be the area that sort of handles
    things like motor coordination um and that's coordination that happens at different
    levels like most of your nervous system there sort of an inside out structure
    where the the inner parts of your cerebellum like the inner parts of your brain
    is the most phenic ancient is the oldest part and as you sort of go outwards you
    get more and more evolutionarily new stuff um until you get out to the the neocerebellum
    which is the outer this it looks like a lump but it's kind of folded up and on
    itself um and the neoc serums on the outside and that's the part that's thought
    to be associated with things like tool use and the fact that I can pick up an
    object that's not a part of my body and sort of like wave it around and then oh
    yeah now I sort of like internalized some of the physics of this thing and that
    ability to internalize the physics and sort of utilize external objects as if
    they were a part of my body is thought to be related to the neocerebellum and
    there's some interesting studies and fmri where they have people like playing
    with tools and stuff like that um and I always get like stuck on these little
    side quests because there I just have to tell the story because it's so interesting
    um not all animals can use tools obviously um but they there's a concept in Neuroscience
    called your Perry personal space and we tend to chop up the world into spots and
    you know out there that's like far away stuff um in here this is like like this
    is my actual body part and then there's the peripersonal space which is like

    space and if you take a monkey like a MAAC monkey a non-human primate one of the
    fews that we study and you can get certain so you can Le you can leion the brain
    in various ways and you get various types of blindness um and it's possible to
    get a type with a particular damage in a particular area um actually don't know
    that level um you can get a blindness in peripersonal space so you basically there's
    just like you can't see things that are sort of within a certain range of you
    and they there's a crazy study um where they they took a MAA and they were able
    to give it like a reversible lesion so they it's like they put uh chemical in
    that part of the brain so it just stops working for a little while but then after
    a while it comes back and they trained the monkey to use a grabber like a grabber
    thing to like reach out and grab things that are farther away than their arms
    reach and after the monkey was trained in using the Grabber arm and they did the
    cortical Legion the their peripersonal space extended to include the regions that
    they could reach with the Grabber so there's just this strange implication of
    like how we tend to view the world and how we tend to char carve it up into like
    things that are me things that are not me and then things that I can directly
    manipulate and for certain types of mammals um that that that question of like
    what is what part of the world is my body and what part of the world can I interact
    with my body includes things like tools it includes things that are not necessarily
    part of the raw biology which is just gets into the philosophy of things especially
    when we start extending the concept of tools away from things like Grabbers and
    Hammers and you know sharp pointy rocks and into things like laptops and the internet
    and large language models like these are all these things like we tend to really
    prioritize like the meat wear um and do things like make you take tests on pen
    and paper even though who gives a about what you can like recall under um but
    there's a whole concept of like embodied cognition which sort of tries to extend
    that notion that like we really are like ourselves plus our tool set plus you
    know our community of people who can help us with things and that's anyways gets
    complicated and philosophical very quickly um so yeah and then the lower parts

    tends to move you towards like the fetal position extension tends to move you
    opposite of that and in order for a movement to be smooth those things like the
    flexor extensor groups have to fire in a very tight temporal Loop um and if you
    if they misfire then you get again kind of like Behavior kind of like you know
    I hate doing like I hate simulating it because it sort of feels weird but like
    you can imagine sort of like seeing people with movement disorders they have this
    kind of like jerky movements um that can be it can come from a lot of different
    places but it can be associated with basically like misfiring where you're like
    if I'm extending my arm then my flexor of my then the tricep should be um engaging
    and the bicep should be loose but if my biceps kept firing while I'm trying to
    extend my arm then you get this kind of like jerkier behavior um and that's coupled
    with like uh another type of disorder which can have which can lead to sort of
    what they call like the drunkard's wobble like when you're like where you sort
    of like it's more of a swim or type of thing where it's like this is where like
    my my postural control system is firing but it's like slow so you get this kind
    of like more of a soupy type of movement so those are all just different parts
    of the Cascade of things that can go wrong in the motor system um cell taxia is
    one of those terms you can look up anyway um so yeah that's cerebellum uh your
    your brain stem is kind of hanging out here brain stem is honestly a part that
    I know least about it's it's sort of a level below the cerebellum it sort of has
    to do more with like um it's thought to be related to like like sensory integration
    um but it's kind of like in my understanding of this space I kind of like lump
    it in with like that that host of like very lowlevel Integrations between like
    that sort of like um like flexor extensor groups and like timing and you know
    like integration of sensory information where that sensory information mean like
    the forces that are happening at your joints less than like the visual information
    um so you know if you wanted to look up how the brain stem interacts with stuff
    then you could do that but I don't have as much information there um a part that

    aspects of uh your your motor control um your spinal cord spinal cord yeah there
    we go Wikipedia so your spinal cord doesn't go all the way down your spinal column
    spinal columns the the bone part um it stops around here so like right below your
    rib cage and then the rest is like um peripheral nerves that sort of go in and
    out to the actual inating the muscles um it flips inside out so your your your
    cortex has the the gray matter which is all the bodies of the neurons on the outside
    and all the the wires and the white matter which is like the gal cell wrapped
    things on the inside spinal cord flips that around so all the the goopy wiring
    stuff is on the outside side and this is sort of the this blue stuff here is the
    same gray matter that's on the outside of your cortex um and the kinds of I never
    have enough time to talk uh the uh like your your spine is that we're now getting
    down to like the very the very bottom of that motor hierarchy uh and the the kinds
    of controls you get at the spinal level are still definitely in the space of what
    we would call like processing um but they are there's there's very little abstraction
    if anything down there so that's where your spinal cord handles things like your
    reflexes um so like if you ever go to the doctor and they hit you on the knee
    and then it kicks your you hit you on the knee the tendon and it kicks your knee
    out um that they're testing your spinal reflexes and one of the most lowlevel
    ones is the monosynaptic stretch reflex which is if this muscle is stretched uh
    there is a refle there is a reflex that makes it contract it's sort of a protective
    thing so when you hit the tendon it stretches the muscle and then that goes up
    to the spine and the The Reflex there is if that muscle uh stretched then contract
    it and that's why you you kick out um however it's not as simple as just a sort
    of there's a reflex that's there and it's always there because if that reflex
    was always active then you wouldn't be able to do things like move your leg because

    of the locomoter gate cycle where when you're walking you're sort of going back
    and forth between each leg is sort of going back forth between stance phase where
    in stance phase you're weight you're holding the entire weight of your body on
    on a very stiff leg if you're running or something like that when you impact the
    ground you're impacting it with like 1.4 or more times your body weight so your
    leg has to be very stiff in that moment when it hit the ground someone I think
    asking about like like if you step off of a stair and you think there's going
    to be another stair there or there's one more one fewer stairs than than you expect
    you have that kind of like very unpleasant moment where the limb Was preparing
    for the ground that was not at the right level um so sorry so when you're stepping
    back and forth your legs are going back and forth between stance phase where all
    of your your reflexes are sort of cranked down to let your leg be very stiff and
    support your whole way to your body and then swing phase where they're all kind
    of turned off basically to let your leg be much more floppy and loose so it can
    swing through and basically utilize its own momentum and to allow it to sort of
    move forward um without having to like burn a bunch of muscles burn a bunch of
    energy like moving it directly and so that transition from like stance to swing
    phase which happens roughly every 450 milliseconds roughly a million times per
    year for a healthy undergraduate human um that transition is happening at the
    level of the spine and that the specifically the timing of transitioning from
    one to the other is handled by things called Central pattern generators which
    is where a lot of the basic rhythmicity of motor motor control comes from most
    of your motor system is rhythmic in nature so you're walking you're chewing you're
    scratching you're doing things that are kind of like have a rhythmic a rhythmic
    aspect to it um and that's kind of handled by these sort of central pattern generators
    but then where the hierarchy kind of comes in the sort of motor hierarchy tends
    to come in in order for the for movements to be graceful and coordinated and smooth
    they have to be appropriate for the world as it lays out so if I'm stepping up
    onto a a a step or stepping down at something or from you know interacting with
    the world um there is a supervenience that happens where the

  text: those high level volitions those high level desires attached coupled with
    like visual information sort of like sensory information both out in the world
    um gets translated into basically a set of instructions for how we should lay
    out the the reflexes and sort of you know how like like what the timing and the
    strength and the gains of all these reflexes should be in order to generate movements
    that are appropriate for the world that's around you so the idea is like that
    down here at the lowest level of the nervous system um these very very lowlevel
    things are happening on the basis of instruction sets that come from the top down
    but then if you but then also like the signals from the world also go in the other
    direction so there's this kind of like it's a it's a communication that's a two-way
    communication but it's not symmetric so it's sort of that's where the the concept
    of the hierarchy comes in um because the top tends it tends to be the top tends
    to tell the the top the high level stuff tends to tell a lowl stuff what to do
    but if the lowle stuff says oh wait no I actually hit something then if you're
    nervous the high level stuff will sort of take that into account and handle things
    appropriately um never never have time um I am just going to briefly mention so
    the the little story we've been telling now about hierarchy and things like that
    is a sort of the general again cartoonized version of the motor hierarchy and
    it tends to be um played out this tends to be how like mamalian nervous systems
    at least tend to be organized um I sort of skipped a aspect here of like muscle
    synergies of sort of like you know like my arm all the muscles in my arm are handled
    kind of like in conjunction with each other so I'm not doing things like controlling
    each muscle individually I'm not controlling each degree of Freedom individually
    um they're handle more at this what's called like a synergistic level and for
    most mammals that's what you get you get this kind of like the front the high
    level stuff sort of activates these like motor planes which activate these motor
    hierarchies and that's about where things tend to end however uh for a small subset
    of animals specifically tool using mammals um but I again I'm not sure like things
    like corvids and stuff play into this but we have like a freaky special other
    tract called the corticospinal tract where we have parts of the nervous system
    like that bypass all of this other stuff and kind of go down and directly innervate
    the spine so cortico spinal tract so cortex to spine and and again I think that's
    that's an area where like by basically by saying

  text: what I just said I'm I'm roughly exhausting my knowledge on the topic uh I
    think it's an area of very active research in terms of like which animals have
    a cortical spinal tract which mean which ones and which ones don't like I think
    it's with Biology it's never a case of like yes or no it's Al always a matter
    of degree but it is one of it's again one of those places that is thought to be
    related to our ability to be like magnificent adaptation engines where we can
    control our body and basically an arbitrary level of ways and sort of this very
    high level of precision and um find control is thought to be related to in addition
    to things like the neocortex which is handling this sort of like tool using stuff
    also the cortical spinal tract which is sort of giving like I think about things
    like learning like gymnastics and stuff like that where you're you're doing something
    and then someone says oh no no not like that like that like your your like your
    your H your heel is off by an inch and a half in this direction change the motor
    plan on the basis of like words that I'm saying to you and I think like when I
    like philosophically poetically think about the nervous system I think that it's
    that type of control that's being sort of implicated by in things like the cortical
    spinal track and stuff like that um CU I just think that like you know comparing
    human movement to other types of animal movement like one of the main questions
    of like what makes us different is related to our infinite adaptability relative
    to most other animals it's you know we'll talk a bit about that in the evolution
    phase of life um and that goes out to your limbs and does muscle stuff uh okay
    I that's about as quick as I can ever make anything I guess so anyways that's
    roughly speaking your nervous system at least the motor control parts of it um
    and I yeah obviously covered a lot of ground said a lot of things um and so for
    the rest of the class I guess I'll just let youall be like locally clumped at
    this point I I I might just have to have a whole classroom I don't know because
    it's like there's so much I want to say to you but I also want to give you time
    to explore on your own so we'll we'll figure that out um probably not time for
    code stuff this time around so um I will say let's do roughly like we did last
    time where we pop into a channel in the lectures area called 2024 10

  text: 15 uh motor hierarchy I don't know if I spelled hierarchy correctly but um
    this there you go doop perfect no questions um yeah and uh just kind of do what
    we did last time so so pop open some some chats and just ask it some questions
    and what I'll specifically ask you to do this time which I haven't done in the
    past is rather so follow your heart so if you wanted to ask sort of more of this
    kind of like highlevel like like give me the textbook version of the story go
    ahead and do that if you want to dive deeper into like the nittier grittier side
    of things where the the cartoons break down um ask the bot for keywords that you
    can punch punch into things like PubMed or Google Scholar and look for papers
    on the topic um that it's questioned for uh don't ask it for specific papers it
    will either give you papers that are old um or it will give you papers that don't
    exist uh SL chat um and uh so ask it for keywords and then go search for those
    those uh those papers you can ask for things like review articles but just ask
    it for keywords that you can search for and then when you find the paper copy
    the entire abstract and paste the abstract into the chat and then ask it to explain
    that to you um because obviously you could read the abstract and figure it out
    for yourself but abstracts are necessarily and intentionally extremely dense linguistic
    blobs so there's pretty much no abstract on the planet that you couldn't spend
    several lifetimes trying to parse out all of the details and all the words and
    all the unfamiliar phrases um and let's do that for Jesus Christ 13 minutes and
    uh yeah I'll say so I that's not much to get into so just I'm not going to make
    it an official assignment but like continue this conversation with the bot throughout
    the day and throughout the week just just like every so often just pop over in
    the chat and just ask it a question um you know I'm not going to necessarily make
    that assignment I'll make assignments later but like you know anytime you have
    a thought just pull it out and ask it the question um because I will be doing
    the scrape and pull stuff throughout the week and then you know I'll do it again
    before next week so if you want to have some ability to steer what that content
    is ask it questions about the things that you care about
