full_transcript: okay hello everybody settle down um so yeah welcome to this Bonus
  Week um thank you for showing up sort of the like so because this class doesn't
  have a class the first week of the semester because semester starts on Wednesday
  we it's like this like weird little half week is kind of part of that um so appreciate
  you showing up uh if you're watching this on a video we didn't show up I understand
  um and what was I going to say yeah so it's kind of the Cadence of the semester
  actually been working up pretty nicely so last time we got the had the fun little
  walk through of my prior research experience with sort of hypothetically sufficient
  background to cover it and now this is the second to final class of the semester
  and um yeah so it's kind of like a little bit of a bonus lecture um and so like
  I said so this time I'm going to talk about your autonomic nervous system and particularly
  as it relates to such things as trauma and the neurophysiological effects of trauma
  on the body and the sort of the ways that that kind of like interacts and overlaps
  with all the things we've been learning this semester about how bodies work and
  the weird balancing act that we have between like the parts of our bodies and nervous
  system that we have direct hypothetically direct FAL access and control in the parts
  that are kind of like the ocean that we float on top of and sort of like the ways
  that those things play in with each other um the so next week is going to be the
  final class of the semester there is no proper final so um I'm going to spend that
  time kind of doing wrapup and just presenting my class project of trying to make
  sense of the tremendous amount of you put into the server um I'll come up with some
  I the basic plan for I'll have like some kind of like a official assignment looking
  thing on canvas about like what to do to kind of wrap up your efforts here and I
  I'll probably I'll spend Thanksgiving kind of putting a couple little extra bells
  and whistles on the bot and sort of like some of the visualizations I've been showing
  throughout the semester um and then there'll be some kind of assignment like object
  that will look something like hey make sure you've had at least this many chats
  here and there and then a kind of like a an outro type of conversation where you'll
  had kind of a like an introductory aspect and so there's going to be kind of like
  an exit interview type of thing where you'll talk to the bot about at that point
  I will have with any luck a way of like extracting your specific conversations and
  sort of doping that into the conversation and then you can kind of like discuss
  with the bot about like the blah blah Blas of how the semester went and what you
  discovered and found and it'll be fun to look at um yeah so let's get into this
  so I dropped a link to the sort of the sloppy notes that I have on the GitHub page
  um and kind of try to go through this in as let's see what I'm trying to do here
  see that yeah sure why not that's fine yeah so going to try to just like run through
  a lot of this this was kind of um so this area of neuroscience at the sort of the
  autonomic level is not something that I have like direct professional experience
  in so a lot of the stuff we've been talking about this semester is on the kind of
  the perceptual motor side of life and um like eye movements and motion capture and
  that kind of biomechanic stuff and that is an area which I you know am a like contributing
  expert or whatever in that particular area of research so I have a uh you know I
  have the awareness of that field in this in the sense of like you know knowing the
  literature and also like understanding the methods and sort of like being very steeped
  in the culture of people who research that type of thing um this is getting closer
  and this is getting into areas that like I don't have that same relationship with
  um so it's stuff that I kind of know a lot about in various ways but the ways in
  which I know it is kind of like uh some like a strange Middle Ground between like
  what we might call what we often call like sort of the the concept of like an intelligent
  lay person which is someone who's not a professional expert in a particular field
  um but it's just kind of like a like a smart person who's like looked into it and
  read up read up about it um a lot of sort of scientific writing is sort of intentionally
  targeting that sort of intelligent lay person type of audience um so it's like I've
  read some books about it but I haven't like done deep research on it I've never
  done like direct uh research in the area um but it has this nice aspect because
  of my background that it all the sort of the Popular Science type of stuff I like
  to look into about it is connected to stuff that I do have that kind of deep knowledge
  of um so sort of you can like poke around and sort of like watch throughout the
  lecture about like the kind of the ways that like the stuff that we have been talking
  about kind of folds in and it's kind of interesting for me to kind of examine like
  the places where it feels like because I'm not in that area I'm sort of missing
  some things and other ways in which because I am kind of an outsider to some extent
  like a nearby Outsider that the unique perspectives that I have kind of like like
  oh that might actually be a contribution into that type of thing um so yeah let's
  kind of let's get into it um yeah and so um so let's talk about your various nervous
  systems uh you have one main one which is roughly speaking your entire body uh and
  then there's a SE there's several other kind of delineations of your nervous system
  and the ones that we've been talking about the most we tend to talk about the most
  in the field that we call Neuroscience is the central nervous system so the central
  nervous system is the sort of the thing that you tend to think about when you think
  about uh Neuroscience uh central nervous system um and specifically it is sort of
  this big lumpy pink thing on top that we call the brain the cortex um and then the
  peripheral nervous system is the other sort of side of that so the central nervous
  system is it's your cortex which is the pink wrinkly bit on top um and it's also
  lumped together with the subcortical regions which is like your cerebellum which
  is a little bumpy bit on the back um uh subcortical areas like we talk about basil
  ganglia and Thalamus and sort of those parts that are kind of like wrapped up inside
  of the big pink wrinkly bit and also your spine and things like that so these are
  the areas that we tend sort of the basic functional delineation we tend to put for
  the central nervous system is that it's the area where quote unquote processing
  occurs where information that has sort of come in through the senses is kind of
  like chunked around and sort of changed form and then often kind of turned into
  the bases of a motor Behavior a motor action um but of course that distinction like
  everything here is a cartoon version of reality it's it's a it's a pretty reasonable
  cleave point to split things apart into but it has all sorts of overlaps in Gray
  areas as as nature tends to do um particular in areas like the eye like in your
  retina or arguably in sort of like the weird cacophony of sensors on your skin there's
  stuff that would presumably normally be put into like the peripheral nervous system
  the sort of the sensory and motor aspects of the nervous system that really do things
  that kind of resemble what we would call computations the distinction immediate
  distinction between the central nervous system as the thing yeah so like this cartoon
  right here um where you have the central nervous system is this wonderful little
  off- Center brain like shape and then the spinal cord and then your peripheral nervous
  system is all the little you know sort of like often kind of pejoratively thought
  of as like just like the wiring so the things that bring sensory information from
  the external parts of your body into the central nervous system and the part and
  the sort of flip-flopped wires that send motor commands from the central nervous
  system out to the periphery um so this is the sort of cartoon version that that
  will you'll often see in textbooks and it's not wrong it's not incorrect it's not
  a bad way to describe things but it's sort of inherently incomplete and cartoonified
  uh sort of in the way that we often do when we try to parse nature which as we've
  discussed in many ways and many days uh in sort of classically impossible thing
  to do um and so Central first is peripheral nervous system that's T that's mostly
  what we've been talking about here and that kind of basic distinction there um but
  there are other kind of like subd distinctions that we can make into other sort
  of aspects of the sort of the all the different sort of nerve groups that we find
  in the body so generally speaking Neuroscience is sort of the science of neurons
  um and your neurons sort of sit in these sort of different functional roles in your
  body uh and I'm realizing kind of like as I was saying this that like even this
  distinction that I'm about to make is also kind of like a flip like a chopped up
  version of reality so kind of when I sat down to write these notes I was like oh
  yeah you got your central nervous system your peripheral nervous system and then
  you've got the enteric nervous system and your autonomic nervous system but I realized
  kind of like as I was showing this that those could arguably be just you could think
  of them as like four distinct things or you could consider them to be like subcategories
  of the two things that I just mentioned um or you could just say language is incomplete
  and we sort of name things as they are useful to us um so central nervous system
  peripheral nervous so broadly speaking central nervous system is like the central
  processor and the main computational aspects of your neurons peripheral nervous
  system is kind of like sensory motor components um inic nervous system which is
  a word that I learned this morning is the fancy term for your your gut um which
  is one of those areas that kind of like I remember when I started in grad school
  around 2008 was when I think people kind of started to really understand that your
  like your gut is really like its own kind of thing like it's there's lot going on
  in the way that the nerves are connected and sort of you know who decides like when
  various tubes will start doing peristalsis and which gland should secrete what into
  which area at which time um and all that kind of like not to mention like your whole
  the microbiome that's going on um and so that as the sort of complexity of that
  sort of gut nervous system has sort of been slowly becoming aware in the sort of
  like the scientific research Community it has also been kind of like percolating
  out into the the sort of the World At Large and so all the things that you're seeing
  about your your gut health and your microbiome and stuff like that it kind of it's
  sort of right on schedule it's sort of showing up like a decade or so after it started
  to sort of come up in the scientific literature um so we don't have as much to say
  about the anic nervous system but it will come back into the conversation um because
  it sort of it interacts with the autonomic nervous system um in a way that's kind
  of like interesting we talk about sort of closer to the bottom there um and then
  the last the last bit the sort of the star of the show today which is your autonomic
  nervous system um Auto sort of you know like the root of automatic um and your autonomic
  nervous system is the part of your nervous system that handles like the basics like
  the sort of the keep you alive stuff the kind of the lowlevel like what do you need
  to survive as an individual organism as well as a species type of system um I've
  talked about I think I mentioned at some point in this that the the nervous system
  um particularly in the central area so and that's so in the distinction I mentioned
  before like one there might be folks out there who would argue that the enic nervous
  system is an as is sort of a subcomponent of the peripheral nervous system um which
  who knows if they would uh be able to defend that position to relevant experts um
  but the same people who like to chop things up into subcategories would also place
  the autonomic nervous system as a subcomponent of the central nervous system um
  and see if I can brain stem and so often times and when you look at the the brain
  and the sort of the central nervous system and that kind of stuff you can kind of
  get a map of uh of how uh the sort of the the vi the phoenic history of that part
  of the nervous system uh by going from the inside out so as you sort of from the
  the the sort of the innermost part of your nervous system is typically the oldest
  part um and then as you sort of like go outward kind of like the layers of an onion
  or a flour or something like that the stuff that you see on the outside edges of
  everything tends to be the most recently developed the most you know the neocerebellum
  this pink wrinkling bit is sometimes called the neoc cellum is the new part of the
  cerebellum sorry the Neo cortex the new part of the cortex and then the same kind
  of story is true in smaller scale um although smaller scale in terms of volume but
  larger scale in terms of number of neurons um at the cerebellum level where there
  is a similar kind of distinction between the the middle parts are the oldest parts
  and as you sort of go outward you get the more phylogenically new parts and then
  the outside is the neocerebellum which is the part that thought to be associated
  with like tool use and like like the really fine motor control that we are good
  at um and so as we're talking about things like the autonomic nervous system we're
  talking really about like these inner inside Parts like the really deep down Parts
  like closer to your things like your brain stem and your medulla ablong and it kind
  of lives in this space of like if you think of your central controller as a kind
  of like it's like a fist like this is your uh like your your um your spine coming
  down and then the fist thing on top that's where most of the the really deep down
  subcortical regions tend to live and these tend to be the very very old aspects
  of your nervous system and then the cortex is sort of described it at one point
  as like it's kind of like the flower on top of the bush like if you think of like
  a rose bush there's this big there's this beautiful red part on the top and we spend
  a lot of time thinking about the beautiful red flower on top of the brose Bush but
  really when you look at the actual plant it's mostly Bush and then the flower is
  just kind of this really neat interesting aspect um but strictly speaking that bush
  without a rose would still be able to do most of the normal Bush things that it
  needs to do um minus creating more bushes I think that this my my botney tends to
  break down in this area um and so there's kind of this is also where you'll often
  hear kind of conversations around like the mamalian brain versus like your your
  reptile brain um where the pink wrinkly cortex bit is the part that tends to be
  associated with the your your mammal bits and then the deep down Parts is the stuff
  that we tend to associate with like The Reptilian Parts because those guys evolved
  you know much longer ago um but they like are the rest of our most of the rest all
  the rest that I'm aware of of our vertebrate friends um they share a lot of basic
  functionalities in terms of like having a heart having a nervous system um and having
  a centralized set of neurons that are sort of that run most of the show this is
  in sort of uh opposition to things like insects or you know seapods like octopus
  and stuff like that where they have a more distributed nervous system where you
  don't have the same kind of distinction between like this like high concentration
  of important parts in the middle and then sort of this more diffuse set of respons
  abilities in the periphery um all of our verbate friends especially our tetrapod
  sort of two arms two legs friends tend to have a similar sort of that's that's the
  sort of like the the Terminus of the vertebra of the of the of the sorry the spinal
  cord so all of our Cordata friends have a similar shape there um and yeah so the
  the autonomic service system handles what uh the sort of like the basic needs for
  survival um and it is at this point that I get to make uh a joke which all Neuroscience
  professors are required to make in undergraduate classrooms which is to say that
  the ANS handles the four FS of survival which is feeding fighting uh feeding fighting
  fleeing and procreation is the classic joke um and that is sort of the the basic
  idea of like these are the things that you need to be able to do you need to be
  able to eat food you need to be able to fight when you have to run away when you
  have to and then do the complex behaviors that sort of proliferate the species and
  the autonomic nervous system is sort of the part that tends to is thought to handle
  a lot of that um and as we are chopping things up into increasingly small boxes
  uh your autonomic nervous system is also in a cartoonified version of the world
  consisting considered to uh involve two main aspects which we tend to refer to um
  actually I found even though I do I do a lot of this where I like I looking up images
  I just like searched Google images for like the topic in question um which always
  feels a little bit lazy but also kind of like it's I like sort of showing the the
  process a bit and it's I find it especially helpful in this case because you get
  to see just different types of cartoons and the diff and this is going to become
  relevant in the with the next search like most of these are pretty okay um but you
  get to see kind of like the different ways that we tend to talk about these things
  and different sort of pictures we tend to use to describe these things and some
  of them have greater or lesser detail and some of them have more or less resemblance
  to sort of like the actual thing that you might see if you were to take that organism
  and chop it and take pictures of it whereas others are far more cartoonified um
  but I think it's really important to notice that all of these are cartoons none
  of these are accurate and none of these represent what you would see if you chopped
  up any actual human and certainly don't represent what you would see if you chopped
  up all possible humans which I don't recommend doing either of those things um but
  it's sort of like I think we we tend to have we very naturally I think tend towards
  this fiction that they're sort of that these pictures somehow represent reality
  um and really they represent the best approximation we have for sort of carving
  up reality into conceptual boxes that are simple enough for us to be able to wrap
  our heads around and in the same way that you know this like this cartoon of the
  brain has less details than this cartoon of the brain um but they're both cartoons
  and they both sort of have these like false separations of this thing this part
  is that color this part is that color we call this part the parietal lobe and this
  part the occipital lobe and we don't draw these colors in random places for no reason
  but we also sort of must always remember that like we put these words into nature
  we didn't crack open the brain and see a stamp that said this is the parietal lobe
  we just discovered that if we call this thing the certain thing then we can say
  stuff about the whole region which tends to be more true than it would be if we
  talked about a different part of the brain so the occipital lobe is where the visual
  cortex lives and so if we talk about Vision we're mostly talking about here but
  that doesn't that you're not going to find visy stuff in other parts of the nervous
  system you absolutely will so that's yeah yeah and as there's going to be a particular
  search that is going to show a very Stark distinction between like scientifi stuff
  and the kind of like woow woo stuff like a lot of we're going to be getting towards
  really touches on woo like the sort of like getting into the kind of like from the
  edge of like what you might call like proper science which I wouldn't recommend
  down to like popular conceptions of Science and down to like what we might call
  pseudo science which is sort of not doesn't track re doesn't track scientific understanding
  in the same way that we would hope things like um you know more popular science
  approximations do where Popular Science is like is like this kind of stuff like
  it's you know I would even argue that things like undergraduate textbooks on Neuroscience
  are on the edge of Popular Science because they are the versions of the story that
  we tell to people who don't have a lot of background in the region and don't and
  wouldn't benefit from sort of seeing the way that it tends to be worked on in professional
  level where it's just much more murky and messy and sort of less coherent so we
  tend to start with different layers of cartoon ification and then we sort of try
  to slowly back you into the the reality of the world Which is far more chaotic and
  mixed up uh yeah so autonomic nervous system um is the the two sort of main aspects
  and branches of that are what we tend to refer to as the sympathetic and the parasympathetic
  nervous systems um and those again cartoonified distinction um tends to be stuff
  that we associate with the um you know on the one side you have your fight ORF flight
  aspects sort of the the cranked up um high speed high you know the you know getting
  into a fight type of uh aspects of inhabiting a body which must survive in a world
  where where in predation has evolved um and then the parasympathetic nervous system
  which is what we tend to refer to as the rest and relax aspects of our nervous system
  and that's the part of you know sleeping digesting food you know feeling calm those
  kind of things um and the way as I was sort of looking into the the the deeper sort
  of deeper aspects of this um area you know doing things like reading you know like
  scanning review articles like reading the Wikipedia page which I've always recommend
  for any new domain um and just kind of like checking the things that I think I know
  and seeing if if I can find some connection to more established uh research um there
  is as often as the case um a lot of Shifting around in the way that we tend to think
  about the autonomic nervous system and the sympathetic parasympathetic divide and
  who has what role and how should we think about them and is it like and so when
  I talk about this um I'm going to be trying to sort of do an appropriate mixing
  of like yeah I try I'll try to appropriately Elevate the the things that I would
  mostly say about it which tends to be the older stuff with what I'm picking up appears
  to be kind of like most of the shift towards a new new ways of thinking and in general
  anytime I talk about something that seems simple that's the stuff that is just it's
  never that simple so anytime I say somethingone like here's the autonomic nervous
  system nervous system there's two parts this one and that one and that one does
  this and this one does that all of those kind of like hard delineations and hard
  labelings and and sort of you know simplified division of labor that's the stuff
  where if you actually poked at it and dug into it the answer is always going to
  be that that's it's more complicated than that and there's and that those are just
  you know those are the the cartoon stories that we tell because it's a combination
  of what we used to think which we tend to used to think that things were simpler
  than we have found out found them out to be um and also that that is the distinction
  that we tend to start with when we're explaining things to people because it's not
  always um it's not the most functional thing to just start every conversation with
  it's too complex to understand in 15 lifetimes so uh we tend to start with with
  the cartoons um so yeah so the sympathetic parasympathetic nervous system fight
  ORF flight rest or relax we'll we'll stick with that rough delineation for now um
  very hard to remember these things this is one of the many areas of science ESP
  Neuroscience where some asshol a couple hundred years ago decided to name the two
  things words that sound almost exactly the same um like afferent and ephant for
  the sensory versus motor nerves which I still don't know which one is which I think
  afferent is happens after the event so it's a sensory and then ephant is affects
  the world was the motor but who I'll bet whoever they thought they were so clever
  when they came up with that and and I have I'll hate them forever um so we tend
  to rely on uh pneumonics for that and so my particular pneumonic for the sympathetic
  and parasympathetic nervous systems is that the sympathetic is the fight ORF flight
  one because you're just beat the guy up and now you're sympathetic for them uh versus
  the parasympathetic because you're like eating a pair and you're relaxing and eating
  a pair it's not a good pneumonic but it's the best one I've got um I realized as
  I was doing this that like the the would probably be spectacular at pneumonics so
  as some percentage of you go off to medical school and are forced to memorize things
  which I am I personally am allowed to skim through um that might be a pretty good
  use of that technology um so yeah so we have so sympathetic parasympathetic sympathetic
  is the figh or flight and the one of the distinctions that I that I came across
  when I was looking into this uh was that one of the ways that we have started to
  add some complexity to that basic fight ORF flight versus rest and relax is that
  the perhaps a better way to think of it is that your sympathetic nervous system
  is the part that is tuned for high-speed fastpaced sort of low latency actions um
  that require like arousal and typically the activation of like your muscular skeletal
  system um in order to react to the world at a very short time scale whereas the
  parasympathetic nervous system is the part that handles the slower calmer quieter
  processes that sort of play out over long periods of time um things like digestion
  and um and sleeping and stuff like that versus like getting into a fight or something
  like that um and then of course there are many aspects of our behavior that require
  some combination of both um so like think about like playing sports or something
  like that where good performance requires this combination of really fast and precise
  action um with a calmness that is that is that allows you to sort of avoid going
  into kind of like panicky State um and there are all various other uh socio personal
  physical physiological processes that similarly require a complex balance of arousal
  and relaxation um so yeah and so you so when you look up these autonomic nervous
  system you see a lot of pictures like this where you say parasympathetic does this
  sympathetic system does that uh parasympathetic system attaches to these parts of
  your your body and your parasympathetic attaches to these parts um and in you know
  of course in many ways it's like these are reasonable things to say I also believe
  like the auto onomic nervous system in the Wiki page we'll talk about the pictures
  in a second here um but there's like you know some nice tables a lot of physiology
  stuff which never in my area of research like I tend to be able to avoid in learning
  too much specifics about this type of thing but they you know these letters and
  numbers are uh vertebrae and sort of when they where they tend you know T6 t7 T8
  that's their Thor the sixth and seventh and eth vertebrae of your thoracic region
  versus you have your cervical and your thoracic and your Lumbar and blah blah blah
  um then down here in the function you get these nice sort of lists here um typically
  the um aspects of your sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems they tend
  to be paired with one another um and so the you know the parasympathetic connection
  to your your gut uh starts to digestion and starts peristalsis and secretion of
  you know various gops into various places um in your sympathetic Ser server system
  tends to shut that down um gives a sense that like if you're going to get into a
  fight you don't want to be wasting a bun of energy like digesting stuff um and similarly
  yeah sort of as you sort of look at these a lot of these things you can think of
  as distin distinction between the stuff that you have to do to generally survive
  um being turned on by your parasympathetic nervous system and the things that are
  sort of like that you know the the optional subsystems uh that you would want to
  turn off if you were in like a you know a fight ORF flight sort of environment um
  being um activated by the sympathetic nervous system or yeah you're yeah you don't
  digest things when you're in a fight it's sort of we're not operating at that time
  scale right now we'll digest this later is the basic thought um and there are some
  interesting connections which we will get back to if I manage my time properly um
  around things like your eyes and your iris and your sort of like you know pupil
  construction and things like that um and I discovered this fun interesting thing
  that like uh parasympathetic affects your the lens inside of your eye that part
  that you can sort of like like if you look at something and like fuzz out like make
  the world defocus you're you're controlling the lens inside of your eye and those
  muscles are assoc are sort of interact with that sympathetic parasympathetic divide
  in an interesting way um so back to the cartoons uh there are some particular anatomical
  aspects of your nervous system um that sort of tend to be associated with these
  different with the Sy sythetic and Paris sympathetic parts of your body um and this
  would be the place where if you were on the side of saying that your the ANS is
  not a part of your central nervous system you would point to these anatomical features
  to say see look this thing lives outside of the spine so it's part of the peripheral
  vers or or it's I wouldn't want to say it's part of the peripheral but it's definitely
  not part of the central because it's not it's outside of your spine but it's very
  close to that so it's hard to say quite what uh yeah so so the argument continues
  um and in particular your sympathetic nervous system is related to an interesting
  aspect called the sympathetic trunk which are pairs of they're pairs of ganglia
  that live sort of like that run down the edge of your spine on the outside so ganglia
  is just a cluster of neurons um we talk about the um retinal ganglion cells that
  sort of pool together um different photo receptors a lot of things like you know
  insects and sort of creatures that don't have a central nervous system they do tend
  to have ganglia so with things like you know dragonfly they have a gangli and bulbs
  that handle the the visual inputs and motor outputs um there which you know then
  when you start asking the question of well is the what's the difference between
  a ganglion and like a central nervous system it's like well that's where we're getting
  into Linguistics so it's not really defined um but let me find so sympathetic trunk
  um so yeah so they and so these little bulul of neuro of neurons that sort of run
  down your spine um that's the sort of the the home of where your uh sympathetic
  nervous system tends to interact with your body and it let's see it sort of like
  it runs like from the so this is that sort of Knob thing on the top um this is down
  into your so this is L5 which is like right around here and then you s this is the
  it's called the CIS aquinus at the bottom here because it looks like a horse tail
  um and so all down the spine you have these sort of paired sets of gangan bulbs
  um which is the puff that we tend to associate with the sympathetic nervous system
  and these bulbs get activated um and sort of they start that that tradeoff from
  oh I think we might be in a fight oh I think we need to sort of ramp up the general
  activation of the nervous system and these parts this is these gangling cells handle
  that kind of like the that cranking up of arousal um and I think about this a lot
  uh so in the same way that we have to be careful about thinking about um these cartoonified
  versions of the nervous system and the body and biology in general um you also have
  to be careful doing the thing that I'm about to do which is starting to like use
  your own personal experience of being inside of one of these weird Meat Puppets
  um to make sense of some of the stuff that you see in terms of the anatomy um you
  have to be careful about it but you don't have to be that careful about it um because
  if you think about what the nervous system what the sympathetic nervous system does
  is it tends to be a part of like being startled being scared be like oh my God there's
  something over there one of my favorite uh nervous system responses which is the
  startle reflex uh which is a part of our ner nervous system that we share with house
  flies um which is like large blooming object and you kind of have that that jump
  thing and there's there's for me there's this strong association between those types
  of startle responses and like a light like lightning going down your spine there's
  kind of like a like a shocking moment um and I was very sort of fascinated to discover
  when I was learning about this stuff sort of um I would say a little bit embarrassingly
  late um as in my career as a neuroscientist partially because of I started as a
  philosophy major so I missed a lot of the standard undergraduate introduction stuff
  um and sort of just realizing that like cuz what these things are doing is they're
  doing things like telling your body to dump adrenaline they're they're cranking
  up your your muscles and increasing the sensitivities and you know like lowering
  pain sensitivities and increasing like sort of like low like lowlevel Activation
  so you can respond quicker to stimuli that kind of like like Wolverine kind of like
  response comes from these things sort of getting cranked on um and that cranking
  on of course that AR describing like a very high level of crank but sort of the
  the sematic experience of having this kind of like lightning running down your spine
  associated with those sort of startle responses and then like academically learning
  that that startle response is associated with a set of paired gangan cells that
  run down your spine it's one of those things it's like is that the same thing or
  am I just telling stories to myself is there a difference between those things and
  the cartoons we see here um who knows um but yeah so from an anatomical perspective
  uh the sympathetic nervous system is associated with these paired spinal ganglion
  cells in the sympathetic trunk um any other and if you're wondering what this strange
  picture here is the same it's kind of it's like there's almost like a subway map
  aspect to these cartoons where it's like you know it doesn't tell you exactly the
  layout but like you're going to you're going to hit this if you're trying to get
  from this one to this one you should go in that direction and you know you're going
  to hit a thing I think these shapes are associated with like you know um activation
  versus uh inhibition and stuff like that and you know this part connects to that
  part and actually no sorry these ones up here are more peripheral but um but yeah
  and so speaking of these blue lines so the red lines here are the sort of the sympathetic
  and then the blue lines here correspond to the parasympathetic and this is the place
  where I have to put a Big Woo disclaimer because um we're now going to start talking
  about such a thing as the vagus nerve which is a real thing that exists it is uh
  a real anatomical feature um but and you're going to and it's it's used in a lot
  of sort of as we're we're now going to start getting into the space of like how
  do you like how do you calm your nervous system how do you like relate to the world
  and in that region a lot of people you know goodmed good-hearted people doing their
  best can often find their ways into ways of of explaining the world that sort of
  blur the line between this is like useful things to tell humans and this is like
  empirical things that we believe is true about the physical world um and I'll give
  you a couple hints about how you can like tell which part of the landscape you're
  in um as you do things like search for the vagal nerve so vagal nerve uh is a really
  neat really neat guy and it is um it's the longest nerve in your body by a very
  by a very uh high factor vagel is like the same roote as like vagrant or like whatever
  else like it means wandering it's like I was going to say Voyage but I don't think
  that's actually the same thing but uh it means wandering maybe the same I don't
  know so the nerve is is called the wondering nerve and it kind of see so this is
  a place where like I have to really pick my pictures carefully because a lot of
  these are cartoons that I wouldn't want to be wouldn't want to put behind like I
  don't know what this guy this they're missing some really important parts here um
  this is a nice picture I think so the Vegas nerve starts um so the sympathetic trunk
  sort of runs down the spine and sort of has these aspects that sort of go into the
  spine at the various vertebrae the vagel Nerf starts it sort of like squirts out
  of your um like your brain stem at the uh where 153 uh I've never cared but somehow
  I'm guessing B go cranial nerve X structure I don't know one of the cranial nerves
  yeah it's one of the cranial nerves so at for you Future Doctor types you will be
  forced to look at many this list of cranial nerves will become very familiar to
  you um cranial nerves optic nerve is one of them the ocul motor nerves that controls
  eye movements is one of them um it's basically just the fa the nerves that control
  your facial expressions are among some of these um and then the vagal nerve is one
  of them so it it it breaks out of your central nervous system in in the cranium
  and then sort of runs down through your body and like wraps around that's not helpful
  open image um so this is all one neuron and it has many so the with neurons like
  the long parts are called the axons then you have um I'm actually I was going to
  say dendrites but I'm not sure if they dendrites are at the beginning or the end
  but it's kind of this is all one long neuron and it tends to go down and it wraps
  around a lot of the the viscera of your body like all the the goopy bits in the
  middle including your your respiratory system um and down into this sort of gut
  part of your body and so like when I earlier when I talked about the anic nervous
  system the sort of the gut based nervous system um it does this is its main mode
  of communication this is the main mode of communication between your your guts and
  the central nervous system is through this interaction through of the the V nerve
  and um and then similar so and so similarly to um come back to this a little bit
  more in a second here but I kind of think similar to the way that the that um the
  sympathetic trunk I tend to associate with that like shocking feeling of being surprised
  um you can think about all the different like emotions and feelings that you have
  that sort of relate to like sinking feelings in your chest or like your guts feeling
  all tied up or you know like empty things in the pit of your stomach right here
  and I had a similar sort of like reaction when I first saw pictures of this and
  I was like oh yeah that's where all of those if I were to point to those feelings
  it's like yeah this these in these sort of spaghetti cacophonies of parts of the
  Vegas nerve um and yeah so where we at with the yeah so those are so those are kind
  of like obviously there's many many more details um but the yeah so oh sorry I so
  I guess there's some parts that come out the bottom too I don't know um but yeah
  so your Vegas nerve has these kind of like whereas the sympathetic system has it
  sort of like runs down the spine your parasympathetic tends to be associated with
  these sort of like long range connections through the vagus nerve which sort of
  are not as connected to the kind of like the muscular skeletal aspects of your body
  um and so before when I was we were looking at that sort of list of different functions
  and um you know which part is like what the effect of parasympathetic activation
  is on these given processes and given organs versus sympathetic that trade-off is
  thought to be mediated through um sort of uh what's the word uh ah there's a fancy
  word for this but it's like the tradeoff type of activation where uh one of these
  system tends to crank up while the other tends to crank down um you get the same
  kind of effect when we I think I talked about this more in some some of the subgroups
  but in the like the ways that are reflexes trade off when we're doing things like
  walking where I my as I'm walking my feet are going are sort of cycling through
  stance and swing um with a very tight spatio temporal coupling um where as my foot
  hits the ground my leg muscles have to be stiff enough and strong enough to support
  the weight of my body but then the second my foot leaves the ground they get all
  floppy so they can swing through um without having to like burn a bunch of energy
  and the um the transition from that stance to swing at the level of your limbs during
  things like Locomotion is um is of is mediated from your upper levels of your nervous
  system um through like the top upper part of the motor hierarchy uh often through
  the um Shifting the gain of different sort of lowlevel reflexes so like the stretch
  reflex that tends to sort of resist motion um that transition from stance to swing
  at from each step is sort of mediated at some level by your higher you know I think
  at that point it's like your cerebellum in that part of region um uh shifting how
  the the gain on that lowlevel stretch reflex is where a lot of that um The Stance
  to swing transitions tend to happen and there's a similar kind of like uh reciprocal
  activation that's the TR I was looking forward to there's a reciprocal activation
  component of like the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems here um and
  so yeah and so like I said I could we could teach several classes on the specific
  Anatomy associated with these systems but in terms of like high level broadcut cartoonified
  versions of the story um the the main anatomical aspects of the sympathetic and
  parasympathetic nervous systems are associated with the sympathetic trunk and those
  sort of paired gangan cells in the sympathetic case and then that vagus nerve sort
  of wandering through your body in the parasympathetic sense um and so yeah so moving
  into sort more functional space uh the main so the idea there is to sort of like
  this transition of your nervous system into states of sort of you know figh ORF
  flight high pressure low Time Low Time scale um leave it all on the field types
  of of activation of your of your sympathetic nervous system versus the lower this
  longer time scale slower relax of restorative aspects in uh as your parasympathetic
  system takes over and we're going to talk a little most of the rest of the class
  is going to be talking about that transition and your ability to appropriately um
  mediate between the different states that your your body should be in given the
  state of the world that you're in um in specific speically I want to start talking
  about this in terms of a of a measurable aspect so a lot of the research the behavioral
  Research into these areas of the nervous system autonomic nervous system looks at
  things at that are that are typically handled by those uh by your ANS um the main
  one being um things like your breathing and your heart rate um and specifically
  your heart rate because uh your breathing is obviously an important aspect of survival
  um it is also available for voluntary control like you most of the time that you're
  breathing your breathing is happening on its own but you can choose to hold your
  breath you can choose to inhale you can choose to Exhale and you can sort of enact
  that volitional control um to some extent like you cannot hold your breath until
  you die but you can hold your breath for a good long time and I I don't know if
  you could pass out by holding your breath but don't try it um and whereas your heart
  is sort of less it's it's it's like one layer deeper like you you cannot control
  your heart rate in the same way that you control your breath and you can't control
  your breath in the same way that you can control your hand um so your heart rate
  is sort of at is like one layer deeper in your nervous system where you no longer
  have that kind of Direct volutional Control and so looking at that as a measurement
  um becomes a really interesting and valuable sort of window into the the status
  and the functionality that's going on at that at that layer of your nervous system
  control um and there's this and one of the main sort of Concepts that comes out
  is the uh this notion of heart rate variability so there is a certain kind of like
  naive mechanistic sort of like robot brained thinking about the heart where uh which
  I believe for quite some time um which was that if you you would imagine that if
  you're a doctor assessing the health of someone's nervous system you would look
  at their heart rate and you would look for heart rate variability and you would
  say heart rate variability is good when it's low we like it when our heart beats
  on a very regular basis and sort of like like a metronome and the variability of
  timing between beats is low that's when your heart is doing its job very well um
  but it turns out that although this is you know caveat caveat around this um that
  actually tends not to be the case and when we think about things like heart rate
  variability one of the things that people that we look for as if I was a medical
  type of doctor is um is there's a there's a healthy range of variability that if
  you are not showing then that's a s that's a a sign that there's something going
  a skew under the hood um and so briefly just like if you think about heart rate
  variability uh like it's literally just like measuring the heart rate and then doing
  statistics on the time between beats um this is not sort of let's see heart rate
  variability um if you if anyone's ever seen like an EKG EKG which stands for echo
  cardiogram which starts with a C don't ask me why um it's the timing between these
  beats that we're sort of thinking of as the heartbeat and if anyone starts the there's
  a lot of other things you can say about the other types of shapes that are going
  on here which is literally below my level of analysis um but it's the variability
  between the the actual like LS and dubs of your heart um that we associate with
  heart rate variability um yeah there we go and so when we and we think about those
  numbers like there's a there's a inherent time scale there because we're talking
  about like the statistics of like a a timed thing and you can imagine that if you
  looked so at some point in all of our Lives we will be asked by our doctors to wear
  a heart rate monitor for like 48 hours straight and they will measure our heartbeat
  and they'll look at things about the statistics of those heart rates to sort of
  establish to look at various aspects of our nervous system and you can imagine that
  at like the 24-hour time scale you're going to see an effects of the fact that you
  tend to sleep at night versus you tend to like walk around in the daytime so there's
  going to be a variability at that 24-hour scale where it tends to be faster for
  part of the day and then slower for another part of the day um but that's not the
  time and that's an interesting time scale but that's not the time scale that we're
  thinking about here um the time skill that we tend to associate with this conversation
  around the autonomic nervous system and these sort of trade-offs between the sympathetic
  and parasympathetic nervous systems happen on the scale of breaths um because one
  of the sort of sort of subtle aspects of the sympathetic parasympathetic nervous
  system is that they in a healthy happy sort of cheerfully functioning nervous system
  um the trade-off between the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems happen every
  time you take a breath and specifically I always forget which one which um when
  you inhale your sympathetic system starts to wake up and your heart rate increases
  in the inhale part of your breath and then when you exhale your parasympathetic
  takes over and your heart rate slows down at that part of your breath um it's very
  hard to feel that um and again it's that's at that layer when I try to sort of queue
  into my heart rate and tell if it's speeding up when I'm inhaling and slowing down
  when I'm exhaling it's it's right at that layer where my ability to be aware of
  it is around the same I think uh skill like the same power level as my ability to
  like lie to myself about my Sensations so I really have no idea if I'm actually
  feeling that if I'm just like expecting it so I am but I think that whatever that
  sort of personal sematic Journey might be um it's easier to do when my heart rate
  is elevated so if I'm exercising if my heart rate is beating fast in general I can
  often kind of like feel like when I inhale especially if I hold my breath you can
  feel your heart rate kind of speeding up and then when you exhale you kind of feel
  it kind of slowing down um and so that conversation on heart rate variability is
  something that happens um ideally at the scale of your breath and so when they're
  looking for things and typically when you hear people talk about things like heart
  rate variability they're they tend to be talking about it on that time scale and
  they're not talking about it on things like the 24-hour time scale or even like
  the multi hour time scale although if you dig into this even a little bit there's
  plenty that people have to say about heart rate variabil heart rate variability
  at those kinds of time scales um and so this is where we get to this sort of uh
  little bit of jargon which in my previous explorations of this area is this piece
  of jargon is is as far as I can tell the boundary layer between what I think of
  as like legitimate quote unquote legitimate science on this topic versus the woowoo
  science on this topic um is the boundary between neurovisceral integration and poly
  vagel Theory um so poly vagel theory if you see things talking about poly vagel
  you're probably in wo toown and that doesn't mean that it's not useful in any sort
  of on a personal level but typic I think that the term poly Bagel is when they start
  talking about like oh there's like a ventral path and a dorsal path and the vental
  does this and the dorsal does that and as far as I can tell there is no actual scientific
  uh backing for that anatomical distinction between like different parts of the Vegas
  nerve handling different parts of your regulatory system or whatever so if you see
  the term poly vagal or dorsal ventral or something like that not to say it's not
  useful but just know that you're you're you're off the standard scientific story
  when you get to that space neurovisceral integration model a neurovisceral theory
  um is the step back from that which just says that what we might consider to be
  like a healthy happy nicely functioning uh relationship between a given let's say
  mamalian nervous system in the World At Large can be measured and thought of as
  the ability of your nervous system to do a happy healthy and comfortable tradeoff
  between those different aspects of your autonomic nervous system in a sort of smooth
  and careful and sort of like regular manner so the ability of your body to transition
  from that sort of like arousal state that we associate with sympathetic and fight
  ORF flight and stuff like that and transitioning into the rest and relax and digest
  and those parts of things the ability to make those transitions smooth smoothly
  from one to the other um is what we tend to call neurovisceral Theory or even at
  a broader cut than that it's just this kind of this idea that your the neuron part
  like the like the the your your nervous system your neurons your central nervous
  system your brain your whatever um has a connection to your viscera like the the
  the the Lesser organs um and specifically your heart rate and your gut and your
  lungs and that those things are connected to each other and if you don't believe
  that um just know like you can think about something scary and your heart rate will
  go up so there is a connection between like the the most high futin abstrac inist
  parts of your cognitive neural system and the lowest level like we got to pump the
  goop through the body so that we can continue to like walk around and you know not
  die um and so those parts are connected and so thinking about so what I think of
  as neurovisceral and the way we've talked about the Linguistics of these stuff if
  you see two words which are squished together you can replace the o with a slash
  and that's kind of where you're at so neurovisceral is sort of neural visceral where
  again viscera is like the goopy the Lesser organs if you think about this in the
  way that don't think about the world like that but you can imagine what why one
  might um and so yeah and so with that I'm going to accelerate a little bit away
  from the sort of the the gooper parts of Neuroscience and into the more like socio
  behavioral Parts um and speaking specifically about like this is where the trauma
  talk comes in um which I will try to do in a yeah we'll try to we'll try to sort
  of thread various lines there um so one of the main I would say again roughly on
  that time scale of like my entry into neuroscience and then sort of like it's becoming
  much more prevalent these days uh one of the ways that we have started to really
  think about um the nervous system and the role of your central nervous system and
  like why do you have a brain why do you have a a a a cordate um spinal cord like
  what's the what do those what's what role do those play in your actual ability to
  be a successful animal in the world um there is more and more of a belief that mostly
  what your nervous system is doing is predicting the future that's mostly what your
  cognitive and neural and central nervous systems are are for um your job as a as
  a organism as a creature as a human as a sort of cognitive agent is to predict the
  future on the basis on the basis of noisy out-of-date information about the current
  state of the world um combined with your memories and your histories and sort of
  like the lessons learned from previous um ask previous interactions and that's true
  on pretty much all time scales so with the sort of the classic like throwing a ball
  and catching it um when I you know I have the like so my senses are the slow are
  the fastest way that I get information from the world and arguably the only way
  that I get information from the world but even when I have a sensory experience
  it's always something that happened after CU afterwards weever learned SL remembered
  that um so your sensory information happens after the event in question occurred
  and then so using that information um which is noisy abstract out ofd I can sort
  of make some predictions based off my previous experience my sort of very wide and
  long array of previous experiences interacting with the world and I can say okay
  with the sensations that I felt on my hand coupled with the flashes of light I'm
  getting from my eyes um if I believe that if I send these series of motor commands
  to this arm it will hit the the world will occur in the way that I expected it to
  and the ball will land in my hand and you can see like when you if you ever look
  at like babies trying to get around and try to like interact with their world you
  could they're kind of like especially when they're very young they're kind of firing
  at random and they they sort of they they have this kind of like tripping aspect
  of their behavior and then we actually get something that is kind of just like holy  it
  worked and so the way that our nervous system works especially at that sort of Developmental
  layer is when we make a prediction where that works out like we expected it to like
  we wanted it to there is a um a reinforcement that occurs um we're want to talk
  about the goop again it's thought to be associated with like the dopaminergic system
  so if I oh I'm pretty sure if I if I do this with my body I'll get the outcome that
  I want and then the outcome that I want there's a dopaminergic release and your
  your literal dopaminergic is like the generation of dopamine so it like you squirt
  all these like chemicals into your nervous into the soup that basically had the
  effect of reinforcing whatever just happened was good let's reinforce that those
  like those neurons should should be connected in that way because it leads to results
  that I like in my life um and this gets into this concept that I'm going to describe
  here which is veence so veilance is just again root of value it's kind of like it's
  a thumbs up or a thumbs down um so good vean things are things that are generally
  good bad veilance things are things that are generally bad like if I reached out
  to this and it had like you know razor blades in it and I got cut I don't like that
  that's bad similarly if I fire 15 milliseconds too late and I miss the thing and
  I drop it um that's a negative valence and specifically it's useful to think about
  that because notice I'm not talking anything there about scale um like .1 is negative
  in the same way that 150,000 is negative and similarly 0.1 is positive negative
  a th000 is negative the veilance there is not a measure of the scale um and there's
  this so there's this relationship between when we make a prediction about the world
  and whether or not the prediction sort of works out in the way that we wanted it
  to as to what what the veilance of the of that outcome is defines whether our nerous
  system is like that was great let's do more of that let's you know dump some dopamine
  and reinforce those connections versus that was bad I didn't like that whatever
  just happened there was we made some bad predictions which means we made some mistakes
  there were some errors occurred in the calculation we need to correct for those
  things at some level um so yeah so there the out so there's this Central concept
  of prediction and then this other concept of like the outcome of those predictions
  defining sort of nervous system will try to organize itself um yeah and then know
  why I put that out of order but let's do that who cares um how we doing all time
  doing okay on time uh what I going to say yeah and I think I forgot to put this
  in so I'm not really sure what the what the order of operation should be here but
  um one of the things I've really noticed very recently um is that so that concept
  of your nervous system mostly being about prediction has been in the perceptual
  motor literature for quite some time like it was sort of it was already a little
  bit old hat by the time I started grad school and I have started seeing that same
  kind of thinking coming into the way that we tend to think of emotions and the way
  that our sort of the the that aspect of our nervous system and we tend I think naively
  or sort of like the general naive uh uh um relationship that we think of as emotions
  we think of them as if they were Sensations and as if they were reactions to the
  world and reactions to the way that the world is presenting itself to us and I think
  there's a very and there's obviously some aspect where that's going to be the case
  like a a alligator coming out of the water that's scary I am feeling fear um but
  there's also a predictive aspect of that emotion like I feel fear from that thing
  because I think that it will hurt me um I feel happy when I see cake cuz I think
  I'm going to eat cake um and so there's this interesting aspect of thinking of our
  our emotional responses to the world as being less about immediate reactions to
  the state of the world and more about a sort of a vague prediction about what this
  available information is going to mean down the line at some time scale possibly
  quick possibly slow and what I should do as a result of that with the alligator
  coming at me it's like I have to do alligator stuff very quickly uh whereas with
  the cake showing up it's like I have I need to do cake things at my own rate um
  and so you can kind of see how there's that like and typically speaking too like
  when we think about things like the emotional parts of our brain where emotions
  come from we're talking about things like amydala and those sort of like like subcortical
  regions which tend to live closer to the brain stem than they do to the cortex and
  often times emotions occur at the neurophysiological level in the form of like chemical
  dumps like there's a there's there some chemical gets released into the soup that
  we tend to associate with this that or the other emotion and a lot of like um anti-depressants
  and you know other forms of pharmaceuticals um operate by either stimulating the
  dump of that like you you just consume that chemical and so there's more of it floating
  around so your emotions are avoid or handled that way um or yeah you either eat
  synthetic forms or you sort of ask your body to dump those chemicals into your brain
  so like MDMA happens because by telling your brain dump all your happy juices um
  and so people tend to feel happy and then they also tend to feel like sad after
  the fact because of because you you you dumped all your happy juices and you have
  to wait to sort of get more um and and yeah and so and so this is where we sort
  of started getting into the the trauma Talk of the day um because if you think about
  this sort of the combination of all of these things and the um the sort of the the
  ANS and the sort of the trade-off of those different parts of your autonomic nervous
  system uh with the this aspect of prediction and the and the the aspect of your
  your nervous system's main job being to predict the state of the future um this
  is where you get into the places where uh traumatic events basically places where
  something things happen that you did not like can lead to these sort of like asynchronies
  between your your ANS and sort of breakdowns of what we sort of call that neurovisual
  integration theory of like happy and healthy whatever depends on your an's ability
  to appropriate hot swap between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems
  um which you could sort of think of as like the ability to like relax when it's
  time to relax um because typically we don't have a problem with the other part um
  and see where they trying to go this yeah and also just before we get into here
  just because we're getting into psychology spaces um we're going to talk so PTSD
  is the letters we tend to associate with this post-traumatic stress disorder post
  is after a traumatic event leads to a stress a stress disorder and I specifically
  want to talk about the term disorder um in in the context of the concept of veilance
  um a disorder is cause is anytime things are in the way of your ability to live
  the life that you want to live and also in the kind of the wooi the the sort of
  you you'll see a lot of conversations in this topic which are more or less informed
  by like empirical research um and you also hear a lot in just like the general ways
  that we have started to talk about these things and are sort of casual environments
  and you sometimes hear people try to make a distinction between like capital T trauma
  with lowercase T trauma um where like lowercase tea is like I like I tried to drink
  the coffee and it was too hot and I burned my little lip whereas Capital tea is
  like I got into a car accident and now I'm afraid of cars um and and I think I you
  see people sort of I think reasonably like upset that some people might feel like
  they're like watering down these like important concepts by associating the same
  kind of conversation um to like the day-to-day like sometimes things don't work
  out like sorry them de beats versus like things like PTSD which can be very debilitating
  for people's lives um and I think that that's valid in some way um but also like
  like we've talked about nature is sort of goopy gradients and sort of Shades of
  Gray and where we choose to draw the line between what is just normal re relations
  to the world like sorry kid thems the braks get tough that's the world and that's
  like the healthy parts of stress that help you interact with the world you know
  in you know in in a in a productive and a way that's effective for yourself I think
  it's I'm less interested in trying to figure out exactly where to draw that line
  and more interested in help in trying toig make sure that people know how to draw
  that line in ways that are appropriate for themselves so I think that's why I want
  to think about the terms disorder as less of a thing that you're going to find in
  the DSM 5 saying or six maybe now like this is when it's disorder this is when it's
  just daily life and more in the terms of like it's a it's a thing that you kind
  of get to choose like is this something that is getting in the way of my ability
  to learn the life my live my life as I want to or is this just like you know learning
  important life lessons and having this the the acrel of experiences that we have
  eventually call things like wisdom and experience so up to you um and specifically
  I think that when we think of disorder it's it's often sort of like somehow the
  gears of the machine have slipped in some way and then the things that would normally
  operate as they would want to have there there's a thing something is stuck and
  so the the machine cannot operate in the way that it would normally operate um and
  that's what we think of you know names of disorders such as PTSD um where and I'm
  also going to make a distinction here between uh PTSD which is what we tend to think
  of as like you know something really bad happened and now I'm having a hard time
  interacting with the world so think like it it typically is like one really bad
  thing happened um think like a car accident um so like bad event and now have you
  had a very scary experience where you became you know you had a you know came close
  to you know Serious injury or maybe had a serious injury and now it's affecting
  your ability to interact with the world um I would call that acute trauma like one
  one big bad thing not cute acute um and this is in distinct distinction between
  a more I think subtle newer sort of way of thinking about PTSD which is we tend
  to call complex PTSD um which is the different type of behavior that we tend to
  associate with living in a world that is a general long-term explosure to a generally
  unsafe environment um so less one big car accident and more like you know living
  in sort of a you know maybe like lowgrade child abuse or like living in like food
  insecure environments where you grow up as a as a child and you can't always get
  food when you're hungry there's no one big thing that's bad enough to to like warrant
  like oh yeah and this was the event that I'm having to deal with it's more like
  living longterm with like a low grade harm that sort of pervades everything um I
  don't know if you can perhaps think of any people or groups of people who might
  experience the world that is generally speaking in a lowgrade way unsafe and filled
  with like small sub threshold traumas that sort of never quite cross the barrier
  of something you might be able to label specifically um but nonetheless become integrated
  into the way that you view the world um I can't think of any but maybe you can um
  and yeah and so just a real quick shout out to like some popside books that I have
  that sort of like the I would say the start of my own exploration of this this uh
  into the space the classic one is a book called the body keeps the score by James
  Vander Coke um which it doesn't really make that distinction between a and complex
  but it is about tends to be about acute uh acute PTSD written by James Gander Coke
  who was one of the people who wrote the uh the DSM definition of PTSD and got it
  sort of put into the common vernacular it gets a lot of flak these days I think
  for good reason because it's like I think the main complaint is like it is not written
  in a trauma-informed way it is it talks about like people's bad experience and like
  it's you know it's like it's hard to recommend it to people who've experienced bad
  effects because it's like it it has like sort of like let's talk about these let's
  talk about the things that people may have literally come to the book to be able
  to process in like a very graphic way so that's not really great um and it's it's
  not that bad it's just kind of like reasonable complaints um but it tends it also
  tends to be like very sort of like dry academic um it's the information it's very
  information dense which is good but um you know it's I still recommend it but I
  have I put these caveats on it also apparently Vander Coke is like a bit of a creep
  I think I don't know the details there but in the way that most older academics
  with some degree of notoriety become at some level um but you know still books are
  books um then the the one that I think of that I tend to recommend first to people
  is another one called um what my bones know by Stephanie Fu um which T which she
  is a person uh who grew up in like an abusive childhood environment and she became
  like a journalist so she wrote it's much more like me wari talking about her own
  sort of Journey to like understanding what cptsd is like and sort of like different
  treatments that she did and sort of like integrating into her own life so it's way
  less information dense but it's kind of like you know it feels a little more um
  modern and aware but it is very but but I don't think so the the Stephanie food
  book came later so she does talk about complex PTSD more specifically whereas the
  uh body keeps the score it just talks about PTSD and it doesn't really make that
  distinction between the two things um but yeah so the so in the context of the kind
  of stuff we've been talking about um if we think about the sort of the combination
  of the role of your nervous system primarily to be about predicting the future and
  integrating information and experiences to allow us to understand the the state
  of the world and the appropriate set of behaviors we should have in response to
  the state of the world um you can see where things like big traumatic events or
  even lowgrade long-term traumatic experiences can lead to kind of like a a slipping
  of the gears there and specifically in the ability of your body to to appropriately
  transfer between um the sort of the the figh ORF flight autonomic sort of the Fireflight
  sympathetic nervous system State and the more like resty relaxy um parasympathetic
  State and because basically your body is your your body your nervous system your
  central nervous system your peripheral nervous system your autonomic nervous system
  um is very sensitive to the outcome of the predictions that we make and we tend
  humans in general tend to be far more risk averse than we are reward celebratory
  um so like if you if you ask someone would you rather have $10 or a 10% chance of
  making $10000 rationally numerically those are the same offer but we massively prefer
  $10 rather than the possibility of $100 just because we tend to be more risk averse
  um one thing I like to say is like it would be a pretty shitty nervous shitty visual
  system that has that puts equal weight to everything in your visual field and notices
  the things that aren't tigers at the same level that it notices things that are
  tigers so we tend to be very risk averse and because of that we have we have the
  possibility or see like maybe the natural tendency to overweight bad experiences
  in helping us understand how we should interact with the world cuz if you have a
  situation where you know you are in a car accident or you sort of you're confronted
  with two doors one is blue one is green and you open the Green Door and you get
  punched in the face you open the blue door you get Cake and Candy um there is an
  after Thea kind of um speaking metaphorically and poetically after the fact you're
  your nervous system is going to do the the math of did we make a good prediction
  if we did we should reinforce it or did we make a bad prediction it it lead to us
  being harmed or or put into danger and if we did if we did have a situation where
  we we thought we were safe and then we we found a situation where we were we were
  harmed in some way your body is going to start looking for for things that you missed
  and things that you should have noticed before so that you can start thinking oh
  I should have noticed that that car was turning I should have noticed that the door
  was green and I and green means people are going to punch you when you open the
  door I don't know what that is um and so what can happen is what we tend to call
  hypervigilance uh where you're you you sort of Cu often times what ha because the
  world is cruel and capricious often times they're wasn't a thing that you could
  have noticed or at least not something that you really should have noticed given
  your experience um and so what will happen is your body will just like reach out
  for stuff and so sometimes like the lesson that your nervous system might learn
  was I let my guard down and that was the mistake and so and so what can lead to
  this kind of like disregulation of nervous system where your body might sort of
  associate being in a state of calm and relaxed especially if you're around other
  people especially if you're in like an environment that you know I don't know is
  in the world and so is sort of available for danger um and so you're it the the
  auto the the sympathetic nervous system might be unwilling to give up the re um
  at times when it needs to and that's where you can and it's thought that you could
  sort of measure that in the terms of heart rate variability where if you measure
  someone's heart rate and look for those transitions of highp speed versus low speed
  heart rate rate um on the scale of breasts you might not see that because the Paras
  the ner the sympathetic nerv system is holding on too tight and the parasympathetic
  system doesn't get the chance to do the slowing down that's supposed to happen and
  then you can imagine how that same type of in or i w say inability but difficulty
  in trading off between High State arousal versus like low low State um relaxation
  could lead to problems generally in health think about like that you know your gut's
  doing its job think about being able to sleep through the night and also think about
  being able to like interact with people around you and you know let your guard down
  around other people which is where a lot of the good parts of life tend to come
  from um and so that is the kind of that though that hypervigilance can be something
  that is sort of one of the consequences of traumatic experiences and specifically
  you know and then sort of like so the question then becomes from the perspective
  of people who care about humans having happy lives is like if that happens when
  that happens because unfortunately like the world is rough and we will encounter
  difficult difficulties um how do we sort of try to bring things back to Baseline
  um and what might work there and one thing that I also want to mention because I'm
  running out of time I think we're on a a good path but uh I wanted to sort of point
  out that um there's another concept which I'm not going to talk much about with
  which is the concept of resilience and the fact that not everybody that has a bad
  negative experience results in disordered autonomic regulation stuff um some people
  are able to bounce back and sort of what is it that defines or that can help us
  differentiate one versus the other and often times it's a question of Baseline a
  question of how much how many experiences have you had that show you that it is
  safe to be to relax and put your guard down and how many and how How likely have
  you are you to have experienced cases where that's not the case um and that's if
  you think about that in terms of your life and your development that is the reason
  why it is so important to try to protect children in to try to teach children that
  they can let their guard down and because if you think about the like the blue versus
  green door if you have a lifetime of experience with doors of all sorts of colors
  then and you open a green one and you get punched in the face you've opened enough
  green doors in your life that you know that it's not the door that's the problem
  and that was just you know I've opened a thousand green doors and only that one
  is the one that where I got hit but if I just started opening doors in my life and
  I've maybe never encountered doors of any color and I open a green door and I get
  hit in the face for the rest of my life like 100% of my at that point 100% of my
  experience tells me that green doors are unsafe and so you might develop a lifelong
  aversion to Green doors even when it's not appropriate and and I think one of the
  things that tends to come out of this literature and the this is discussed at length
  and the body keeps the score is really how critical it is for us to think about
  giving specifically young children the experience of safety and comfort in that
  early phase of their life and the and the the long-term consequences and effects
  that can come up not insurmountable they're not you know children of bad experiences
  are not doomed um but the early effects are going to be weighted more heavily than
  the later like early experiences are always going to be weighted more heavily than
  later experiences because in that early phase of your life you have less experiences
  to fall back on um and there's this kind of like mode of thinking that like we the
  world will always have the only way that we will ever like have a world we deserve
  optimistically is if we have three generations in a row where every child is get
  gets to experience stability and comfort and care for the first let's say 18 years
  of their life um three generations in a row which is because you know epigenetics
  and all that um and so yeah in the last couple minutes I want to talk just about
  yeah that the disordered hypervigilance response is this you can get into the space
  where like nothing is safe the world isn't safe I cannot let my guard down I cannot
  appropriately rest and relax um and in extreme cases that can be always and in the
  case of interpersonal trauma which unfortunately is a lot of it you can have that
  effect around other people and just like having a very difficult time being calm
  and being relaxed around other human beings um which is both the most appropriate
  response that you can imagine and also one of the things that is can be really um
  diminishing for your ability to sort of live a happy healthy productive not not
  productive let say effective productive is capitalism effective is internal motivation
  um and so again I'm I'm this is out of my field and I'm certainly not a a a therapist
  or a counselor or anything like that but a lot but I do find it very interesting
  that a lot of the treatments and therapies that we tend to associate with helping
  people get the gears back into into sync with each other has this um there's this
  there's this recurring pattern of tasks that cut across that full hierarchy of your
  nervous system and trying to engage your volitional Control Systems onto parts of
  your body on your nervous system that as close to that low level as it can get it
  you because you can't just decide to speed up your heart rate and slow down your
  heart rate but you can decide to hold your breath and take long breaths and take
  slow breaths so there's this concept of like the physiological sigh which I can't
  tell I think that's I think that's legit I I hav I don't know if that it's associated
  with Dan huberman who as far as I can tell is a legit scientist but I just I see
  him too often to trust him it's kind of like you you find your way in front of a
  camera too much for me to really trust you there but he does this research that
  kind of like it's you will see this in you'll feel this in your own life you'll
  see other people he just kind of like it's just that kind of like that like that
  feeling of like like an additional breath and then like a deep sigh and that is
  associated with some empirical basis with um like a reset like you're you're you
  know like typically it's like you're in like a an aroused like some height heightened
  State then you go and then it's kind of like your body kind of like releasing a
  lot of tension a lot of relaxing um you'll notice it in yourself and every time
  you do that like ask the question like why was I just why was I just cranked up
  what what was going on just now that was just going on and then now that I'm past
  that point what can I experience of that um this starts getting to the place of
  like the boundaries between like benevolent interaction between humans and like
  Maki aelian sort of like queuing into people if you're ever in an argument with
  somebody if you're ever in like like a difficult conversation with someone uh first
  of all try not to get too angry and upset and try to like Palm things down and take
  a pause and just just notice when they do that like because you'll be in the and
  then they like and then that's the point where you like that's when you can sort
  of engage more empathetically with the person because they have hypothetically just
  left that high arousal State and sort of entered into a more resty relaxy kind of
  space um and you can game it you can cheat yourself cuz your nervous system your
  body your internal systems are brilliant and in the same way of most things that
  are brilliant they're also dumb as hell and so you can your body and your mind and
  your brain will lie to you it will trick you it will say things that are wrong but
  you can sling that straight back and Li lie lie just as hard because you can and
  so it's also thing like you can so like if you're trying to like get yourself to
  relax and we know that breathing in tends to ramp up the sympathetic and breathing
  out tends to ramp up the parasympathetic just take a quick and then like just breathe
  in quickly and then exhale slowly and that's just you're just gaming the system
  there um I also have a personal F fascination with the with eye movements in this
  conversation as well because sort of as we've talked about in many cases throughout
  this semester and and what I find to like a very similar way that our breathing
  is on that boundary of volitional versus autonomic control our eye movements are
  in a similar kind of space where you will make you know tens and hundreds hundreds
  of thousands of eye movements every day the vast vast vast majority of which are
  not volitionally controlled it's just your central nervous system grabbing visual
  information from the places that some lower reach of your nervous system wanted
  the information from and we can control that and at some level not all the time
  but we can engage through some effort uh we can grab that handle and sort of control
  things that way and there's treatments like EMDR which is ey movement desensitivity
  and reprogramming or something like that that involve um making patterned eye movements
  like back and forth as a way to kind of like take some control back over your central
  nervous system um and then also like naming and noticing the sort of like you'll
  see this in like sematic therapies where it's like naming the emotion and sort of
  like pointing to it in your body and sort of like the kind of like engaging like
  the linguistic parts of your brain which is like the most like highle abstract like
  non-biological parts that exist so putting a name on a Feeling is similarly like
  Reaching Across these like you know aons of the phylogenic tree and um a lot of
  the therapies just kind of have that that nature of sort of like reaching from the
  top down to the bottom and sort of like resting control that way and so in the last
  two minutes I sort of want to thinking about this uh in terms of having a body having
  a nervous system living in this sort of weird meat puppet that has all these different
  systems trading off on each other some of which you can be aware of some of which
  you can control some of which you cannot and thinking about it in the context of
  like I've had you know dogs and cats and pets in my life and uh you know cats are
  kind of like having weird alien roommates that kind of like live and operate in
  the same space and like we like each other but we can't really communicate in the
  same way and I think that there's like parts of your nerv like your your your gut
  kind of feels like that like it's there it's it's it's you know you can operate
  in a certain way that gets certain Behavior but you can't directly control it in
  the same way that you can control your your muscular systems your eye movement systems
  dogs on the other hand is more like having an externalized aspect of your nervous
  system they actively Look to You to figure out how they should behave and you can
  control their behaviors in a much more direct way it's an independent being for
  sure but you can say calm down you can pet it you can if it barks it looks at you
  um and you can have that sort of a much more directed conversation with that externalized
  nervous system than you can with something like a cat and so I think that when we
  think about there's this concept of Neuroscience of the homunculus uh which is the
  the homunculus is the thing that you think that you are naively it's the feeling
  of like that you're like in a little driver seat in your brain and there's some
  externalized part of you that can look like look and examine the body that you're
  in and EXA some kind of control over it um but that doesn't exist there is not some
  additional smaller piece inside of you that internal small man in your brain small
  human in your brain that's just you that's just the system observing itself and
  that kind of of interaction is something that's kind of very um philosophically
  Frau and so in the last still have some number of seconds left uh victon Stein is
  a philosopher of language from like one of the progenitors of like our modern theories
  of like philosophy of science and he talked a lot about like the impossibility of
  language and the impossibility of like conveying human thought through language
  and the sort of sort of sad reality that you can never fully Express a human thought
  you can only approximate it over time he talked a lot about the like described as
  like having a beetle in a box and I have this box and I have this beetle in it and
  I can try to explain and describe what that is um what the beetle is like and it's
  got it's green it's got these little things on its head and I could talk about that
  for a thousand years but you'll never be able to actually see it you'll never get
  the same picture of the beetle as you could as if I could show it to you but I I
  can't and in the same but in the same way I realized now I'm out um that in the
  same way that nobody else can ever see the beetle that you have in your box you
  can never see the box and so I think that to really engage in trying that the strange
  and possible task of trying to know yourself and know your body it's a combination
  of being able to work to impossible task of describing your internal State and but
  also an aspect of like listening and hearing and sort of seeking help to actually
  get the full picture which you can never actually get from this first person perspective
  which is all we really have so yeah cuz if you're going to be doomed to push an
  impossible boulder up a hill forever you might as well have company so all right
  that's it thanks for the class um have a good break and I will see you

  description: 'Lecture Outline - https://github.com/HumanMovementNeuroscience/HMN24-course/blob/main/lectures/automoic-nervous-system/ans-trauma-lecture.md\n\n*[ai-gen''d
    description, see below]\n\nThe lecture discusses the autonomic nervous system
    (ANS), focusing on its role in trauma and neurophysiological effects. It explains
    the division of the ANS into sympathetic (fight-or-flight) and parasympathetic
    (rest-and-relax) systems, and how these interact with the central and peripheral
    nervous systems. The vagus nerve is highlighted for its role in gut-brain communication.
    Heart rate variability is used to measure ANS function, with trauma potentially
    disrupting this balance, leading to PTSD. The lecture distinguishes between acute
    trauma and complex PTSD, emphasizing the importance of early life experiences
    in developing resilience. Treatments often involve exercises to regain control
    over autonomic functions. The session concludes with philosophical insights on
    self-awareness and understanding one''s nervous system.\n\n\nSummary of the Lecture
    on the Autonomic Nervous System and Trauma\n\n\n-     Focus is on the autonomic
    nervous system (ANS) and its relation to trauma and neurophysiological effects.\n\n-     The
    ANS is divided into the sympathetic (fight-or-flight) and parasympathetic (rest-and-relax)
    systems.\n\n-     The central nervous system (CNS) includes the brain and spinal
    cord, while the peripheral nervous system (PNS) includes sensory and motor neurons.\n\n-     The
    enteric nervous system, related to the gut, is becoming more recognized for its
    complexity.\n\n-     The vagus nerve, part of the parasympathetic system, is crucial
    for communication between the gut and CNS.\n\n -    Heart rate variability is
    a key measure of ANS function, indicating the balance between sympathetic and
    parasympathetic activity.\n\n-     Neurovisceral integration theory suggests a
    healthy nervous system smoothly transitions between states of arousal and relaxation.\n\n-     Trauma
    can disrupt this balance, leading to conditions like PTSD, characterized by hypervigilance
    and difficulty relaxing.\n\n-     The lecture distinguishes between acute trauma
    (single events) and complex PTSD (chronic exposure to stress).\n\n-     Treatments
    often involve engaging volitional control over autonomic functions, like breathing
    exercises.\n\n-     The importance of early life experiences in shaping resilience
    and the ability to manage stress is emphasized.\n\n-     The lecture concludes
    with philosophical reflections on self-awareness and the limitations of understanding
    one''s own nervous system.\n\n---\n Keywords:\n#autonomicnervoussystem\n#sympatheticnervoussystem\n#parasympatheticnervoussystem

  text: okay hello everybody settle down um so yeah welcome to this Bonus Week um
    thank you for showing up sort of the like so because this class doesn't have a
    class the first week of the semester because semester starts on Wednesday we it's
    like this like weird little half week is kind of part of that um so appreciate
    you showing up uh if you're watching this on a video we didn't show up I understand
    um and what was I going to say yeah so it's kind of the Cadence of the semester
    actually been working up pretty nicely so last time we got the had the fun little
    walk through of my prior research experience with sort of hypothetically sufficient
    background to cover it and now this is the second to final class of the semester
    and um yeah so it's kind of like a little bit of a bonus lecture um and so like
    I said so this time I'm going to talk about your autonomic nervous system and
    particularly as it relates to such things as trauma and the neurophysiological
    effects of trauma on the body and the sort of the ways that that kind of like
    interacts and overlaps with all the things we've been learning this semester about
    how bodies work and the weird balancing act that we have between like the parts
    of our bodies and nervous system that we have direct hypothetically direct FAL
    access and control in the parts that are kind of like the ocean that we float
    on top of and sort of like the ways that those things play in with each other
    um the so next week is going to be the final class of the semester there is no
    proper final so um I'm going to spend that time kind of doing wrapup and just
    presenting my class project of trying to make sense of the tremendous amount of
    you put into the server um I'll come up with some I the basic plan for I'll have
    like some kind of like a official assignment looking thing on canvas about like
    what to do to kind of wrap up your efforts here and I I'll probably I'll spend
    Thanksgiving kind of putting a couple little extra bells and whistles on the bot
    and sort of like some of the visualizations I've been showing throughout the semester
    um and then there'll be some kind of assignment like object that will look something
    like hey make sure you've had at least this many chats here and there and then
    a kind of like a an outro type of conversation where you'll had kind of a like
    an introductory aspect and so there's going to be kind of like an exit interview
    type of thing where you'll talk to the bot about at that point I will have with
    any luck a way of like extracting your specific conversations and sort of doping
    that into the conversation and then you can kind of like discuss with the bot
    about like the blah blah Blas of how the

  text: semester went and what you discovered and found and it'll be fun to look at
    um yeah so let's get into this so I dropped a link to the sort of the sloppy notes
    that I have on the GitHub page um and kind of try to go through this in as let's
    see what I'm trying to do here see that yeah sure why not that's fine yeah so
    going to try to just like run through a lot of this this was kind of um so this
    area of neuroscience at the sort of the autonomic level is not something that
    I have like direct professional experience in so a lot of the stuff we've been
    talking about this semester is on the kind of the perceptual motor side of life
    and um like eye movements and motion capture and that kind of biomechanic stuff
    and that is an area which I you know am a like contributing expert or whatever
    in that particular area of research so I have a uh you know I have the awareness
    of that field in this in the sense of like you know knowing the literature and
    also like understanding the methods and sort of like being very steeped in the
    culture of people who research that type of thing um this is getting closer and
    this is getting into areas that like I don't have that same relationship with
    um so it's stuff that I kind of know a lot about in various ways but the ways
    in which I know it is kind of like uh some like a strange Middle Ground between
    like what we might call what we often call like sort of the the concept of like
    an intelligent lay person which is someone who's not a professional expert in
    a particular field um but it's just kind of like a like a smart person who's like
    looked into it and read up read up about it um a lot of sort of scientific writing
    is sort of intentionally targeting that sort of intelligent lay person type of
    audience um so it's like I've read some books about it but I haven't like done
    deep research on it I've never done like direct uh research in the area um but
    it has this nice aspect because of my background that it all the sort of the Popular
    Science type of stuff I like to look into about it is connected to stuff that
    I do have that kind of deep knowledge of um so sort of you can like poke around
    and sort of like watch throughout the lecture about like the kind of the ways
    that like the stuff that we have been talking about kind of folds in and it's
    kind of interesting for me to kind of examine like the places where it feels like
    because I'm not in that area I'm sort of missing some things and other ways in
    which because I am kind of an outsider to some extent like a nearby Outsider that
    the unique perspectives that I have kind of like like oh that might actually be
    a contribution into that type of thing

  text: um so yeah let's kind of let's get into it um yeah and so um so let's talk
    about your various nervous systems uh you have one main one which is roughly speaking
    your entire body uh and then there's a SE there's several other kind of delineations
    of your nervous system and the ones that we've been talking about the most we
    tend to talk about the most in the field that we call Neuroscience is the central
    nervous system so the central nervous system is the sort of the thing that you
    tend to think about when you think about uh Neuroscience uh central nervous system
    um and specifically it is sort of this big lumpy pink thing on top that we call
    the brain the cortex um and then the peripheral nervous system is the other sort
    of side of that so the central nervous system is it's your cortex which is the
    pink wrinkly bit on top um and it's also lumped together with the subcortical
    regions which is like your cerebellum which is a little bumpy bit on the back
    um uh subcortical areas like we talk about basil ganglia and Thalamus and sort
    of those parts that are kind of like wrapped up inside of the big pink wrinkly
    bit and also your spine and things like that so these are the areas that we tend
    sort of the basic functional delineation we tend to put for the central nervous
    system is that it's the area where quote unquote processing occurs where information
    that has sort of come in through the senses is kind of like chunked around and
    sort of changed form and then often kind of turned into the bases of a motor Behavior
    a motor action um but of course that distinction like everything here is a cartoon
    version of reality it's it's a it's a pretty reasonable cleave point to split
    things apart into but it has all sorts of overlaps in Gray areas as as nature
    tends to do um particular in areas like the eye like in your retina or arguably
    in sort of like the weird cacophony of sensors on your skin there's stuff that
    would presumably normally be put into like the peripheral nervous system the sort
    of the sensory and motor aspects of the nervous system that really do things that
    kind of resemble what we would call computations the distinction immediate distinction
    between the central nervous system as the thing yeah so like this cartoon right
    here um where you have the central nervous system is this wonderful little off-
    Center brain like shape and then the spinal cord and then your peripheral nervous
    system is all the little you know sort of like often kind of pejoratively thought
    of as like just like the wiring so the things that bring sensory information from
    the external

  text: parts of your body into the central nervous system and the part and the sort
    of flip-flopped wires that send motor commands from the central nervous system
    out to the periphery um so this is the sort of cartoon version that that will
    you'll often see in textbooks and it's not wrong it's not incorrect it's not a
    bad way to describe things but it's sort of inherently incomplete and cartoonified
    uh sort of in the way that we often do when we try to parse nature which as we've
    discussed in many ways and many days uh in sort of classically impossible thing
    to do um and so Central first is peripheral nervous system that's T that's mostly
    what we've been talking about here and that kind of basic distinction there um
    but there are other kind of like subd distinctions that we can make into other
    sort of aspects of the sort of the all the different sort of nerve groups that
    we find in the body so generally speaking Neuroscience is sort of the science
    of neurons um and your neurons sort of sit in these sort of different functional
    roles in your body uh and I'm realizing kind of like as I was saying this that
    like even this distinction that I'm about to make is also kind of like a flip
    like a chopped up version of reality so kind of when I sat down to write these
    notes I was like oh yeah you got your central nervous system your peripheral nervous
    system and then you've got the enteric nervous system and your autonomic nervous
    system but I realized kind of like as I was showing this that those could arguably
    be just you could think of them as like four distinct things or you could consider
    them to be like subcategories of the two things that I just mentioned um or you
    could just say language is incomplete and we sort of name things as they are useful
    to us um so central nervous system peripheral nervous so broadly speaking central
    nervous system is like the central processor and the main computational aspects
    of your neurons peripheral nervous system is kind of like sensory motor components
    um inic nervous system which is a word that I learned this morning is the fancy
    term for your your gut um which is one of those areas that kind of like I remember
    when I started in grad school around 2008 was when I think people kind of started
    to really understand that your like your gut is really like its own kind of thing
    like it's there's lot going on in the way that the nerves are connected and sort
    of you know who decides like when various tubes will start doing peristalsis and
    which gland should secrete what into which area at which time um and all that
    kind of like not to mention like your whole the microbiome that's going on um

    schedule it's sort of showing up like a decade or so after it started to sort
    of come up in the scientific literature um so we don't have as much to say about
    the anic nervous system but it will come back into the conversation um because
    it sort of it interacts with the autonomic nervous system um in a way that's kind
    of like interesting we talk about sort of closer to the bottom there um and then
    the last the last bit the sort of the star of the show today which is your autonomic
    nervous system um Auto sort of you know like the root of automatic um and your
    autonomic nervous system is the part of your nervous system that handles like
    the basics like the sort of the keep you alive stuff the kind of the lowlevel
    like what do you need to survive as an individual organism as well as a species
    type of system um I've talked about I think I mentioned at some point in this
    that the the nervous system um particularly in the central area so and that's
    so in the distinction I mentioned before like one there might be folks out there
    who would argue that the enic nervous system is an as is sort of a subcomponent
    of the peripheral nervous system um which who knows if they would uh be able to
    defend that position to relevant experts um but the same people who like to chop
    things up into subcategories would also place the autonomic nervous system as
    a subcomponent of the central nervous system um and see if I can brain stem and
    so often times and when you look at the the brain and the sort of the central
    nervous system and that kind of stuff you can kind of get a map of uh of how uh
    the sort of the the vi the phoenic history of that part of the nervous system
    uh by going from the inside out so as you sort of from the the the sort of the
    innermost part of your nervous system is typically the oldest part um and then
    as you sort of like go outward kind of like the layers of an onion or a flour
    or something like that the stuff that you see on the outside edges of everything
    tends to be the most recently developed the most you know the neocerebellum this
    pink wrinkling bit is sometimes called the neoc cellum is the new part of the
    cerebellum sorry the Neo cortex the new part of the cortex and then the same kind
    of story is true in smaller scale um although smaller scale in terms of volume
    but larger scale in terms of number of neurons um at the cerebellum level where
    there is a similar kind of distinction between the the middle parts are the oldest
    parts and as you sort of go outward you get the more phylogenically new parts
    and then the outside is the neocerebellum which is the part that thought to be
    associated with like tool use and like

    talking about things like the autonomic nervous system we're talking really about
    like these inner inside Parts like the really deep down Parts like closer to your
    things like your brain stem and your medulla ablong and it kind of lives in this
    space of like if you think of your central controller as a kind of like it's like
    a fist like this is your uh like your your um your spine coming down and then
    the fist thing on top that's where most of the the really deep down subcortical
    regions tend to live and these tend to be the very very old aspects of your nervous
    system and then the cortex is sort of described it at one point as like it's kind
    of like the flower on top of the bush like if you think of like a rose bush there's
    this big there's this beautiful red part on the top and we spend a lot of time
    thinking about the beautiful red flower on top of the brose Bush but really when
    you look at the actual plant it's mostly Bush and then the flower is just kind
    of this really neat interesting aspect um but strictly speaking that bush without
    a rose would still be able to do most of the normal Bush things that it needs
    to do um minus creating more bushes I think that this my my botney tends to break
    down in this area um and so there's kind of this is also where you'll often hear
    kind of conversations around like the mamalian brain versus like your your reptile
    brain um where the pink wrinkly cortex bit is the part that tends to be associated
    with the your your mammal bits and then the deep down Parts is the stuff that
    we tend to associate with like The Reptilian Parts because those guys evolved
    you know much longer ago um but they like are the rest of our most of the rest
    all the rest that I'm aware of of our vertebrate friends um they share a lot of
    basic functionalities in terms of like having a heart having a nervous system
    um and having a centralized set of neurons that are sort of that run most of the
    show this is in sort of uh opposition to things like insects or you know seapods
    like octopus and stuff like that where they have a more distributed nervous system
    where you don't have the same kind of distinction between like this like high
    concentration of important parts in the middle and then sort of this more diffuse
    set of respons abilities in the periphery um all of our verbate friends especially
    our tetrapod sort of two arms two legs friends tend to have a similar sort of
    that's that's the sort of like the the Terminus of the vertebra of the of the
    of the sorry the spinal cord so all of our Cordata friends have a similar shape

  text: for survival um and it is at this point that I get to make uh a joke which
    all Neuroscience professors are required to make in undergraduate classrooms which
    is to say that the ANS handles the four FS of survival which is feeding fighting
    uh feeding fighting fleeing and procreation is the classic joke um and that is
    sort of the the basic idea of like these are the things that you need to be able
    to do you need to be able to eat food you need to be able to fight when you have
    to run away when you have to and then do the complex behaviors that sort of proliferate
    the species and the autonomic nervous system is sort of the part that tends to
    is thought to handle a lot of that um and as we are chopping things up into increasingly
    small boxes uh your autonomic nervous system is also in a cartoonified version
    of the world consisting considered to uh involve two main aspects which we tend
    to refer to um actually I found even though I do I do a lot of this where I like
    I looking up images I just like searched Google images for like the topic in question
    um which always feels a little bit lazy but also kind of like it's I like sort
    of showing the the process a bit and it's I find it especially helpful in this
    case because you get to see just different types of cartoons and the diff and
    this is going to become relevant in the with the next search like most of these
    are pretty okay um but you get to see kind of like the different ways that we
    tend to talk about these things and different sort of pictures we tend to use
    to describe these things and some of them have greater or lesser detail and some
    of them have more or less resemblance to sort of like the actual thing that you
    might see if you were to take that organism and chop it and take pictures of it
    whereas others are far more cartoonified um but I think it's really important
    to notice that all of these are cartoons none of these are accurate and none of
    these represent what you would see if you chopped up any actual human and certainly
    don't represent what you would see if you chopped up all possible humans which
    I don't recommend doing either of those things um but it's sort of like I think
    we we tend to have we very naturally I think tend towards this fiction that they're
    sort of that these pictures somehow represent reality um and really they represent
    the best approximation we have for sort of carving up reality into conceptual
    boxes that are simple enough for us to be able to wrap our heads around and in
    the same way that you know this like this cartoon of the brain has less details
    than this cartoon of the brain um but they're both cartoons and they both sort
    of have these like false separations of this thing this part is that color this
    part is that color we call this part the parietal lobe and this part the occipital
    lobe and we don't draw these colors in random places for no reason

    nature we didn't crack open the brain and see a stamp that said this is the parietal
    lobe we just discovered that if we call this thing the certain thing then we can
    say stuff about the whole region which tends to be more true than it would be
    if we talked about a different part of the brain so the occipital lobe is where
    the visual cortex lives and so if we talk about Vision we're mostly talking about
    here but that doesn't that you're not going to find visy stuff in other parts
    of the nervous system you absolutely will so that's yeah yeah and as there's going
    to be a particular search that is going to show a very Stark distinction between
    like scientifi stuff and the kind of like woow woo stuff like a lot of we're going
    to be getting towards really touches on woo like the sort of like getting into
    the kind of like from the edge of like what you might call like proper science
    which I wouldn't recommend down to like popular conceptions of Science and down
    to like what we might call pseudo science which is sort of not doesn't track re
    doesn't track scientific understanding in the same way that we would hope things
    like um you know more popular science approximations do where Popular Science
    is like is like this kind of stuff like it's you know I would even argue that
    things like undergraduate textbooks on Neuroscience are on the edge of Popular
    Science because they are the versions of the story that we tell to people who
    don't have a lot of background in the region and don't and wouldn't benefit from
    sort of seeing the way that it tends to be worked on in professional level where
    it's just much more murky and messy and sort of less coherent so we tend to start
    with different layers of cartoon ification and then we sort of try to slowly back
    you into the the reality of the world Which is far more chaotic and mixed up uh
    yeah so autonomic nervous system um is the the two sort of main aspects and branches
    of that are what we tend to refer to as the sympathetic and the parasympathetic
    nervous systems um and those again cartoonified distinction um tends to be stuff
    that we associate with the um you know on the one side you have your fight ORF
    flight aspects sort of the the cranked up um high speed high you know the you
    know getting into a fight type of uh aspects of inhabiting a body which must survive
    in a world where where in predation has evolved um and then the parasympathetic
    nervous system which is what we tend to refer to as the rest and relax aspects
    of our nervous system and that's the part of you know sleeping digesting food

    the the deeper sort of deeper aspects of this um area you know doing things like
    reading you know like scanning review articles like reading the Wikipedia page
    which I've always recommend for any new domain um and just kind of like checking
    the things that I think I know and seeing if if I can find some connection to
    more established uh research um there is as often as the case um a lot of Shifting
    around in the way that we tend to think about the autonomic nervous system and
    the sympathetic parasympathetic divide and who has what role and how should we
    think about them and is it like and so when I talk about this um I'm going to
    be trying to sort of do an appropriate mixing of like yeah I try I'll try to appropriately
    Elevate the the things that I would mostly say about it which tends to be the
    older stuff with what I'm picking up appears to be kind of like most of the shift
    towards a new new ways of thinking and in general anytime I talk about something
    that seems simple that's the stuff that is just it's never that simple so anytime
    I say somethingone like here's the autonomic nervous system nervous system there's
    two parts this one and that one and that one does this and this one does that
    all of those kind of like hard delineations and hard labelings and and sort of
    you know simplified division of labor that's the stuff where if you actually poked
    at it and dug into it the answer is always going to be that that's it's more complicated
    than that and there's and that those are just you know those are the the cartoon
    stories that we tell because it's a combination of what we used to think which
    we tend to used to think that things were simpler than we have found out found
    them out to be um and also that that is the distinction that we tend to start
    with when we're explaining things to people because it's not always um it's not
    the most functional thing to just start every conversation with it's too complex
    to understand in 15 lifetimes so uh we tend to start with with the cartoons um
    so yeah so the sympathetic parasympathetic nervous system fight ORF flight rest
    or relax we'll we'll stick with that rough delineation for now um very hard to
    remember these things this is one of the many areas of science ESP Neuroscience
    where some asshol a couple hundred years ago decided to name the two things words
    that sound almost exactly the same um like afferent and ephant for the sensory
    versus motor nerves which I still don't know which one is which I think afferent
    is happens after the event so it's a sensory and then ephant is affects the world
    was the motor but who I'll bet whoever they thought they were so clever when they
    came up with that and and I have I'll hate them forever um so we tend to rely

  text: on uh pneumonics for that and so my particular pneumonic for the sympathetic
    and parasympathetic nervous systems is that the sympathetic is the fight ORF flight
    one because you're just beat the guy up and now you're sympathetic for them uh
    versus the parasympathetic because you're like eating a pair and you're relaxing
    and eating a pair it's not a good pneumonic but it's the best one I've got um
    I realized as I was doing this that like the the would probably be spectacular
    at pneumonics so as some percentage of you go off to medical school and are forced
    to memorize things which I am I personally am allowed to skim through um that
    might be a pretty good use of that technology um so yeah so we have so sympathetic
    parasympathetic sympathetic is the figh or flight and the one of the distinctions
    that I that I came across when I was looking into this uh was that one of the
    ways that we have started to add some complexity to that basic fight ORF flight
    versus rest and relax is that the perhaps a better way to think of it is that
    your sympathetic nervous system is the part that is tuned for high-speed fastpaced
    sort of low latency actions um that require like arousal and typically the activation
    of like your muscular skeletal system um in order to react to the world at a very
    short time scale whereas the parasympathetic nervous system is the part that handles
    the slower calmer quieter processes that sort of play out over long periods of
    time um things like digestion and um and sleeping and stuff like that versus like
    getting into a fight or something like that um and then of course there are many
    aspects of our behavior that require some combination of both um so like think
    about like playing sports or something like that where good performance requires
    this combination of really fast and precise action um with a calmness that is
    that is that allows you to sort of avoid going into kind of like panicky State
    um and there are all various other uh socio personal physical physiological processes
    that similarly require a complex balance of arousal and relaxation um so yeah
    and so you so when you look up these autonomic nervous system you see a lot of
    pictures like this where you say parasympathetic does this sympathetic system
    does that uh parasympathetic system attaches to these parts of your your body
    and your parasympathetic attaches to these parts um and in you know of course
    in many ways it's like these are reasonable things to say I also believe like

    know some nice tables a lot of physiology stuff which never in my area of research
    like I tend to be able to avoid in learning too much specifics about this type
    of thing but they you know these letters and numbers are uh vertebrae and sort
    of when they where they tend you know T6 t7 T8 that's their Thor the sixth and
    seventh and eth vertebrae of your thoracic region versus you have your cervical
    and your thoracic and your Lumbar and blah blah blah um then down here in the
    function you get these nice sort of lists here um typically the um aspects of
    your sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems they tend to be paired with
    one another um and so the you know the parasympathetic connection to your your
    gut uh starts to digestion and starts peristalsis and secretion of you know various
    gops into various places um in your sympathetic Ser server system tends to shut
    that down um gives a sense that like if you're going to get into a fight you don't
    want to be wasting a bun of energy like digesting stuff um and similarly yeah
    sort of as you sort of look at these a lot of these things you can think of as
    distin distinction between the stuff that you have to do to generally survive
    um being turned on by your parasympathetic nervous system and the things that
    are sort of like that you know the the optional subsystems uh that you would want
    to turn off if you were in like a you know a fight ORF flight sort of environment
    um being um activated by the sympathetic nervous system or yeah you're yeah you
    don't digest things when you're in a fight it's sort of we're not operating at
    that time scale right now we'll digest this later is the basic thought um and
    there are some interesting connections which we will get back to if I manage my
    time properly um around things like your eyes and your iris and your sort of like
    you know pupil construction and things like that um and I discovered this fun
    interesting thing that like uh parasympathetic affects your the lens inside of
    your eye that part that you can sort of like like if you look at something and
    like fuzz out like make the world defocus you're you're controlling the lens inside
    of your eye and those muscles are assoc are sort of interact with that sympathetic
    parasympathetic divide in an interesting way um so back to the cartoons uh there
    are some particular anatomical aspects of your nervous system um that sort of
    tend to be associated with these different with the Sy sythetic and Paris sympathetic
    parts of your body um and this would be the

  text: place where if you were on the side of saying that your the ANS is not a part
    of your central nervous system you would point to these anatomical features to
    say see look this thing lives outside of the spine so it's part of the peripheral
    vers or or it's I wouldn't want to say it's part of the peripheral but it's definitely
    not part of the central because it's not it's outside of your spine but it's very
    close to that so it's hard to say quite what uh yeah so so the argument continues
    um and in particular your sympathetic nervous system is related to an interesting
    aspect called the sympathetic trunk which are pairs of they're pairs of ganglia
    that live sort of like that run down the edge of your spine on the outside so
    ganglia is just a cluster of neurons um we talk about the um retinal ganglion
    cells that sort of pool together um different photo receptors a lot of things
    like you know insects and sort of creatures that don't have a central nervous
    system they do tend to have ganglia so with things like you know dragonfly they
    have a gangli and bulbs that handle the the visual inputs and motor outputs um
    there which you know then when you start asking the question of well is the what's
    the difference between a ganglion and like a central nervous system it's like
    well that's where we're getting into Linguistics so it's not really defined um
    but let me find so sympathetic trunk um so yeah so they and so these little bulul
    of neuro of neurons that sort of run down your spine um that's the sort of the
    the home of where your uh sympathetic nervous system tends to interact with your
    body and it let's see it sort of like it runs like from the so this is that sort
    of Knob thing on the top um this is down into your so this is L5 which is like
    right around here and then you s this is the it's called the CIS aquinus at the
    bottom here because it looks like a horse tail um and so all down the spine you
    have these sort of paired sets of gangan bulbs um which is the puff that we tend
    to associate with the sympathetic nervous system and these bulbs get activated
    um and sort of they start that that tradeoff from oh I think we might be in a
    fight oh I think we need to sort of ramp up the general activation of the nervous
    system and these parts this is these gangling cells handle that kind of like the
    that cranking up of arousal um and I think about this a lot uh so in the same
    way that we have to be careful about thinking about um these cartoonified versions

    that I'm about to do which is starting to like use your own personal experience
    of being inside of one of these weird Meat Puppets um to make sense of some of
    the stuff that you see in terms of the anatomy um you have to be careful about
    it but you don't have to be that careful about it um because if you think about
    what the nervous system what the sympathetic nervous system does is it tends to
    be a part of like being startled being scared be like oh my God there's something
    over there one of my favorite uh nervous system responses which is the startle
    reflex uh which is a part of our ner nervous system that we share with house flies
    um which is like large blooming object and you kind of have that that jump thing
    and there's there's for me there's this strong association between those types
    of startle responses and like a light like lightning going down your spine there's
    kind of like a like a shocking moment um and I was very sort of fascinated to
    discover when I was learning about this stuff sort of um I would say a little
    bit embarrassingly late um as in my career as a neuroscientist partially because
    of I started as a philosophy major so I missed a lot of the standard undergraduate
    introduction stuff um and sort of just realizing that like cuz what these things
    are doing is they're doing things like telling your body to dump adrenaline they're
    they're cranking up your your muscles and increasing the sensitivities and you
    know like lowering pain sensitivities and increasing like sort of like low like
    lowlevel Activation so you can respond quicker to stimuli that kind of like like
    Wolverine kind of like response comes from these things sort of getting cranked
    on um and that cranking on of course that AR describing like a very high level
    of crank but sort of the the sematic experience of having this kind of like lightning
    running down your spine associated with those sort of startle responses and then
    like academically learning that that startle response is associated with a set
    of paired gangan cells that run down your spine it's one of those things it's
    like is that the same thing or am I just telling stories to myself is there a
    difference between those things and the cartoons we see here um who knows um but
    yeah so from an anatomical perspective uh the sympathetic nervous system is associated

    it's like there's almost like a subway map aspect to these cartoons where it's

    associated with like you know um activation versus uh inhibition and stuff like
    that and you know this part connects to that part and actually no sorry these
    ones up here are more peripheral but um but yeah and so speaking of these blue
    lines so the red lines here are the sort of the sympathetic and then the blue
    lines here correspond to the parasympathetic and this is the place where I have
    to put a Big Woo disclaimer because um we're now going to start talking about
    such a thing as the vagus nerve which is a real thing that exists it is uh a real
    anatomical feature um but and you're going to and it's it's used in a lot of sort
    of as we're we're now going to start getting into the space of like how do you
    like how do you calm your nervous system how do you like relate to the world and
    in that region a lot of people you know goodmed good-hearted people doing their
    best can often find their ways into ways of of explaining the world that sort
    of blur the line between this is like useful things to tell humans and this is
    like empirical things that we believe is true about the physical world um and
    I'll give you a couple hints about how you can like tell which part of the landscape
    you're in um as you do things like search for the vagal nerve so vagal nerve uh
    is a really neat really neat guy and it is um it's the longest nerve in your body
    by a very by a very uh high factor vagel is like the same roote as like vagrant
    or like whatever else like it means wandering it's like I was going to say Voyage
    but I don't think that's actually the same thing but uh it means wandering maybe
    the same I don't know so the nerve is is called the wondering nerve and it kind
    of see so this is a place where like I have to really pick my pictures carefully
    because a lot of these are cartoons that I wouldn't want to be wouldn't want to
    put behind like I don't know what this guy this they're missing some really important
    parts here um this is a nice picture I think so the Vegas nerve starts um so the
    sympathetic trunk sort of runs down the spine and sort of has these aspects that
    sort of go into the spine at the various vertebrae the vagel Nerf starts it sort
    of like squirts out of your um like your brain stem at the uh where 153 uh I've

  text: cranial nerve X structure I don't know one of the cranial nerves yeah it's
    one of the cranial nerves so at for you Future Doctor types you will be forced
    to look at many this list of cranial nerves will become very familiar to you um
    cranial nerves optic nerve is one of them the ocul motor nerves that controls
    eye movements is one of them um it's basically just the fa the nerves that control
    your facial expressions are among some of these um and then the vagal nerve is
    one of them so it it it breaks out of your central nervous system in in the cranium
    and then sort of runs down through your body and like wraps around that's not
    helpful open image um so this is all one neuron and it has many so the with neurons
    like the long parts are called the axons then you have um I'm actually I was going
    to say dendrites but I'm not sure if they dendrites are at the beginning or the
    end but it's kind of this is all one long neuron and it tends to go down and it
    wraps around a lot of the the viscera of your body like all the the goopy bits
    in the middle including your your respiratory system um and down into this sort
    of gut part of your body and so like when I earlier when I talked about the anic
    nervous system the sort of the gut based nervous system um it does this is its
    main mode of communication this is the main mode of communication between your
    your guts and the central nervous system is through this interaction through of
    the the V nerve and um and then similar so and so similarly to um come back to
    this a little bit more in a second here but I kind of think similar to the way
    that the that um the sympathetic trunk I tend to associate with that like shocking
    feeling of being surprised um you can think about all the different like emotions
    and feelings that you have that sort of relate to like sinking feelings in your
    chest or like your guts feeling all tied up or you know like empty things in the
    pit of your stomach right here and I had a similar sort of like reaction when
    I first saw pictures of this and I was like oh yeah that's where all of those
    if I were to point to those feelings it's like yeah this these in these sort of
    spaghetti cacophonies of parts of the Vegas nerve um and yeah so where we at with

  text: the yeah so those are so those are kind of like obviously there's many many
    more details um but the yeah so oh sorry I so I guess there's some parts that
    come out the bottom too I don't know um but yeah so your Vegas nerve has these
    kind of like whereas the sympathetic system has it sort of like runs down the
    spine your parasympathetic tends to be associated with these sort of like long
    range connections through the vagus nerve which sort of are not as connected to
    the kind of like the muscular skeletal aspects of your body um and so before when
    I was we were looking at that sort of list of different functions and um you know
    which part is like what the effect of parasympathetic activation is on these given
    processes and given organs versus sympathetic that trade-off is thought to be
    mediated through um sort of uh what's the word uh ah there's a fancy word for
    this but it's like the tradeoff type of activation where uh one of these system
    tends to crank up while the other tends to crank down um you get the same kind
    of effect when we I think I talked about this more in some some of the subgroups
    but in the like the ways that are reflexes trade off when we're doing things like
    walking where I my as I'm walking my feet are going are sort of cycling through
    stance and swing um with a very tight spatio temporal coupling um where as my
    foot hits the ground my leg muscles have to be stiff enough and strong enough
    to support the weight of my body but then the second my foot leaves the ground
    they get all floppy so they can swing through um without having to like burn a
    bunch of energy and the um the transition from that stance to swing at the level
    of your limbs during things like Locomotion is um is of is mediated from your
    upper levels of your nervous system um through like the top upper part of the
    motor hierarchy uh often through the um Shifting the gain of different sort of
    lowlevel reflexes so like the stretch reflex that tends to sort of resist motion
    um that transition from stance to swing at from each step is sort of mediated
    at some level by your higher you know I think at that point it's like your cerebellum
    in that part of region um uh shifting how the the gain on that lowlevel stretch
    reflex is where a lot of that um The Stance to swing transitions tend to happen
    and there's a similar kind of like uh reciprocal activation that's the TR I was
    looking forward to there's a reciprocal activation component of like the sympathetic
    and parasympathetic nervous systems

  text: here um and so yeah and so like I said I could we could teach several classes
    on the specific Anatomy associated with these systems but in terms of like high
    level broadcut cartoonified versions of the story um the the main anatomical aspects
    of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are associated with the
    sympathetic trunk and those sort of paired gangan cells in the sympathetic case
    and then that vagus nerve sort of wandering through your body in the parasympathetic
    sense um and so yeah so moving into sort more functional space uh the main so
    the idea there is to sort of like this transition of your nervous system into
    states of sort of you know figh ORF flight high pressure low Time Low Time scale
    um leave it all on the field types of of activation of your of your sympathetic
    nervous system versus the lower this longer time scale slower relax of restorative
    aspects in uh as your parasympathetic system takes over and we're going to talk
    a little most of the rest of the class is going to be talking about that transition
    and your ability to appropriately um mediate between the different states that
    your your body should be in given the state of the world that you're in um in
    specific speically I want to start talking about this in terms of a of a measurable
    aspect so a lot of the research the behavioral Research into these areas of the
    nervous system autonomic nervous system looks at things at that are that are typically
    handled by those uh by your ANS um the main one being um things like your breathing
    and your heart rate um and specifically your heart rate because uh your breathing
    is obviously an important aspect of survival um it is also available for voluntary
    control like you most of the time that you're breathing your breathing is happening
    on its own but you can choose to hold your breath you can choose to inhale you
    can choose to Exhale and you can sort of enact that volitional control um to some
    extent like you cannot hold your breath until you die but you can hold your breath
    for a good long time and I I don't know if you could pass out by holding your
    breath but don't try it um and whereas your heart is sort of less it's it's it's
    like one layer deeper like you you cannot control your heart rate in the same
    way that you control your breath and you can't control your breath in the same
    way that you can control your hand um so your heart rate is sort of at is like
    one layer deeper in your nervous system where you no longer have that kind of
    Direct volutional Control and so looking at that as a measurement um becomes a
    really interesting and valuable sort of window into the the status and the functionality
    that's going on at that at

  text: that layer of your nervous system control um and there's this and one of the
    main sort of Concepts that comes out is the uh this notion of heart rate variability
    so there is a certain kind of like naive mechanistic sort of like robot brained
    thinking about the heart where uh which I believe for quite some time um which
    was that if you you would imagine that if you're a doctor assessing the health
    of someone's nervous system you would look at their heart rate and you would look
    for heart rate variability and you would say heart rate variability is good when
    it's low we like it when our heart beats on a very regular basis and sort of like
    like a metronome and the variability of timing between beats is low that's when
    your heart is doing its job very well um but it turns out that although this is
    you know caveat caveat around this um that actually tends not to be the case and
    when we think about things like heart rate variability one of the things that
    people that we look for as if I was a medical type of doctor is um is there's
    a there's a healthy range of variability that if you are not showing then that's
    a s that's a a sign that there's something going a skew under the hood um and
    so briefly just like if you think about heart rate variability uh like it's literally
    just like measuring the heart rate and then doing statistics on the time between
    beats um this is not sort of let's see heart rate variability um if you if anyone's
    ever seen like an EKG EKG which stands for echo cardiogram which starts with a
    C don't ask me why um it's the timing between these beats that we're sort of thinking
    of as the heartbeat and if anyone starts the there's a lot of other things you
    can say about the other types of shapes that are going on here which is literally
    below my level of analysis um but it's the variability between the the actual
    like LS and dubs of your heart um that we associate with heart rate variability
    um yeah there we go and so when we and we think about those numbers like there's
    a there's a inherent time scale there because we're talking about like the statistics
    of like a a timed thing and you can imagine that if you looked so at some point
    in all of our Lives we will be asked by our doctors to wear a heart rate monitor
    for like 48 hours straight and they will measure our heartbeat and they'll look
    at things about the statistics of those heart rates to sort of establish to look
    at various aspects of our nervous system and you can imagine that at like the
    24-hour time scale you're going to see an effects of the fact that you tend to
    sleep at night versus you tend to like walk around in the daytime so there's going
    to be a variability at that 24-hour scale where it tends to be

  text: faster for part of the day and then slower for another part of the day um
    but that's not the time and that's an interesting time scale but that's not the
    time scale that we're thinking about here um the time skill that we tend to associate
    with this conversation around the autonomic nervous system and these sort of trade-offs
    between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems happen on the scale
    of breaths um because one of the sort of sort of subtle aspects of the sympathetic
    parasympathetic nervous system is that they in a healthy happy sort of cheerfully
    functioning nervous system um the trade-off between the sympathetic and parasympathetic
    systems happen every time you take a breath and specifically I always forget which
    one which um when you inhale your sympathetic system starts to wake up and your
    heart rate increases in the inhale part of your breath and then when you exhale
    your parasympathetic takes over and your heart rate slows down at that part of
    your breath um it's very hard to feel that um and again it's that's at that layer
    when I try to sort of queue into my heart rate and tell if it's speeding up when
    I'm inhaling and slowing down when I'm exhaling it's it's right at that layer
    where my ability to be aware of it is around the same I think uh skill like the
    same power level as my ability to like lie to myself about my Sensations so I
    really have no idea if I'm actually feeling that if I'm just like expecting it
    so I am but I think that whatever that sort of personal sematic Journey might
    be um it's easier to do when my heart rate is elevated so if I'm exercising if
    my heart rate is beating fast in general I can often kind of like feel like when
    I inhale especially if I hold my breath you can feel your heart rate kind of speeding
    up and then when you exhale you kind of feel it kind of slowing down um and so
    that conversation on heart rate variability is something that happens um ideally
    at the scale of your breath and so when they're looking for things and typically
    when you hear people talk about things like heart rate variability they're they
    tend to be talking about it on that time scale and they're not talking about it
    on things like the 24-hour time scale or even like the multi hour time scale although
    if you dig into this even a little bit there's plenty that people have to say
    about heart rate variabil heart rate variability at those kinds of time scales
    um and so this is where we get to this sort of uh little bit of jargon which in
    my previous explorations of this area is this piece of jargon is is as far as
    I can tell the boundary layer between what I think of as like legitimate quote
    unquote legitimate science on this topic versus the woowoo science on this topic
    um is the boundary between neurovisceral integration and poly vagel Theory um
    so poly vagel theory if you see things

  text: talking about poly vagel you're probably in wo toown and that doesn't mean
    that it's not useful in any sort of on a personal level but typic I think that
    the term poly Bagel is when they start talking about like oh there's like a ventral
    path and a dorsal path and the vental does this and the dorsal does that and as
    far as I can tell there is no actual scientific uh backing for that anatomical
    distinction between like different parts of the Vegas nerve handling different
    parts of your regulatory system or whatever so if you see the term poly vagal
    or dorsal ventral or something like that not to say it's not useful but just know
    that you're you're you're off the standard scientific story when you get to that
    space neurovisceral integration model a neurovisceral theory um is the step back
    from that which just says that what we might consider to be like a healthy happy
    nicely functioning uh relationship between a given let's say mamalian nervous
    system in the World At Large can be measured and thought of as the ability of
    your nervous system to do a happy healthy and comfortable tradeoff between those
    different aspects of your autonomic nervous system in a sort of smooth and careful
    and sort of like regular manner so the ability of your body to transition from
    that sort of like arousal state that we associate with sympathetic and fight ORF
    flight and stuff like that and transitioning into the rest and relax and digest
    and those parts of things the ability to make those transitions smooth smoothly
    from one to the other um is what we tend to call neurovisceral Theory or even
    at a broader cut than that it's just this kind of this idea that your the neuron
    part like the like the the your your nervous system your neurons your central
    nervous system your brain your whatever um has a connection to your viscera like
    the the the the Lesser organs um and specifically your heart rate and your gut
    and your lungs and that those things are connected to each other and if you don't
    believe that um just know like you can think about something scary and your heart
    rate will go up so there is a connection between like the the most high futin
    abstrac inist parts of your cognitive neural system and the lowest level like
    we got to pump the goop through the body so that we can continue to like walk
    around and you know not die um and so those parts are connected and so thinking
    about so what I think of as neurovisceral and the way we've talked about the Linguistics
    of these stuff if you see two words which are squished together you can replace
    the o with a slash and that's kind of where you're at so neurovisceral is sort
    of neural visceral where again viscera is like the goopy the Lesser organs if
    you think about this in the way that don't think about the world like that but
    you can imagine what why one might um and so yeah and so with that I'm going to

    like this is where the trauma talk comes in um which I will try to do in a yeah
    we'll try to we'll try to sort of thread various lines there um so one of the
    main I would say again roughly on that time scale of like my entry into neuroscience
    and then sort of like it's becoming much more prevalent these days uh one of the
    ways that we have started to really think about um the nervous system and the
    role of your central nervous system and like why do you have a brain why do you
    have a a a a cordate um spinal cord like what's the what do those what's what
    role do those play in your actual ability to be a successful animal in the world
    um there is more and more of a belief that mostly what your nervous system is
    doing is predicting the future that's mostly what your cognitive and neural and
    central nervous systems are are for um your job as a as a organism as a creature
    as a human as a sort of cognitive agent is to predict the future on the basis
    on the basis of noisy out-of-date information about the current state of the world
    um combined with your memories and your histories and sort of like the lessons
    learned from previous um ask previous interactions and that's true on pretty much
    all time scales so with the sort of the classic like throwing a ball and catching
    it um when I you know I have the like so my senses are the slow are the fastest
    way that I get information from the world and arguably the only way that I get
    information from the world but even when I have a sensory experience it's always
    something that happened after CU afterwards weever learned SL remembered that
    um so your sensory information happens after the event in question occurred and
    then so using that information um which is noisy abstract out ofd I can sort of
    make some predictions based off my previous experience my sort of very wide and
    long array of previous experiences interacting with the world and I can say okay
    with the sensations that I felt on my hand coupled with the flashes of light I'm
    getting from my eyes um if I believe that if I send these series of motor commands
    to this arm it will hit the the world will occur in the way that I expected it
    to and the ball will land in my hand and you can see like when you if you ever
    look at like babies trying to get around and try to like interact with their world
    you could they're kind of like especially when they're very young they're kind
    of firing at random and they they sort of they they have this kind of like tripping

  text: nervous system works especially at that sort of Developmental layer is when
    we make a prediction where that works out like we expected it to like we wanted
    it to there is a um a reinforcement that occurs um we're want to talk about the
    goop again it's thought to be associated with like the dopaminergic system so
    if I oh I'm pretty sure if I if I do this with my body I'll get the outcome that
    I want and then the outcome that I want there's a dopaminergic release and your
    your literal dopaminergic is like the generation of dopamine so it like you squirt
    all these like chemicals into your nervous into the soup that basically had the
    effect of reinforcing whatever just happened was good let's reinforce that those
    like those neurons should should be connected in that way because it leads to
    results that I like in my life um and this gets into this concept that I'm going
    to describe here which is veence so veilance is just again root of value it's
    kind of like it's a thumbs up or a thumbs down um so good vean things are things
    that are generally good bad veilance things are things that are generally bad
    like if I reached out to this and it had like you know razor blades in it and
    I got cut I don't like that that's bad similarly if I fire 15 milliseconds too
    late and I miss the thing and I drop it um that's a negative valence and specifically
    it's useful to think about that because notice I'm not talking anything there
    about scale um like .1 is negative in the same way that 150,000 is negative and
    similarly 0.1 is positive negative a th000 is negative the veilance there is not
    a measure of the scale um and there's this so there's this relationship between
    when we make a prediction about the world and whether or not the prediction sort
    of works out in the way that we wanted it to as to what what the veilance of the
    of that outcome is defines whether our nerous system is like that was great let's
    do more of that let's you know dump some dopamine and reinforce those connections
    versus that was bad I didn't like that whatever just happened there was we made
    some bad predictions which means we made some mistakes there were some errors
    occurred in the calculation we need to correct for those things at some level
    um so yeah so there the out so there's this Central concept of prediction and
    then this other concept of like the outcome of those predictions defining sort
    of nervous system will try to organize itself um yeah and then know why I put
    that out of order but let's do that who cares um how we doing all time doing okay
    on time uh what I going to say yeah and I think I forgot to put this in so I'm
    not really sure what the what the order of operation should be here but um one

    like it was sort of it was already a little bit old hat by the time I started
    grad school and I have started seeing that same kind of thinking coming into the
    way that we tend to think of emotions and the way that our sort of the the that
    aspect of our nervous system and we tend I think naively or sort of like the general
    naive uh uh um relationship that we think of as emotions we think of them as if
    they were Sensations and as if they were reactions to the world and reactions
    to the way that the world is presenting itself to us and I think there's a very
    and there's obviously some aspect where that's going to be the case like a a alligator
    coming out of the water that's scary I am feeling fear um but there's also a predictive
    aspect of that emotion like I feel fear from that thing because I think that it
    will hurt me um I feel happy when I see cake cuz I think I'm going to eat cake
    um and so there's this interesting aspect of thinking of our our emotional responses
    to the world as being less about immediate reactions to the state of the world
    and more about a sort of a vague prediction about what this available information
    is going to mean down the line at some time scale possibly quick possibly slow
    and what I should do as a result of that with the alligator coming at me it's
    like I have to do alligator stuff very quickly uh whereas with the cake showing
    up it's like I have I need to do cake things at my own rate um and so you can
    kind of see how there's that like and typically speaking too like when we think
    about things like the emotional parts of our brain where emotions come from we're
    talking about things like amydala and those sort of like like subcortical regions
    which tend to live closer to the brain stem than they do to the cortex and often
    times emotions occur at the neurophysiological level in the form of like chemical
    dumps like there's a there's there some chemical gets released into the soup that
    we tend to associate with this that or the other emotion and a lot of like um
    anti-depressants and you know other forms of pharmaceuticals um operate by either
    stimulating the dump of that like you you just consume that chemical and so there's
    more of it floating around so your emotions are avoid or handled that way um or
    yeah you either eat synthetic forms or you sort of ask your body to dump those
    chemicals into your brain so like MDMA happens because by telling your brain dump
    all your happy juices um and so people tend to feel happy and then they also tend
    to feel like sad after the fact because of because you you you dumped all your
    happy juices and you have to wait to sort of get more um and and yeah and so and

    term disorder um in in the context of the concept of veilance um a disorder is
    cause is anytime things are in the way of your ability to live the life that you
    want to live and also in the kind of the wooi the the sort of you you'll see a
    lot of conversations in this topic which are more or less informed by like empirical
    research um and you also hear a lot in just like the general ways that we have
    started to talk about these things and are sort of casual environments and you
    sometimes hear people try to make a distinction between like capital T trauma
    with lowercase T trauma um where like lowercase tea is like I like I tried to
    drink the coffee and it was too hot and I burned my little lip whereas Capital
    tea is like I got into a car accident and now I'm afraid of cars um and and I
    think I you see people sort of I think reasonably like upset that some people
    might feel like they're like watering down these like important concepts by associating
    the same kind of conversation um to like the day-to-day like sometimes things
    don't work out like sorry them de beats versus like things like PTSD which can
    be very debilitating for people's lives um and I think that that's valid in some
    way um but also like like we've talked about nature is sort of goopy gradients
    and sort of Shades of Gray and where we choose to draw the line between what is

  text: just normal re relations to the world like sorry kid thems the braks get tough
    that's the world and that's like the healthy parts of stress that help you interact
    with the world you know in you know in in a in a productive and a way that's effective
    for yourself I think it's I'm less interested in trying to figure out exactly
    where to draw that line and more interested in help in trying toig make sure that
    people know how to draw that line in ways that are appropriate for themselves
    so I think that's why I want to think about the terms disorder as less of a thing
    that you're going to find in the DSM 5 saying or six maybe now like this is when
    it's disorder this is when it's just daily life and more in the terms of like
    it's a it's a thing that you kind of get to choose like is this something that
    is getting in the way of my ability to learn the life my live my life as I want
    to or is this just like you know learning important life lessons and having this
    the the acrel of experiences that we have eventually call things like wisdom and
    experience so up to you um and specifically I think that when we think of disorder
    it's it's often sort of like somehow the gears of the machine have slipped in
    some way and then the things that would normally operate as they would want to
    have there there's a thing something is stuck and so the the machine cannot operate
    in the way that it would normally operate um and that's what we think of you know
    names of disorders such as PTSD um where and I'm also going to make a distinction
    here between uh PTSD which is what we tend to think of as like you know something
    really bad happened and now I'm having a hard time interacting with the world
    so think like it it typically is like one really bad thing happened um think like
    a car accident um so like bad event and now have you had a very scary experience
    where you became you know you had a you know came close to you know Serious injury
    or maybe had a serious injury and now it's affecting your ability to interact
    with the world um I would call that acute trauma like one one big bad thing not
    cute acute um and this is in distinct distinction between a more I think subtle
    newer sort of way of thinking about PTSD which is we tend to call complex PTSD
    um which is the different type of behavior that we tend to associate with living
    in a world that is a general long-term explosure to a generally unsafe environment
    um so less one big car accident and more like you know living in sort of a you
    know maybe like lowgrade child abuse or like living in like food insecure environments
    where you grow up as a as a child and you can't always get food when you're hungry
    there's no one big thing that's bad enough to to like warrant like oh yeah and
    this was the event that I'm having to deal with it's more like living

  text: longterm with like a low grade harm that sort of pervades everything um I
    don't know if you can perhaps think of any people or groups of people who might
    experience the world that is generally speaking in a lowgrade way unsafe and filled
    with like small sub threshold traumas that sort of never quite cross the barrier
    of something you might be able to label specifically um but nonetheless become
    integrated into the way that you view the world um I can't think of any but maybe
    you can um and yeah and so just a real quick shout out to like some popside books
    that I have that sort of like the I would say the start of my own exploration
    of this this uh into the space the classic one is a book called the body keeps
    the score by James Vander Coke um which it doesn't really make that distinction
    between a and complex but it is about tends to be about acute uh acute PTSD written
    by James Gander Coke who was one of the people who wrote the uh the DSM definition
    of PTSD and got it sort of put into the common vernacular it gets a lot of flak
    these days I think for good reason because it's like I think the main complaint
    is like it is not written in a trauma-informed way it is it talks about like people's
    bad experience and like it's you know it's like it's hard to recommend it to people
    who've experienced bad effects because it's like it it has like sort of like let's
    talk about these let's talk about the things that people may have literally come
    to the book to be able to process in like a very graphic way so that's not really
    great um and it's it's not that bad it's just kind of like reasonable complaints
    um but it tends it also tends to be like very sort of like dry academic um it's
    the information it's very information dense which is good but um you know it's
    I still recommend it but I have I put these caveats on it also apparently Vander
    Coke is like a bit of a creep I think I don't know the details there but in the
    way that most older academics with some degree of notoriety become at some level
    um but you know still books are books um then the the one that I think of that
    I tend to recommend first to people is another one called um what my bones know
    by Stephanie Fu um which T which she is a person uh who grew up in like an abusive
    childhood environment and she became like a journalist so she wrote it's much
    more like me wari talking about her own sort of Journey to like understanding
    what cptsd is like and sort of like different treatments that she did and sort
    of like integrating into her own life so it's way less information dense but it's
    kind of like you know it feels a little more um modern and aware but it is very
    but but I don't think so the the Stephanie food book came later so she does talk
    about complex PTSD more specifically whereas the uh body keeps the score it just
    talks about PTSD and it doesn't really make that distinction between the two things

  text: um but yeah so the so in the context of the kind of stuff we've been talking
    about um if we think about the sort of the combination of the role of your nervous
    system primarily to be about predicting the future and integrating information
    and experiences to allow us to understand the the state of the world and the appropriate
    set of behaviors we should have in response to the state of the world um you can
    see where things like big traumatic events or even lowgrade long-term traumatic
    experiences can lead to kind of like a a slipping of the gears there and specifically
    in the ability of your body to to appropriately transfer between um the sort of
    the the figh ORF flight autonomic sort of the Fireflight sympathetic nervous system
    State and the more like resty relaxy um parasympathetic State and because basically
    your body is your your body your nervous system your central nervous system your
    peripheral nervous system your autonomic nervous system um is very sensitive to
    the outcome of the predictions that we make and we tend humans in general tend
    to be far more risk averse than we are reward celebratory um so like if you if
    you ask someone would you rather have $10 or a 10% chance of making $10000 rationally
    numerically those are the same offer but we massively prefer $10 rather than the
    possibility of $100 just because we tend to be more risk averse um one thing I
    like to say is like it would be a pretty shitty nervous shitty visual system that
    has that puts equal weight to everything in your visual field and notices the
    things that aren't tigers at the same level that it notices things that are tigers
    so we tend to be very risk averse and because of that we have we have the possibility
    or see like maybe the natural tendency to overweight bad experiences in helping
    us understand how we should interact with the world cuz if you have a situation
    where you know you are in a car accident or you sort of you're confronted with
    two doors one is blue one is green and you open the Green Door and you get punched
    in the face you open the blue door you get Cake and Candy um there is an after
    Thea kind of um speaking metaphorically and poetically after the fact you're your
    nervous system is going to do the the math of did we make a good prediction if
    we did we should reinforce it or did we make a bad prediction it it lead to us
    being harmed or or put into danger and if we did if we did have a situation where
    we we thought we were safe and then we we found a situation where we were we were
    harmed in some way your body is going to start looking for for things that you
    missed and things that you should have noticed before so that you can start thinking
    oh I should have noticed that

  text: that car was turning I should have noticed that the door was green and I and
    green means people are going to punch you when you open the door I don't know
    what that is um and so what can happen is what we tend to call hypervigilance
    uh where you're you you sort of Cu often times what ha because the world is cruel
    and capricious often times they're wasn't a thing that you could have noticed
    or at least not something that you really should have noticed given your experience
    um and so what will happen is your body will just like reach out for stuff and
    so sometimes like the lesson that your nervous system might learn was I let my
    guard down and that was the mistake and so and so what can lead to this kind of
    like disregulation of nervous system where your body might sort of associate being
    in a state of calm and relaxed especially if you're around other people especially
    if you're in like an environment that you know I don't know is in the world and
    so is sort of available for danger um and so you're it the the auto the the sympathetic
    nervous system might be unwilling to give up the re um at times when it needs
    to and that's where you can and it's thought that you could sort of measure that
    in the terms of heart rate variability where if you measure someone's heart rate
    and look for those transitions of highp speed versus low speed heart rate rate
    um on the scale of breasts you might not see that because the Paras the ner the
    sympathetic nerv system is holding on too tight and the parasympathetic system
    doesn't get the chance to do the slowing down that's supposed to happen and then
    you can imagine how that same type of in or i w say inability but difficulty in
    trading off between High State arousal versus like low low State um relaxation
    could lead to problems generally in health think about like that you know your
    gut's doing its job think about being able to sleep through the night and also
    think about being able to like interact with people around you and you know let
    your guard down around other people which is where a lot of the good parts of
    life tend to come from um and so that is the kind of that though that hypervigilance
    can be something that is sort of one of the consequences of traumatic experiences
    and specifically you know and then sort of like so the question then becomes from
    the perspective of people who care about humans having happy lives is like if
    that happens when that happens because unfortunately like the world is rough and
    we will encounter difficult difficulties um how do we sort of try to bring things
    back to Baseline um and what might work there and one thing that I also want to
    mention because I'm running out of time I think we're on a a good path but uh
    I wanted to sort of point out that um there's another concept which I'm not going
    to talk much about with which is the concept of resilience and the fact that not
    everybody that has a bad negative experience results in

  text: disordered autonomic regulation stuff um some people are able to bounce back
    and sort of what is it that defines or that can help us differentiate one versus
    the other and often times it's a question of Baseline a question of how much how
    many experiences have you had that show you that it is safe to be to relax and
    put your guard down and how many and how How likely have you are you to have experienced
    cases where that's not the case um and that's if you think about that in terms
    of your life and your development that is the reason why it is so important to
    try to protect children in to try to teach children that they can let their guard
    down and because if you think about the like the blue versus green door if you
    have a lifetime of experience with doors of all sorts of colors then and you open
    a green one and you get punched in the face you've opened enough green doors in
    your life that you know that it's not the door that's the problem and that was
    just you know I've opened a thousand green doors and only that one is the one
    that where I got hit but if I just started opening doors in my life and I've maybe
    never encountered doors of any color and I open a green door and I get hit in
    the face for the rest of my life like 100% of my at that point 100% of my experience
    tells me that green doors are unsafe and so you might develop a lifelong aversion
    to Green doors even when it's not appropriate and and I think one of the things
    that tends to come out of this literature and the this is discussed at length
    and the body keeps the score is really how critical it is for us to think about
    giving specifically young children the experience of safety and comfort in that
    early phase of their life and the and the the long-term consequences and effects
    that can come up not insurmountable they're not you know children of bad experiences
    are not doomed um but the early effects are going to be weighted more heavily
    than the later like early experiences are always going to be weighted more heavily
    than later experiences because in that early phase of your life you have less
    experiences to fall back on um and there's this kind of like mode of thinking
    that like we the world will always have the only way that we will ever like have
    a world we deserve optimistically is if we have three generations in a row where
    every child is get gets to experience stability and comfort and care for the first
    let's say 18 years of their life um three generations in a row which is because
    you know epigenetics and all that um and so yeah in the last couple minutes I
    want to talk just about yeah that the disordered hypervigilance response is this
    you can get into the space where like nothing is safe the world isn't safe I cannot
    let my guard down I cannot appropriately rest and relax um and in extreme cases
    that can be always

  text: and in the case of interpersonal trauma which unfortunately is a lot of it
    you can have that effect around other people and just like having a very difficult
    time being calm and being relaxed around other human beings um which is both the
    most appropriate response that you can imagine and also one of the things that
    is can be really um diminishing for your ability to sort of live a happy healthy
    productive not not productive let say effective productive is capitalism effective
    is internal motivation um and so again I'm I'm this is out of my field and I'm
    certainly not a a a therapist or a counselor or anything like that but a lot but
    I do find it very interesting that a lot of the treatments and therapies that
    we tend to associate with helping people get the gears back into into sync with
    each other has this um there's this there's this recurring pattern of tasks that
    cut across that full hierarchy of your nervous system and trying to engage your
    volitional Control Systems onto parts of your body on your nervous system that
    as close to that low level as it can get it you because you can't just decide
    to speed up your heart rate and slow down your heart rate but you can decide to
    hold your breath and take long breaths and take slow breaths so there's this concept
    of like the physiological sigh which I can't tell I think that's I think that's
    legit I I hav I don't know if that it's associated with Dan huberman who as far
    as I can tell is a legit scientist but I just I see him too often to trust him
    it's kind of like you you find your way in front of a camera too much for me to
    really trust you there but he does this research that kind of like it's you will
    see this in you'll feel this in your own life you'll see other people he just
    kind of like it's just that kind of like that like that feeling of like like an
    additional breath and then like a deep sigh and that is associated with some empirical
    basis with um like a reset like you're you're you know like typically it's like
    you're in like a an aroused like some height heightened State then you go and
    then it's kind of like your body kind of like releasing a lot of tension a lot
    of relaxing um you'll notice it in yourself and every time you do that like ask
    the question like why was I just why was I just cranked up what what was going
    on just now that was just going on and then now that I'm past that point what
    can I experience of that um this starts getting to the place of like the boundaries
    between like benevolent interaction between humans and like Maki aelian sort of
    like queuing into people if you're ever in an argument with somebody if you're
    ever in like like a difficult conversation with someone uh first of all try not
    to get too angry and upset and try to like Palm things down and take a pause and
    just just notice when they do that like because you'll be in the and then they
    like and then that's the point where you

    because they have hypothetically just left that high arousal State and sort of
    entered into a more resty relaxy kind of space um and you can game it you can
    cheat yourself cuz your nervous system your body your internal systems are brilliant
    and in the same way of most things that are brilliant they're also dumb as hell
    and so you can your body and your mind and your brain will lie to you it will
    trick you it will say things that are wrong but you can sling that straight back
    and Li lie lie just as hard because you can and so it's also thing like you can
    so like if you're trying to like get yourself to relax and we know that breathing
    in tends to ramp up the sympathetic and breathing out tends to ramp up the parasympathetic
    just take a quick and then like just breathe in quickly and then exhale slowly
    and that's just you're just gaming the system there um I also have a personal
    F fascination with the with eye movements in this conversation as well because
    sort of as we've talked about in many cases throughout this semester and and what
    I find to like a very similar way that our breathing is on that boundary of volitional
    versus autonomic control our eye movements are in a similar kind of space where
    you will make you know tens and hundreds hundreds of thousands of eye movements
    every day the vast vast vast majority of which are not volitionally controlled
    it's just your central nervous system grabbing visual information from the places
    that some lower reach of your nervous system wanted the information from and we
    can control that and at some level not all the time but we can engage through
    some effort uh we can grab that handle and sort of control things that way and
    there's treatments like EMDR which is ey movement desensitivity and reprogramming
    or something like that that involve um making patterned eye movements like back
    and forth as a way to kind of like take some control back over your central nervous
    system um and then also like naming and noticing the sort of like you'll see this
    in like sematic therapies where it's like naming the emotion and sort of like
    pointing to it in your body and sort of like the kind of like engaging like the
    linguistic parts of your brain which is like the most like highle abstract like
    non-biological parts that exist so putting a name on a Feeling is similarly like
    Reaching Across these like you know aons of the phylogenic tree and um a lot of
    the therapies just kind of have that that nature of sort of like reaching from
    the top down to the bottom and sort of like resting control that way and so in
    the last two minutes I sort of want to thinking about this uh in terms of having
    a body having a nervous system living in this sort of weird meat puppet that has
    all these

    of some of which you can control some of which you cannot and thinking about it
    in the context of like I've had you know dogs and cats and pets in my life and
    uh you know cats are kind of like having weird alien roommates that kind of like
    live and operate in the same space and like we like each other but we can't really
    communicate in the same way and I think that there's like parts of your nerv like
    your your your gut kind of feels like that like it's there it's it's it's you
    know you can operate in a certain way that gets certain Behavior but you can't
    directly control it in the same way that you can control your your muscular systems
    your eye movement systems dogs on the other hand is more like having an externalized
    aspect of your nervous system they actively Look to You to figure out how they
    should behave and you can control their behaviors in a much more direct way it's
    an independent being for sure but you can say calm down you can pet it you can
    if it barks it looks at you um and you can have that sort of a much more directed
    conversation with that externalized nervous system than you can with something
    like a cat and so I think that when we think about there's this concept of Neuroscience
    of the homunculus uh which is the the homunculus is the thing that you think that
    you are naively it's the feeling of like that you're like in a little driver seat
    in your brain and there's some externalized part of you that can look like look
    and examine the body that you're in and EXA some kind of control over it um but
    that doesn't exist there is not some additional smaller piece inside of you that
    internal small man in your brain small human in your brain that's just you that's
    just the system observing itself and that kind of of interaction is something
    that's kind of very um philosophically Frau and so in the last still have some
    number of seconds left uh victon Stein is a philosopher of language from like
    one of the progenitors of like our modern theories of like philosophy of science
    and he talked a lot about like the impossibility of language and the impossibility
    of like conveying human thought through language and the sort of sort of sad reality
    that you can never fully Express a human thought you can only approximate it over
    time he talked a lot about the like described as like having a beetle in a box
    and I have this box and I have this beetle in it and I can try to explain and
    describe what that is um what the beetle is like and it's got it's green it's
    got these little things on its head and I could talk about that for a thousand
    years but you'll never be able to actually see it you'll never get the same picture
    of the beetle as you could as if I could show it to you but I I can't and in the
    same but in the same way I realized now I'm out um that in the same way that nobody
    else can ever see the beetle that you have in your box you can never see the box

    of trying to know yourself and know your body it's a combination of being able
    to work to impossible task of describing your internal State and but also an aspect
    of like listening and hearing and sort of seeking help to actually get the full
    picture which you can never actually get from this first person perspective which
    is all we really have so yeah cuz if you're going to be doomed to push an impossible
