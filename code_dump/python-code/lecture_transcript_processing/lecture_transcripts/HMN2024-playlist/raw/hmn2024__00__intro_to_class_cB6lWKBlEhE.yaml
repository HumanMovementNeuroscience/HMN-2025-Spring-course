full_transcript: so I'm now starting recording and starting to talk so um let's see
  I gave myself notes so so this is a topics course which as I'm sure youall know
  is typically like topics courses are generally like they're off of the main schedule
  and there's some sort of other kind of topic that doesn't have like a proper class
  around it yet and often times those topics classes are taught to allow a professor
  of a research Professor like me to kind of like highlight their own research in
  a way that sort of doesn't fit within the standard sort of like curricula of um
  you know the university sort of the standard stem classes that you might typically
  take and uh this class so like I said I so I I am technically a professor of biology
  um even though I don't really do much biy ology because in this school um there
  isn't like a a dedicated Neuroscience Department there's the BNS um program sub
  major minor I can never remember what the status is on that but uh my research would
  kind of fit in a number of possible different departments um the most obvious ones
  being so biology because I study like you know the neural aspects of things and
  think about things such as neuron on um psychology would be I think a more an obvious
  fit because it's got the sensation and motor control kind of stuff um these days
  I do a tremendous amount of software development um in the sort of methods building
  and research sort of um research tool development side of life um which is a relatively
  recent development um I've also worked sort of close to robotics close to biomechanics
  close to physical therapy um and the specific specific little subdomain of research
  that me as an individual carves out it just doesn't really fit in any particular
  department so part of the main um structure of this course is to try to think about
  what what is the like what are the inroads to the to the specific thing that I study
  like uh which I will sort of talk about in a second um and the goal is to kind of
  give that sort of very broad survey of the various subtopics that sort of come together
  to make the specific domain that I study which is human movement in natural environments
  um but more so than that like my specific way of studying that because you can study
  a particular Topic in a bunch of different ways and I have come from such a weird
  and wild background that uh the sort of a interesting question of sort of how would
  you introduce someone to that field um not a field it's just sort of a thing I've
  learned how to do over the course of a couple decades um so there is something that
  I kind of it's something I have to say at the beginning of every class that I teach
  and I have never found a super great way to say it um but I don't I would not feel
  comfortable teaching a class to a room full of undergraduate people without acknowledging
  the moral elephant in the room um which is that none of this is okay none of the
  general structure of Academia education is morally defensible at almost any level
  uh the amount to which you are being exploited financially to be in this room is
  absolutely indefensible and unconscionable um and there is truly nothing that I
  could ever do on this side of the podium that would ever be worth the financial
  burden that's being put on you by being here um you can do the math if you want
  uh to calculate the number of people times the annual tuition room and board the
  number would come out to be something like $2 to3 million if you wanted to be more
  conservative and only count credit hours it would be somewhere around a quar million
  dollars it's indefensible Absol absolutely not okay and I have over the course of
  my four to 5 years let lose track um time as being as Professor here I have uh sort
  of had to find a lot of different ways of trying to handle the um the the term is
  moral harm uh which is the term that refers to the specific kind of sort of psychological
  trauma that occurs when you are forced to participate in an institution or a system
  that is morally repugnant to you in some way um I'm here for a lot of the reasons
  that you are here which is because I love learning I love teaching I love sort of
  the scientific exploration and the nature of society as it is is that the to do
  that at the highest level you sort of have to come to for legal reasons I will say
  institutions like this one um in order to participate in that and it's some it's
  the kind of thing that I didn't fully comprehend um what that all meant until I
  became a professor uh it's the kind of thing where like you're all students and
  you experience life as a student does which is basically as a a temporary person
  in an institution like this when you have a set amount of time that you'll be here
  that you'll go through you'll have the degree um and then you'll leave and then
  and so everything up to and up to the point of becoming a professor type person
  has that kind of characteristic you're an undergraduate then you're a graduate student
  then you're a postdoc and then if you sort of out compete your peers which is an
  insane concept why are you trying to out compete your peers you should work with
  your peers to anyways we'll get on to that um but all up until that point you have
  there is this sort of temporary nature to it and I think in retrospect there felt
  like it was a kind of um it felt more there's like a you're you're strugg I felt
  like I was struggling against the system to try to SU in that context and then I
  happened to become a professor in the summer of 2019 uh so I had about a year of
  like boy I sure did make it and this is probably fine and then summer of 2020 roll
  around covid happened and with all of the various ways that that affected the World
  At Large and me in particular um I basically just lost all faith in the academic
  and scientific systems in that summer and and uh sort of had a whole crisis of conscience
  um and tried to was trying to find ways of basically restructuring my life and my
  effort and sort of you know I've got I had 35 and change years at that point of
  not 35 directly but like close to 20 years of e of effort at that point to make
  it to this point this is a position of nonzero Social Power um and there is kind
  of this general idea of like don't give up if you can use it to the benefit of you
  know your own moral beliefs or whatever um and it was it was a hard and challenging
  thing to think about uh and just to like try to sort of come you know you what often
  times happens when you work within institutions which we are all forced to do is
  there's a conflation between the values that you hold um and the institutions that
  are sort of the vehicles for those values and when you lose faith in an institution
  which I highly recommend just never trust institutions trust people don't trust
  institutions um there was a whole thing of like trying to figure out like what I
  was actually here for what what my actual goals and morals and values actually are
  and a lot of things come out of that probably uh stuff that I still should not say
  on camera um but the general idea was a a shift of Focus From the doing the traditional
  um modes of research in education which was which pretty much to this day still
  involves uh do research for Publications apply for Grants produce students that
  will uh try to climb the same ladder you are on understanding entirely that that's
  to get 10 you're you're supposed to produce like you know more than two of people
  who are also trying to get 10 years at other school which is sort of the definition
  of a Ponzi scheme um and that was sort of the effort it's often times you you're
  when you're working in these types of systems that we tend to live in which are
  competition-based hierarchies predicated on assumptions of false scarcity uh the
  the game that you play is sort of you you're asked to compete with the people who
  are sort of at your same level in the hierarchy in order to please the people who
  were above you in the hierarchy most of whom have been in that position for longer
  sort of a gerent tocy type of thing and I realized that a lot of the effort that
  I was putting in like a a very big percentage of the effort I was I was putting
  into the world was made in the service of the people who were above me on the hierarchy
  and to do trying to do the things that they wanted me to do so that I could outperform
  my peers and be allowed to stay in you know the warm happy Shing Tower at the top
  of the hill that we are all currently in um and so one of the big changes that I
  uh sort of M brain shifts that happened was deciding to just stop doing that and
  to just stop caring or considering what I was being asked to do by people above
  me in the hierarchy and start asking instead what I could do to support people who
  were at or below me in that same hierarchy which is largely yall types um from a
  practical perspective what that turned out to be was a so in that time of sort of
  doing you know living doing research I sort of like I've got all these papers we'll
  talk about them um and with that sort of crisis of conscience uh there was this
  question of like well I don't so universities are probably evil um journals are
  definitely evil uh so but I do love the research I do love the teaching so what
  what do you do if if you don't want to you know do the dumb work of publishing a
  bunch of papers to try to make the powers that be happy um to you know please the
  gatekeeping dinosaurs above you um what do you do with your time um and it was around
  that time sort of through other modes I mean that was I had basically I I have a
  big fancy lab uh at Richard 453 which will be y'all will be touring with Aaron not
  next week CU I'll be out of town um and when Co hit I I had I so I showed up I had
  all these plans for like the research that I was going to do in the big fancy lab
  and you know they were doing the construction and the construction wrapped up around
  January uh and I was sort of gearing up to start the the research cycle and then
  quarantine hit got sort of sent home and had to sort of for a while just kind of
  flailed around trying to figure fig out like what am I going to do with my time
  what are we going to do with our time and uh at that time I wound up um basically
  there were a couple things happening in in in my lab at that point most of which
  were related to the to work in like the big fancy map lab um and then there was
  one little side project that involved uh this computer vision based method for doing
  motion capture with like Cheo webcam in free software um and so when Co hit I basically
  we shifted effort towards working entirely on that because that was a project that
  we could work on sort of remotely with ease and sort of you know kind of figure
  that out and so as so that was like March or whatever and then as we sort of got
  into the summer and that project started to sort of like take up pick up some steam
  um and I started losing faith in the system and all that kind of stuff I I found
  myself kind of of uh coming across softwares such as uh blender which we're going
  to talk about blender blender is a free open source Mark uh sorry uh got that sort
  of stuck my head it's a big free open source um 3D animation software it's been
  around for some decades it's a large scale wides scale thing and it has been it
  is 100% free 100% open source and built over the course of decades by thousands
  of people across the world and given away freely as a gift freely given for anyone
  to use and benefit from and I kind of had this moment of realization that that was
  actually the thing that I wanted to be doing um the open source Community is what
  the scientific Community pretends to be like we pretend as scientists that we are
  doing that that we're working in this big sort of global collaborative Endeavor
  but it's not but practically speaking you're just not really able to do it so most
  of the research that gets done really shouldn't be done it's not good research it's
  just smart research it's strategically the right move to get the publication to
  get the grants to get the job to get the tenure um and it never and it often will
  serve like I'm not saying that all scientists are idiots and that all research is
  garbage um although the percentage is higher than you wish it was um but the nature
  of the institutions that sort of house it and the realities of like the hyper competitive
  structures of society that we' sort of grown for ourselves are that you're not really
  able to do it in a way that really benefits anybody outside of the club and when
  you see scientists sort of traditional scientists doing like Outreach it's often
  this kind of just like side thought like I'm going to go to a high school show them
  how cool it is to be super highly educated and then just leave and then hope that
  they're inspired enough to follow in your path out compete their peers and then
  maybe they someday can get into that shining Tower at the top of the hill um it
  just didn't seem right to me so uh long story short such as it is um all of that
  kind of culminated into a sort of or not culminated but sort of over the long course
  of time uh that became basically did I break it this guy this is computer there
  you go so this is Freo cap.org so this is a software that I've been working on with
  Aaron for about five years uh it's called freeo CAP it's a free open source marketless
  motion capture system and it's basically been the thing that has soaked up the energy
  that would have been spent publishing papers and trying to make people happy um
  I instead spent um building this tool to do full body motion capture with Cheapo
  garbage webcams in free software and it's been going quite well uh and we're going
  to talk plenty more about that um it's on GitHub free moap there there's a Discord
  server with looks like pushing 2500 members in it got about I think last I checked
  approaching 5,00 ,000 unique users in like 115 countries which is all quite good
  and the focus of the project and the software is to instead of taking my particular
  skill set and expertise which I have sort of accumulated over the course of decades
  Now using mostly taxpayer funding to pay my salaries and my paychecks um and rather
  than trying to use that to just publish super esoteric papers that will only be
  beneficial to other super esoteric people um the goal was to try to package that
  same use that expertise to build a tool that sort of meets a general need of society
  at large and then sort of try to serup building that tool as both the thing that
  the world wants also the tool that I want to do my research um and ideally trying
  to use that as a as a mechanism for Building Bridges and sort of pulling people
  in so a lot of the like I would say at this point still the majority of users of
  this software are animators um often young 3D animation artists uh video game designers
  things like that um and also a bunch of you know students and grad students and
  you know biomechanics clinical whatever this that and the other um lot of dancers
  and musicians and things like that and they are using this software for their own
  purposes that's sort of part of it is like I don't want to I don't want to tell
  you what you should care about I'd rather just give you useful tools and let you
  do what you want to do with it um but because I with help um Global Wei uh designed
  this thing based off from my perspective I am also trying to sort of surreptitiously
  uh make this as a tool that is also kind of an educational platform in its own right
  something that will it doesn't teach you directly it's not giving you like lessons
  and quizzes but the nature of the tool is to um try to teach you how it works and
  to try to kind of basically the the idea is to give you kind of a greased rail into
  the the densest part of the forest um and then shine enough lights that you can
  sort of navigate yourself around there a lot of the education the general structure
  of Education that um yall tend to receive is sort of this like let's start with
  the basics let's start with the the simple boring stuff that frankly is not particularly
  motivating on its own because trust me trust me it's going to lead somewhere so
  cool and if you can only hang on and out compete your peers uh for long enough then
  you'll be able to see all the cool fun stuff um and there is actually a a reaction
  that I I've had more than once uh when I talked about the software to people where
  which is you should be careful not to make it too easy to use otherwise the students
  won't understand what's going on in there and it's like like insane to me to think
  that because I would much because the reality is that in in the natural world in
  the real world um your first reaction upon encountering something is often going
  to be confusion like when you first come across some like strange artifact that's
  the that's the least you were ever going to understand it and you will wind up if
  you're lucky uh slowly kind of back in your way into a level of understanding um
  and so rather than trying to uh basically hold your hands on a very specific path
  with this with an intended outcome of the thing that I'm trying to show you I am
  instead going to be trying to um show you a broad landscape that you are frankly
  that is frankly going to be pretty over your head for the most part and then allow
  you and give you the tools that you need to kind of Na gravitate towards the parts
  of that landscape that are the most motivating to you as individuals um and then
  allow you to kind like give you the tools that you need to kind of like back your
  way into a place of understanding and basically working your way from like the advanced
  stuff in the center of the Woods back to the beginers ship that we really should
  have started with um so that you can basically ground yourself from the that position
  but the reality is that because it's such a broad landscape um you're all going
  to sort of find different parts of it and you're going to need different parts of
  that beginner basic stuff and we'll kind of sort of gravitate in that direction
  um so little bit of yeah let me see where I'm at with this there's more it gets
  this is still context um right so that's so that's that's the general gist of the
  life that I live and there's a little bit of I mean the class is obviously overlapping
  with that General thing because I'm the one standing up here and your guys are over
  there um specifically within this class there is another there's another player
  um which is that I the story I was telling you about uh sort of like the loss of
  faith and the finding of the free open source thing and sort of the reshaping around
  this software and educational blah blah blah um all of that is basically you know
  started in roughly summer of 2020 and it's kind of been progressing since there
  I've taught a couple of classes sort of win that Vibe I see a couple of uh what's
  the word uh familiar faces is possibly from inquires in some cases has anyone been
  in a class with me before no who are you people um uh well yeah so and I've worked
  on trying to like teaching this type of stuff and trying this like broad landscape
  thing um and trying to incorporate as much of these sort of like beep Tech tools
  um as I could uh and then I guess it was what was it like two years ago now April
  two year and a half ago uh there was a there was a certain uh technological event
  which occurred and you heard about it um and the the hype cycle has sort of come
  and gone to the point where you're probably annoyed about it at this point but the
  thing in question is artificial intelligence um my background uh my first degree
  is in philosophy I got a a degree in philosophy focus on on philosophy of mind and
  philosophy of science there's going to be a lot of that specifically the philosophy
  of science in this course um and from there I got a PhD in cognitive science which
  is effectively AI studies these days and my particular domain within cognitive science
  which is another one of this like mish mash like sort of comedically broad Fields
  was on the like the biological side like psychology Neuroscience kinds of stuff
  um but I also did a lot of work with robotics I did a lot of sort of I learned a
  lot about AI machine learning and sort of theories of language and all that stuff
  um and when GPT 3.5 came out like I've been following the various language models
  since you know roughly 2008 um and when 3.5 came out I saw and I was like oh wow
  this is this is getting really good this is really a very they've really been working
  over there um and then when GPT 4 came out it was just like okay there is now a
  shift has occurred and it is now important to take note of it um so I contacted
  my remember remember very clearly I I was uh you know I can't remember exactly the
  the timing of it but at some point I have I have a friend named John linstead uh
  who will probably come up later who's a friend from graduate school and he was much
  more on that AI side of things he was a director of the cognitive science program
  at Sunni as Wego for a while and I sort of we we got on to the Discord chat or whatever
  and he says John we need to discuss the situation uh and we both immediately knew
  that the situation was that AI exists and it is not it's not it's not like you don't
  have to worry about it as like coming to life and like biting you that's not a thing
  um and pretty much any like anything you're going to see from almost any source
  is going to be missing the point to some degree or another one of the nice things
  about being an expert is I just Bally look like oh yeah y' all have it wrong um
  but and it's not endgame and there you know there's still a lot to happen but the
  reality but it is a major shift in technology that 100% is going to reshape our
  society in a lot of predictable and unpredict ways over the course of the next 5
  to 10 to 20 years um and not necessarily for the better uh it is as most Technologies
  it is come from the techn capitalist corpo hamani that is the source of so much
  of the sort of problems and harm in our society and in much the same way that they
  have sort of you know I'd say cause significant damage to our social infrastructure
  over the past 20 some odd years um they are going to attempt to continue to do that
  and they're going to attempt to use the anytime there's a new technology that comes
  around um the techn capitalist of just the capital the Corporal capitalist basically
  try to rush to the new domain and start building Moes around it so that they can
  sequester it and then use their access to that thing as a way to exploit The World
  At Large that is the true core of capitalism is to exploit disparities between yourself
  and others to extract resources from them um and so a lot of and I think at this
  point um a lot of that's probably become somewhat apparent and there's probably
  uh at least a percentage of you who are sort of like feel like aii um because it
  is so overwhelmingly tied to the corpo techn capitalist infrastructure um but there
  another angle to that and I think that it can be very difficult to uh recognize
  the it's very difficult I think especially when you're coming at something from
  from like a non-expert position to discern a separation between the core technology
  that exists and the sort of implementation of that technology like it's hard for
  us to see things like gp4 on open AI as anything other than just like another arm
  of Microsoft it's hard to see whatever the hell it is that you know Google is trying
  to do is anything other than just like another way to steal your data and another
  way to shape the world around sucking $20 a month out of you for sort of a bunch
  of basic functionalities that you are going to eventually like require for your
  daily life um but I think that it's really important to but I I I I think that this
  particular technology is different because unlike a lot of other tools and other
  like so things like computers uh and phones and things like that like these are
  also World shaping Technologies and they did shape the world and you were sort of
  a part of it and I think a lot of yall are the both um beneficiary and harmed individuals
  from what happened over the C of the past 20 years when the entire world basic shifted
  towards everything that we do in our daily lives is going to be pushed and pulled
  through apps that are made by corporations that do not have your best interest at
  heart um and be and there was sort of an inherent that disparity between the ability
  to make these applications to build these types of Technologies um was one that
  was pretty easy to exploit because you know I can't make this I can't make a chip
  I can't I mean I guess I can build an app but it's not going to be the same thing
  as you would get from a Google or a Facebook um and so they get to use that and
  they get to use the fact that this is now an essential technology um you know we
  find these Technologies and we sort of reshape our our society to them um and there's
  sort of this limitation there um AI I think is different because it is fundamentally
  it's like they're trying to build Moes around the moat blaster 99000 like it is
  a tool that will teach you how it works and it will show you everything there is
  to know about itself and they're trying to to Corral it and control it in sort of
  in the same way that they used that they sort of that you sort of that they were
  used to and it's kind of just not working in the way that they would expect um we'll
  talk about that in in detail um I don't want to go too deep down this rabbit hole
  because that is definitely something I like to do um but I'm mostly kind of saying
  that just to sort of comment on uh the tech ick that I think is a fair uh response
  to this to the world that we live in um because I do think that sort of AI used
  properly is something that has the ability to be a a transformatively liberative
  uh tool um and one that has the potential to make every single human person that
  learns how to use it and learns how to wield it a more powerful and capable version
  of yourself um it's not a it's not an oracle that will solve all of your problems
  it is which is how it's often trying to be pushed on you um it's not a it's not
  something that's automatically going to make the world better um but it is an unbelievably
  powerful tool that if you learn how to use it what I whatever it is that you are
  trying to do in your life if it involves the generation uh ex sort of understanding
  manipulation of text on a screen AI can help with that um it's not automatically
  it won't build all your life for you but it is a unbelievably powerful tool with
  a very shallow initial learning curve and as far as I can tell an un unlimited maximum
  possibility so um that will lead us Discord don't do that so I live a lot of my
  life on Discord um wish I didn't I kind of I appreciate the software for what it
  is but I also kind of hate it for what it is um and when pt4 came online uh would
  have been like I guess spring of 2023 or something like that um one of the first
  things I did is I built a a a a bot out of it and started using it to teach a class
  um and that I taught it was a summer class and then I taught another version of
  this class last fall and then I taught a class uh in the Capstone in the spring
  didn't go so well um and then now this is is the fourth iteration of using a AI
  Discord AI empowered Discord bot um as a way to try to teach and provide yall types
  with a the ability to sort of explore a topic that is sort of Broad and vast and
  uh complex um so we're going to talk about details of that sort of adnasium at some
  point um but the basic idea is that that this so there here's this server which
  is sort of structured roughly around the topic of the class um and here is this
  bot named Skelly bot that lives in the server um Skelly so the this is Skelly it's
  like the logo of mascot of free mocap and so free mocap the software has a bunch
  of little small parts and they're all named like Skelly something so like the camera
  part is called Skelly cam the bot part is called Skelly bot uh if you're curious
  about it you can click on Skelly bot and then this GitHub link here will take you
  to the source code for it and I think the most important part of this is this phrase
  right here this bot help me build this bot um I could not have made this thing without
  this thing uh it like the the the skills and sort of like technical aspects of building
  a thing like this like I didn't I wasn't trained in computer science like I managed
  to like hack and slash my way through grad school and sort of like building the
  in order to like and I was able to build the the basics of the premot cap software
  because that is my domain of expertise this is not um I have I mean I have like
  an understanding theoretical understanding of AI but building a tool like this was
  beyond me but the thing about these AI is you just say hey could you help me with
  this thing and it's like yeah absolutely no problem 100% and it will give you an
  answer which is mostly right often not not always but often and if you learn how
  to navigate that and use that and sort of like uh surf the various ways that it
  is right and wrong and like learn the kind of things that it like like oh this is
  the problem that AI is going to it's not going to be able to do that oh it's absolutely
  going to be able to do that um if you can learn how to navigate that space and use
  these tools it will power level you through spaces that you could have have can
  slash your way through over time that you could have sat down with a real human
  primate expert who would explain it to you piece by piece um or you can just learn
  how to ask the machine and the Machine will sort of help you do these things um
  how exactly that happens is complex there's not like a quick answer it's like most
  complex tools it's the learning process is a little bit of instruction with a lot
  of just like try it and see how it goes um and part of the structure of this course
  is to sort of give you the opportunities to do that within the landscape of the
  neural control of real world human movement um so and so specifically now coming
  to like AI within an educational context um if you so when I up here as like you
  know career research scientist with some Decades of experience in this very sort
  of rather niched out field um like I'm not so like a lot of a lot of times if you're
  like like a a standard specialist you're like in the niche of a niche of a niche
  of a niche of a field so you're sort of like a very very specific person um my particular
  version of that is I'm within I'm like a niche of a niche of a niche of a niche
  so it's sort of like not that deep down but it's like it's sort of a a breath versus
  depth kind of thing um which can be harder to do not hard necessarily harder to
  do it takes a same amount of time but it can be harder to teach um because I can't
  assume that you all have gone through like if I if I was like an advanced you know
  epigenetics of Immunology F expert I can say okay have y all done like you know
  intro bio cell bio like you know whatever da da da da D all the expertises that
  you would need to get to this sort of level of spe specificity and depths um with
  this kind of very broad area like it's I can't assume that it's possible that some
  of you have some of the prere but none of you are going to have all of them because
  I've I've checked and pretty much one of the like there are roughly one person in
  the world that has all of my same background because I just I bounce around so much
  that the specificity that you get to is just kind of you become a uniqueness when
  you start overlapping enough skill sets uh pretty quickly uh which is just also
  just generally good career advice it is way easier to be unique by just combining
  a bunch of different things um and then eventually you sort of see that all the
  when you overlap enough vend diagrams and you look at sort of who is shared amongst
  all those V diagrams it's like oh wait this is actually just me um which is way
  sort of easier and more fun to do than to try to sort of out compete everybody that
  sort of is in the same sort of space and domain um but you know all your heart oh
  yall all found your way in good job um so uh the general Vibe of AI within this
  class um will be that this uh so who here has used GPT at all like prompted little
  bit talk to it you say hi it says hi back you ask it a question it says something
  back um the low the base level um introduction there is prompting AI large language
  models in particular are at their core language calculators um in the same way that
  you would sort of punch a bunch of numbers into a calculator push go and it gives
  you another number L language models do roughly the same thing you you push a bunch
  of words into their context window push go and it looks at its unbelievable sort
  of uh data set and provides a statistically most likely answer um that is the the
  the expected and desired outcome of the input to the output um yeah so and I'm going
  to say this even though this this is a little bit off off of that topic but um the
  main thing that happened I think the main like there was like an empirical event
  that happened like an interesting empirical event uh that happened arguably with
  something like dpt4 um versus like the earlier incarnations of it which was when
  I was in When I Was An undergraduate in studying philosophy of language there was
  sort of this this question of does language require uh some sort of like native
  like like native genetic uh like neurophysiological um architecture to be able to
  happen like is there something special about like the the human evolutionary lineage
  that allows us to do language or the question was is it possible that you could
  just sort of extract language from a large enough data set in some clever statistics
  and when I was in undergrad at like what was that 2006 or so it was kind of like
  it's hard to say who knows and I remember at the time there was like you know like
  undergraduate right so there were like there were some people there who had been
  like the professor was sort of more attuned to like the the you know what was going
  on in the field it's like yeah those like the the statistical people are are making
  some interesting progress in that space but they're still not doing anything that
  resembles proper language and what happened for me as from my sort of perspective
  with GPT 4 was that that question was answered very definitively and the answer
  was yes um it is in fact possible to extract language from a large enough data set
  and some clever statistics without ever giving it explicit rules of grammar or explicit
  concepts of words and anything like that um and I consider that to be an empirical
  Discovery and the sort of from a psychological like a Psy test experiment it's sort
  of like how do you know that that happened it's like well I'm a human and I talk
  to it and I'm like oh yeah that's interesting like I I have a conversation with
  the machine and it's like you were definitely the machine is definitely doing language
  and that language is derived truly purely from the statistics of the data set which
  in this case represents like every Stitch of text that was written on the internet
  since 1985 um and some clever statistics which is basically in this case uh Transformer
  models which you know just uh you can search for that if you're interested in it
  um so yeah and so that's a bit of an aside but I think I think that that is the
  thing that um that was the situation that my friend John wared to talk about is
  like oh we just uh the world may not really may not realize it like it's this is
  not how I do not hear this being discussed in this way in in sort of the highest
  in in channels um but the question to the answer to that question has been empirically
  discovered and you yeah you actually can extract language from statistics and and
  we also now have and so another thing that happened is we now have a secondary example
  for the first time in history a secondary example of a thing that can carry out
  a conversation uh it's not a good conversation in many cases it's certainly not
  a human it's not really it's it's definitely not conscious it's but it it's a cognitive
  agent it does language math in its head and and before and you know you hear people
  saying like oh it's not really doing language because it's just like using it statistic
  to like to predict the best output and it's like y' I got some real bad news for
  you about what you're doing when you're doing language um so anyway that's yeah
  anyways that's part of the um the landscape of what's going on here um and so there
  is also a part of again like the the the ethical obligations that I feel like I
  have as the person standing on you know the chairs are facing this way uh which
  is that there is this new technology it has emerged onto the landscape I don't really
  see it being understood or utilized uh in at large so I and I am sort of like fairly
  uniquely suited to teach it use it that type of thing and so I think that this is
  one of the most useful things I can do for you is introduce you to this technology
  this tool show you how it works and teach you sort of how you can utilize it in
  your own cases even if you wind up not using it in the future it will affect your
  life um from the outside so and it like this technology like all Technologies they
  can and will be used against you so you should understand it to the extent that
  you can utilize it to the extent that it helps you become a more effective version
  of yourself and my job and hope is to allow you and help you do that so uh right
  so um so in the specific way that I want to but I I I have used it and will continue
  to use it is to prompt the bot uh the term is prompting um to basically try to get
  the bot to act like effectively like a simulation of myself and a simulation of
  my expertise obviously the very best education that y'all could get from this class
  is if I sat down with each each one of you individually asked you what your interests
  were helped you work through things answered your questions gave you some answers
  and uh did that individually for you on call 247 every every answer um but I unfortunately
  am a limited piece of meat and that is not within my capacity um so instead I can
  make this bot which is absolutely not as good as having a sit down conversation
  with me but it's not bad and it will allow you to basically there's this question
  of like um how good are these things like you and I'm sure you get all sorts of
  sort of uh like the responses that I've seen to AI from a lot of the educational
  landscape is very defensive and it's sort of like don't use it for teaching don't
  use it for uh don't use it for your like don't use it for it's it's it's don't cheat
  don't basically don't cheat don't don't whatever write your papers blah blah blah
  it's not uh in this like it gets it wrong it's got these hallucinations blah blah
  blah like all these things sort of like try to get you not to use it um uh and it's
  true that it will get most things it it gets things wrong at some level and it has
  absolutely no idea when it's when it's saying something wrong there's this thing
  called the grounding problem uh which is just a in philosophy of AI is just sort
  like a thing um it will tell you the exactly right answer in the exactly wrong answer
  with the exact same level of confidence in itself um and so there is a certain L
  like you that's one of the things you have to learn is when to recognize like when
  it's getting things right and wrong um however uh there is another aspect of it
  which is that its ability to be right about things like it's is is pretty much entirely
  contingent on its data set uh if the question that you're asking is present in the
  data set it will tend to get it right it's kind of like a Google search like you
  can search for pages that exist if you search for something that doesn't exist well
  these days it will'll just get you a bunch of garbage that's close by and I guess
  I guess a good analogy would be imagining searching for something that doesn't exist
  and instead of showing you a bunch of stuff that's not thing you want the answer
  was I'm just going to take the top three things that you don't want and then tell
  you that this is the answer to your question so it will it's not gaslighting you
  because it truly believes the things that it said um but it is a it is an aspect
  of the thing that it doesn't it does not know whether it's right or wrong um however
  the because the nature of this class is a lot of it's like basically like level
  expertise in a bunch of different domains most of the questions that y'all will
  have about these fields and subfields are things that exist in textbooks if it's
  a qu if the answer to the question is exists in a textbook somewhere it tends to
  nail it um and this is I'm saying this on the basis of having like taught classes
  with this um it if you ask simple questions about like you know what's the ocular
  motor system like what's the cerebellum up to what's Superior calculus like how
  does a muscle work like what's the evolution like what's up with the elbow what's
  that deal what's a motor unit what's a Gogi tendon organ um it Nails all those questions
  because those are all not they if the question has been asked and answered at least
  10,000 times since 1985 on the internet it will tend to get it right um and so the
  interesting space that you are now in so when so for me because I've I've been alive
  for long enough to have EXP uh y'all y'all don't not because you're dumb just because
  you it it takes longer than that to develop expertise like I have um I've been I've
  been studying what I study for as long as many of y'all have been alive um and I'm
  still like you know I'm starting to get to the point where it's like oh I most of
  what I know now is like I have a good enough sense of the landscape that I I know
  the difference between the things that I know the things that we know as a species
  and the things that we don't quite know as a species so I am I'm in a very good
  position to be able to talk to the bot and sort of to push it into area that I know
  like the the the really fiddly answers to it and I get to see it kind of go wrong
  and go off the rails and sort of like start making stuff up and start guessing and
  making frankly the kinds of guesses that I see like non-experts make like when you
  if you're I don't want to like talk down about non-research professors um but like
  a teaching Professor who is not in like the the specific domain of research that
  that you're talking about is like or not even teaching professors textbooks textbooks
  are mostly wrong that's kind of one of the the secrets of if if it has been around
  for long enough to be written down in a textbook it's probably wrong at some level
  it's at the very least a cartoonized version of the real thing which is always going
  to be more complex than not there it's always going to be less stable than you are
  often led to believe um one of the many bad uh yeah one of the many themes of this
  class will be acting under uncertainty and one of the recurrent themes there is
  that we know a lot we know a lot more and a lot less than you're often tend to taught
  I think that the nature of undergraduate education like there's tests there's quizzes
  there's papers there's grades um there's this sort of like certification system
  that we go through it's like yes you understand organic chemistry a chunk um and
  the nature of that is that things are often presented to you as if they are right
  or wrong true or false like what's the answer to this question oh it's B that's
  not really how the world works like there like questions can be like we'll get into
  the philosophy of science aspect of that later but um the world's a lot murkier
  than we would like for it to be and that is true of science it's true of every field
  um and I lost my point but uh yeah anyways so the idea will be that within this
  space and that the structure of this class is going to be encouraging you to um
  navigate this area and then rather and what AI will allow us to do uh versus an
  earlier era of life um is it will allow each of you to to navigate a much more uniquely
  s uh spe like you'll basically all be able to choose your own trajectory through
  this space um because the thing to be cons like if I'm up here giving a lecture
  about you know biomechanics or neuromechanics or something like that I I have to
  kind of think about like are they going to be able to follow any of this is this
  any of this going to going to land and like if I can't so I have to like limit the
  density of the things I say to try to make sure that like at least a percentage
  of you can sort of follow the plot um but what is this is it25 is the class over
  yeah um but one thing I get to do with AI and I'm going to give it a shot at the
  I think we'll have we should have time but um we actually start talking about the
  content of the class uh but one of the things that I that this allows me to do is
  to be much much much denser in the information that I present to you um because
  because I can I will I'm going to talk about things that are going to be over your
  head uh and it's going to come real fast and you're not going to follow all of it
  I can guarantee you already um but that's going to be okay because I'm going to
  record it and then once I record it I'm going to scrape the audio put it into the
  AI as like an outline of topics put that in one of the channels and then one of
  the assignments will be go ask the bot about whichever as like which which part
  of this was the most interesting to you which part of this was the most confusing
  to you which part of this do you wish I had said more about which part of this did
  I say something about but you didn't follow it at all um and so my goal will be
  to say all the things that need to be said um to say in a way that you that you
  know that you can follow because you're all smart people um and your job is going
  to be to basically uh stand in front of the fire hose and try not to let your brain
  turn off entirely and try to just let it wash over you and to notice when you have
  something that sort of like wakes up like when I mention some this or that or some
  topic over here or some topic over there uh to notice what those things are and
  then in your own time and with your machines or whatever uh explore those topics
  and sort of seek out deeper not depth and knowledge about those things and you can
  do that 24 hours a day seven days a week this thing will answer every question you
  have at any point forever it will never get tired it will never get annoyed there
  are no dumb questions it is always down and learning how to navigate that I think
  and so yeah so basically it will stop the traditional problems of uh student teaching
  which is like to get it it will it will break you out of broke of like fail States
  um and it will help you jump over hurdles and sort of that that space of like I
  don't know what to do I have no I'm I am so lost I don't even know which way to
  go just ask the machine and it will give you help okay so um from here so we have
  35 minutes left calm down [Music] um try I think of I what I want to do specifically
  I'm going to do this kind of in the okay I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm G to try to make
  sure I want to get y'all I'm I'm choosing between like the with the possibility
  of running out of time uh getting you sort of set up with the technical aspect of
  this versus like dumping a bunch of content on you uh I'm in traditional first day
  of class stuff I'm going to focus on the technical setup and there there's a whole
  rest of the semester left um no syllabus survives first contact with the classroom
  so if we if the schedule shifts I'm honestly okay with that um so yeah so um something
  like 20 of you have made it here already uh so to start let's start with um the
  canvas course and

  text: so I'm now starting recording and starting to talk so um let's see I gave
    myself notes so so this is a topics course which as I'm sure youall know is typically
    like topics courses are generally like they're off of the main schedule and there's
    some sort of other kind of topic that doesn't have like a proper class around
    it yet and often times those topics classes are taught to allow a professor of
    a research Professor like me to kind of like highlight their own research in a
    way that sort of doesn't fit within the standard sort of like curricula of um
    you know the university sort of the standard stem classes that you might typically
    take and uh this class so like I said I so I I am technically a professor of biology
    um even though I don't really do much biy ology because in this school um there
    isn't like a a dedicated Neuroscience Department there's the BNS um program sub
    major minor I can never remember what the status is on that but uh my research
    would kind of fit in a number of possible different departments um the most obvious
    ones being so biology because I study like you know the neural aspects of things
    and think about things such as neuron on um psychology would be I think a more
    an obvious fit because it's got the sensation and motor control kind of stuff
    um these days I do a tremendous amount of software development um in the sort
    of methods building and research sort of um research tool development side of
    life um which is a relatively recent development um I've also worked sort of close
    to robotics close to biomechanics close to physical therapy um and the specific
    specific little subdomain of research that me as an individual carves out it just
    doesn't really fit in any particular department so part of the main um structure
    of this course is to try to think about what what is the like what are the inroads
    to the to the specific thing that I study like uh which I will sort of talk about
    in a second um and the goal is to kind of give that sort of very broad survey
    of the various subtopics that sort of come together to make the specific domain
    that I study which is human movement in natural environments um but more so than
    that like my specific way of studying that because you can study a particular
    Topic in a bunch of different ways and I have come from such a weird and wild
    background that uh the sort of a interesting question of sort of how would you
    introduce someone to that field um not a field it's just sort of a

  text: thing I've learned how to do over the course of a couple decades um so there
    is something that I kind of it's something I have to say at the beginning of every
    class that I teach and I have never found a super great way to say it um but I
    don't I would not feel comfortable teaching a class to a room full of undergraduate
    people without acknowledging the moral elephant in the room um which is that none
    of this is okay none of the general structure of Academia education is morally
    defensible at almost any level uh the amount to which you are being exploited
    financially to be in this room is absolutely indefensible and unconscionable um
    and there is truly nothing that I could ever do on this side of the podium that
    would ever be worth the financial burden that's being put on you by being here
    um you can do the math if you want uh to calculate the number of people times
    the annual tuition room and board the number would come out to be something like
    $2 to3 million if you wanted to be more conservative and only count credit hours
    it would be somewhere around a quar million dollars it's indefensible Absol absolutely
    not okay and I have over the course of my four to 5 years let lose track um time
    as being as Professor here I have uh sort of had to find a lot of different ways
    of trying to handle the um the the term is moral harm uh which is the term that
    refers to the specific kind of sort of psychological trauma that occurs when you
    are forced to participate in an institution or a system that is morally repugnant
    to you in some way um I'm here for a lot of the reasons that you are here which
    is because I love learning I love teaching I love sort of the scientific exploration
    and the nature of society as it is is that the to do that at the highest level
    you sort of have to come to for legal reasons I will say institutions like this
    one um in order to participate in that and it's some it's the kind of thing that
    I didn't fully comprehend um what that all meant until I became a professor uh
    it's the kind of thing where like you're all students and you experience life
    as a student does which is basically as a a temporary person in an institution
    like this when you have a set amount of time that you'll be here that you'll go
    through you'll have the degree um and then you'll leave and then and so everything
    up to and up to the point of becoming a professor type person has that kind of
    characteristic you're an undergraduate then you're a graduate

  text: student then you're a postdoc and then if you sort of out compete your peers
    which is an insane concept why are you trying to out compete your peers you should
    work with your peers to anyways we'll get on to that um but all up until that
    point you have there is this sort of temporary nature to it and I think in retrospect
    there felt like it was a kind of um it felt more there's like a you're you're
    strugg I felt like I was struggling against the system to try to SU in that context
    and then I happened to become a professor in the summer of 2019 uh so I had about
    a year of like boy I sure did make it and this is probably fine and then summer
    of 2020 roll around covid happened and with all of the various ways that that
    affected the World At Large and me in particular um I basically just lost all
    faith in the academic and scientific systems in that summer and and uh sort of
    had a whole crisis of conscience um and tried to was trying to find ways of basically
    restructuring my life and my effort and sort of you know I've got I had 35 and
    change years at that point of not 35 directly but like close to 20 years of e
    of effort at that point to make it to this point this is a position of nonzero
    Social Power um and there is kind of this general idea of like don't give up if
    you can use it to the benefit of you know your own moral beliefs or whatever um
    and it was it was a hard and challenging thing to think about uh and just to like
    try to sort of come you know you what often times happens when you work within
    institutions which we are all forced to do is there's a conflation between the
    values that you hold um and the institutions that are sort of the vehicles for
    those values and when you lose faith in an institution which I highly recommend
    just never trust institutions trust people don't trust institutions um there was
    a whole thing of like trying to figure out like what I was actually here for what
    what my actual goals and morals and values actually are and a lot of things come
    out of that probably uh stuff that I still should not say on camera um but the
    general idea was a a shift of Focus From the doing the traditional um modes of
    research in education which was which pretty much to this day still involves uh
    do research for Publications apply for Grants produce students that will uh try
    to climb the same ladder you are on understanding entirely that that's to get
    10 you're you're supposed to produce like you know more than two of people who
    are also trying to get 10

  text: years at other school which is sort of the definition of a Ponzi scheme um
    and that was sort of the effort it's often times you you're when you're working
    in these types of systems that we tend to live in which are competition-based
    hierarchies predicated on assumptions of false scarcity uh the the game that you
    play is sort of you you're asked to compete with the people who are sort of at
    your same level in the hierarchy in order to please the people who were above
    you in the hierarchy most of whom have been in that position for longer sort of
    a gerent tocy type of thing and I realized that a lot of the effort that I was
    putting in like a a very big percentage of the effort I was I was putting into
    the world was made in the service of the people who were above me on the hierarchy
    and to do trying to do the things that they wanted me to do so that I could outperform
    my peers and be allowed to stay in you know the warm happy Shing Tower at the
    top of the hill that we are all currently in um and so one of the big changes
    that I uh sort of M brain shifts that happened was deciding to just stop doing
    that and to just stop caring or considering what I was being asked to do by people
    above me in the hierarchy and start asking instead what I could do to support
    people who were at or below me in that same hierarchy which is largely yall types
    um from a practical perspective what that turned out to be was a so in that time
    of sort of doing you know living doing research I sort of like I've got all these
    papers we'll talk about them um and with that sort of crisis of conscience uh
    there was this question of like well I don't so universities are probably evil
    um journals are definitely evil uh so but I do love the research I do love the
    teaching so what what do you do if if you don't want to you know do the dumb work
    of publishing a bunch of papers to try to make the powers that be happy um to
    you know please the gatekeeping dinosaurs above you um what do you do with your
    time um and it was around that time sort of through other modes I mean that was
    I had basically I I have a big fancy lab uh at Richard 453 which will be y'all
    will be touring with Aaron not next week CU I'll be out of town um and when Co
    hit I I had I so I showed up I had all these plans for like the research that
    I was going to do in the big fancy lab and you know they were doing the construction
    and the construction wrapped up around January uh and I was sort of gearing up
    to start the the research cycle and then quarantine hit got sort of sent home
    and had to sort of for a while just kind of flailed around trying to figure fig
    out like what am I going to do with my time

  text: what are we going to do with our time and uh at that time I wound up um basically
    there were a couple things happening in in in my lab at that point most of which
    were related to the to work in like the big fancy map lab um and then there was
    one little side project that involved uh this computer vision based method for
    doing motion capture with like Cheo webcam in free software um and so when Co
    hit I basically we shifted effort towards working entirely on that because that
    was a project that we could work on sort of remotely with ease and sort of you
    know kind of figure that out and so as so that was like March or whatever and
    then as we sort of got into the summer and that project started to sort of like
    take up pick up some steam um and I started losing faith in the system and all
    that kind of stuff I I found myself kind of of uh coming across softwares such
    as uh blender which we're going to talk about blender blender is a free open source
    Mark uh sorry uh got that sort of stuck my head it's a big free open source um
    3D animation software it's been around for some decades it's a large scale wides
    scale thing and it has been it is 100% free 100% open source and built over the
    course of decades by thousands of people across the world and given away freely
    as a gift freely given for anyone to use and benefit from and I kind of had this
    moment of realization that that was actually the thing that I wanted to be doing
    um the open source Community is what the scientific Community pretends to be like
    we pretend as scientists that we are doing that that we're working in this big
    sort of global collaborative Endeavor but it's not but practically speaking you're
    just not really able to do it so most of the research that gets done really shouldn't
    be done it's not good research it's just smart research it's strategically the
    right move to get the publication to get the grants to get the job to get the
    tenure um and it never and it often will serve like I'm not saying that all scientists
    are idiots and that all research is garbage um although the percentage is higher
    than you wish it was um but the nature of the institutions that sort of house
    it and the realities of like the hyper competitive structures of society that
    we' sort of grown for ourselves are that you're not really able to do it in a
    way that really benefits anybody outside of the club and when you see scientists
    sort of traditional scientists doing like Outreach it's often this kind of just
    like side thought like I'm going to go to a high school show them how cool it
    is to be super highly educated and then just leave and then hope that they're
    inspired enough to follow in your path out compete their peers and then maybe
    they someday can get into that shining Tower at the top of the hill um

  text: it just didn't seem right to me so uh long story short such as it is um all
    of that kind of culminated into a sort of or not culminated but sort of over the
    long course of time uh that became basically did I break it this guy this is computer
    there you go so this is Freo cap.org so this is a software that I've been working
    on with Aaron for about five years uh it's called freeo CAP it's a free open source
    marketless motion capture system and it's basically been the thing that has soaked
    up the energy that would have been spent publishing papers and trying to make
    people happy um I instead spent um building this tool to do full body motion capture
    with Cheapo garbage webcams in free software and it's been going quite well uh
    and we're going to talk plenty more about that um it's on GitHub free moap there
    there's a Discord server with looks like pushing 2500 members in it got about
    I think last I checked approaching 5,00 ,000 unique users in like 115 countries
    which is all quite good and the focus of the project and the software is to instead
    of taking my particular skill set and expertise which I have sort of accumulated
    over the course of decades Now using mostly taxpayer funding to pay my salaries
    and my paychecks um and rather than trying to use that to just publish super esoteric
    papers that will only be beneficial to other super esoteric people um the goal
    was to try to package that same use that expertise to build a tool that sort of
    meets a general need of society at large and then sort of try to serup building
    that tool as both the thing that the world wants also the tool that I want to
    do my research um and ideally trying to use that as a as a mechanism for Building
    Bridges and sort of pulling people in so a lot of the like I would say at this
    point still the majority of users of this software are animators um often young
    3D animation artists uh video game designers things like that um and also a bunch
    of you know students and grad students and you know biomechanics clinical whatever
    this that and the other um lot of dancers and musicians and things like that and
    they are using this software for their own purposes that's sort of part of it
    is like I don't want to I don't want to

  text: tell you what you should care about I'd rather just give you useful tools
    and let you do what you want to do with it um but because I with help um Global
    Wei uh designed this thing based off from my perspective I am also trying to sort
    of surreptitiously uh make this as a tool that is also kind of an educational
    platform in its own right something that will it doesn't teach you directly it's
    not giving you like lessons and quizzes but the nature of the tool is to um try
    to teach you how it works and to try to kind of basically the the idea is to give
    you kind of a greased rail into the the densest part of the forest um and then
    shine enough lights that you can sort of navigate yourself around there a lot
    of the education the general structure of Education that um yall tend to receive
    is sort of this like let's start with the basics let's start with the the simple
    boring stuff that frankly is not particularly motivating on its own because trust
    me trust me it's going to lead somewhere so cool and if you can only hang on and
    out compete your peers uh for long enough then you'll be able to see all the cool
    fun stuff um and there is actually a a reaction that I I've had more than once
    uh when I talked about the software to people where which is you should be careful
    not to make it too easy to use otherwise the students won't understand what's
    going on in there and it's like like insane to me to think that because I would
    much because the reality is that in in the natural world in the real world um
    your first reaction upon encountering something is often going to be confusion
    like when you first come across some like strange artifact that's the that's the
    least you were ever going to understand it and you will wind up if you're lucky
    uh slowly kind of back in your way into a level of understanding um and so rather
    than trying to uh basically hold your hands on a very specific path with this
    with an intended outcome of the thing that I'm trying to show you I am instead
    going to be trying to um show you a broad landscape that you are frankly that
    is frankly going to be pretty over your head for the most part and then allow
    you and give you the tools that you need to kind of Na gravitate towards the parts
    of that landscape that are the most motivating to you as individuals um and then
    allow you to kind like give you the tools that you need to kind of like back your
    way into a place of understanding and basically working your way from like the
    advanced stuff in the center of the Woods back to the beginers ship that we really
    should have started with um so that you can basically ground yourself from the
    that position but the reality is that because

    let me see where I'm at with this there's more it gets this is still context um
    right so that's so that's that's the general gist of the life that I live and
    there's a little bit of I mean the class is obviously overlapping with that General
    thing because I'm the one standing up here and your guys are over there um specifically
    within this class there is another there's another player um which is that I the
    story I was telling you about uh sort of like the loss of faith and the finding
    of the free open source thing and sort of the reshaping around this software and
    educational blah blah blah um all of that is basically you know started in roughly
    summer of 2020 and it's kind of been progressing since there I've taught a couple
    of classes sort of win that Vibe I see a couple of uh what's the word uh familiar
    faces is possibly from inquires in some cases has anyone been in a class with
    me before no who are you people um uh well yeah so and I've worked on trying to
    like teaching this type of stuff and trying this like broad landscape thing um
    and trying to incorporate as much of these sort of like beep Tech tools um as
    I could uh and then I guess it was what was it like two years ago now April two
    year and a half ago uh there was a there was a certain uh technological event
    which occurred and you heard about it um and the the hype cycle has sort of come
    and gone to the point where you're probably annoyed about it at this point but
    the thing in question is artificial intelligence um my background uh my first
    degree is in philosophy I got a a degree in philosophy focus on on philosophy
    of mind and philosophy of science there's going to be a lot of that specifically
    the philosophy of science in this course um and from there I got a PhD in cognitive
    science which is effectively AI studies these days and my particular domain within
    cognitive science which is another one of this like mish mash like sort of comedically
    broad Fields was on the like the biological side like psychology Neuroscience

    theories of language and all that stuff um and when GPT 3.5 came out like I've
    been following the various language models since you know roughly 2008 um and
    when 3.5 came out I saw and I was like oh wow this is this is getting really good
    this is really a very they've really been working over there um and then when
    GPT 4 came out it was just like okay there is now a shift has occurred and it
    is now important to take note of it um so I contacted my remember remember very
    clearly I I was uh you know I can't remember exactly the the timing of it but
    at some point I have I have a friend named John linstead uh who will probably
    come up later who's a friend from graduate school and he was much more on that
    AI side of things he was a director of the cognitive science program at Sunni
    as Wego for a while and I sort of we we got on to the Discord chat or whatever
    and he says John we need to discuss the situation uh and we both immediately knew
    that the situation was that AI exists and it is not it's not it's not like you
    don't have to worry about it as like coming to life and like biting you that's
    not a thing um and pretty much any like anything you're going to see from almost
    any source is going to be missing the point to some degree or another one of the
    nice things about being an expert is I just Bally look like oh yeah y' all have
    it wrong um but and it's not endgame and there you know there's still a lot to
    happen but the reality but it is a major shift in technology that 100% is going
    to reshape our society in a lot of predictable and unpredict ways over the course
    of the next 5 to 10 to 20 years um and not necessarily for the better uh it is
    as most Technologies it is come from the techn capitalist corpo hamani that is
    the source of so much of the sort of problems and harm in our society and in much
    the same way that they have sort of you know I'd say cause significant damage
    to our social infrastructure over the past 20 some odd years um they are going
    to attempt to continue to do that and they're going to attempt to use the anytime
    there's a new technology that comes around um the techn capitalist of just the
    capital the Corporal capitalist basically try to rush to the new domain and start
    building Moes around it so that they can sequester it and then use their access
    to that thing as a way to exploit The World At Large that is the true core of
    capitalism is to exploit disparities

    of and I think at this point um a lot of that's probably become somewhat apparent
    and there's probably uh at least a percentage of you who are sort of like feel
    like aii um because it is so overwhelmingly tied to the corpo techn capitalist
    infrastructure um but there another angle to that and I think that it can be very
    difficult to uh recognize the it's very difficult I think especially when you're
    coming at something from from like a non-expert position to discern a separation
    between the core technology that exists and the sort of implementation of that
    technology like it's hard for us to see things like gp4 on open AI as anything
    other than just like another arm of Microsoft it's hard to see whatever the hell
    it is that you know Google is trying to do is anything other than just like another
    way to steal your data and another way to shape the world around sucking $20 a
    month out of you for sort of a bunch of basic functionalities that you are going
    to eventually like require for your daily life um but I think that it's really
    important to but I I I I think that this particular technology is different because
    unlike a lot of other tools and other like so things like computers uh and phones
    and things like that like these are also World shaping Technologies and they did
    shape the world and you were sort of a part of it and I think a lot of yall are
    the both um beneficiary and harmed individuals from what happened over the C of
    the past 20 years when the entire world basic shifted towards everything that
    we do in our daily lives is going to be pushed and pulled through apps that are
    made by corporations that do not have your best interest at heart um and be and
    there was sort of an inherent that disparity between the ability to make these
    applications to build these types of Technologies um was one that was pretty easy
    to exploit because you know I can't make this I can't make a chip I can't I mean
    I guess I can build an app but it's not going to be the same thing as you would
    get from a Google or a Facebook um and so they get to use that and they get to
    use the fact that this is now an essential technology um you know we find these
    Technologies and we sort of reshape our our society to them um and there's sort
    of this limitation there um AI I think is different because it is fundamentally
    it's like they're trying to build Moes around the moat blaster 99000 like it is

    of just not working in the way that they would expect um we'll talk about that
    in in detail um I don't want to go too deep down this rabbit hole because that
    is definitely something I like to do um but I'm mostly kind of saying that just
    to sort of comment on uh the tech ick that I think is a fair uh response to this
    to the world that we live in um because I do think that sort of AI used properly
    is something that has the ability to be a a transformatively liberative uh tool
    um and one that has the potential to make every single human person that learns
    how to use it and learns how to wield it a more powerful and capable version of
    yourself um it's not a it's not an oracle that will solve all of your problems
    it is which is how it's often trying to be pushed on you um it's not a it's not
    something that's automatically going to make the world better um but it is an
    unbelievably powerful tool that if you learn how to use it what I whatever it
    is that you are trying to do in your life if it involves the generation uh ex
    sort of understanding manipulation of text on a screen AI can help with that um
    it's not automatically it won't build all your life for you but it is a unbelievably
    powerful tool with a very shallow initial learning curve and as far as I can tell
    an un unlimited maximum possibility so um that will lead us Discord don't do that
    so I live a lot of my life on Discord um wish I didn't I kind of I appreciate
    the software for what it is but I also kind of hate it for what it is um and when
    pt4 came online uh would have been like I guess spring of 2023 or something like
    that um one of the first things I did is I built a a a a bot out of it and started
    using it to teach a class um and that I taught it was a summer class and then
    I taught another version of this class last fall and then I taught a class uh
    in the Capstone in the spring didn't go so well um and then now this is is the

    so like the camera part is called Skelly cam the bot part is called Skelly bot
    uh if you're curious about it you can click on Skelly bot and then this GitHub
    link here will take you to the source code for it and I think the most important
    part of this is this phrase right here this bot help me build this bot um I could
    not have made this thing without this thing uh it like the the the skills and
    sort of like technical aspects of building a thing like this like I didn't I wasn't

    the the basics of the premot cap software because that is my domain of expertise
    this is not um I have I mean I have like an understanding theoretical understanding
    of AI but building a tool like this was beyond me but the thing about these AI
    is you just say hey could you help me with this thing and it's like yeah absolutely
    no problem 100% and it will give you an answer which is mostly right often not
    not always but often and if you learn how to navigate that and use that and sort
    of like uh surf the various ways that it is right and wrong and like learn the
    kind of things that it like like oh this is the problem that AI is going to it's
    not going to be able to do that oh it's absolutely going to be able to do that
    um if you can learn how to navigate that space and use these tools it will power
    level you through spaces that you could have have can slash your way through over
    time that you could have sat down with a real human primate expert who would explain
    it to you piece by piece um or you can just learn how to ask the machine and the
    Machine will sort of help you do these things um how exactly that happens is complex
    there's not like a quick answer it's like most complex tools it's the learning

    coming to like AI within an educational context um if you so when I up here as
    like you know career research scientist with some Decades of experience in this
    very sort of rather niched out field um like I'm not so like a lot of a lot of
    times if you're like like a a standard specialist you're like in the niche of
    a niche of a niche of a niche of a field so you're sort of like a very very specific
    person um my particular version of that is I'm within I'm like a niche of a niche
    of a niche of a niche so it's sort of like not that deep down but it's like it's
    sort of a a breath versus depth kind of thing um which can be harder to do not
    hard necessarily harder to do it takes a same amount of time but it can be harder
    to teach um because I can't assume that you all have gone through like if I if
    I was like an advanced you know epigenetics of Immunology F expert I can say okay
    have y all done like you know intro bio cell bio like you know whatever da da
    da da D all the expertises that you would need to get to this sort of level of
    spe specificity and depths um with this kind of very broad area like it's I can't
    assume that it's possible that some of you have some of the prere but none of
    you are going to have all of them because I've I've checked and pretty much one
    of the like there are roughly one person in the world that has all of my same
    background because I just I bounce around so much that the specificity that you
    get to is just kind of you become a uniqueness when you start overlapping enough
    skill sets uh pretty quickly uh which is just also just generally good career
    advice it is way easier to be unique by just combining a bunch of different things
    um and then eventually you sort of see that all the when you overlap enough vend
    diagrams and you look at sort of who is shared amongst all those V diagrams it's
    like oh wait this is actually just me um which is way sort of easier and more
    fun to do than to try to sort of out compete everybody that sort of is in the

    the base level um introduction there is prompting AI large language models in
    particular are at their core language calculators um in the same way that you
    would sort of punch a bunch of numbers into a calculator push go and it gives
    you another number L language models do roughly the same thing you you push a
    bunch of words into their context window push go and it looks at its unbelievable
    sort of uh data set and provides a statistically most likely answer um that is
    the the the expected and desired outcome of the input to the output um yeah so
    and I'm going to say this even though this this is a little bit off off of that
    topic but um the main thing that happened I think the main like there was like
    an empirical event that happened like an interesting empirical event uh that happened
    arguably with something like dpt4 um versus like the earlier incarnations of it
    which was when I was in When I Was An undergraduate in studying philosophy of
    language there was sort of this this question of does language require uh some
    sort of like native like like native genetic uh like neurophysiological um architecture
    to be able to happen like is there something special about like the the human
    evolutionary lineage that allows us to do language or the question was is it possible
    that you could just sort of extract language from a large enough data set in some
    clever statistics and when I was in undergrad at like what was that 2006 or so
    it was kind of like it's hard to say who knows and I remember at the time there
    was like you know like undergraduate right so there were like there were some
    people there who had been like the professor was sort of more attuned to like
    the the you know what was going on in the field it's like yeah those like the
    the statistical people are are making some interesting progress in that space
    but they're still not doing anything that resembles proper language and what happened
    for me as from my sort of perspective with GPT 4 was that that question was answered
    very definitively and the answer was yes um it is in fact possible to extract
    language from a large enough data set and some clever statistics without ever
    giving it explicit rules of grammar or explicit concepts of words and anything
    like that um and I consider that to be an empirical Discovery and the sort of
    from a psychological like a Psy test experiment it's sort of like how do you know
    that that happened it's like well

  text: I'm a human and I talk to it and I'm like oh yeah that's interesting like
    I I have a conversation with the machine and it's like you were definitely the
    machine is definitely doing language and that language is derived truly purely
    from the statistics of the data set which in this case represents like every Stitch
    of text that was written on the internet since 1985 um and some clever statistics
    which is basically in this case uh Transformer models which you know just uh you
    can search for that if you're interested in it um so yeah and so that's a bit
    of an aside but I think I think that that is the thing that um that was the situation
    that my friend John wared to talk about is like oh we just uh the world may not
    really may not realize it like it's this is not how I do not hear this being discussed
    in this way in in sort of the highest in in channels um but the question to the
    answer to that question has been empirically discovered and you yeah you actually
    can extract language from statistics and and we also now have and so another thing
    that happened is we now have a secondary example for the first time in history
    a secondary example of a thing that can carry out a conversation uh it's not a
    good conversation in many cases it's certainly not a human it's not really it's
    it's definitely not conscious it's but it it's a cognitive agent it does language
    math in its head and and before and you know you hear people saying like oh it's
    not really doing language because it's just like using it statistic to like to
    predict the best output and it's like y' I got some real bad news for you about
    what you're doing when you're doing language um so anyway that's yeah anyways
    that's part of the um the landscape of what's going on here um and so there is
    also a part of again like the the the ethical obligations that I feel like I have
    as the person standing on you know the chairs are facing this way uh which is
    that there is this new technology it has emerged onto the landscape I don't really
    see it being understood or utilized uh in at large so I and I am sort of like
    fairly uniquely suited to teach it use it that type of thing and so I think that
    this is one of the most useful things I can do for you is introduce you to this
    technology this tool show you how it works and teach you sort of how you can utilize
    it in your own cases even if you wind up not using it in the future it will affect
    your life um from the outside so and it like this technology like all Technologies
    they can and will be used against you so

    that I want to but I I I have used it and will continue to use it is to prompt
    the bot uh the term is prompting um to basically try to get the bot to act like
    effectively like a simulation of myself and a simulation of my expertise obviously
    the very best education that y'all could get from this class is if I sat down
    with each each one of you individually asked you what your interests were helped
    you work through things answered your questions gave you some answers and uh did
    that individually for you on call 247 every every answer um but I unfortunately
    am a limited piece of meat and that is not within my capacity um so instead I
    can make this bot which is absolutely not as good as having a sit down conversation
    with me but it's not bad and it will allow you to basically there's this question
    of like um how good are these things like you and I'm sure you get all sorts of
    sort of uh like the responses that I've seen to AI from a lot of the educational
    landscape is very defensive and it's sort of like don't use it for teaching don't
    use it for uh don't use it for your like don't use it for it's it's it's don't
    cheat don't basically don't cheat don't don't whatever write your papers blah
    blah blah it's not uh in this like it gets it wrong it's got these hallucinations
    blah blah blah like all these things sort of like try to get you not to use it
    um uh and it's true that it will get most things it it gets things wrong at some
    level and it has absolutely no idea when it's when it's saying something wrong
    there's this thing called the grounding problem uh which is just a in philosophy
    of AI is just sort like a thing um it will tell you the exactly right answer in
    the exactly wrong answer with the exact same level of confidence in itself um
    and so there is a certain L like you that's one of the things you have to learn
    is when to recognize like when it's getting things right and wrong um however
    uh there is another aspect of it which is that its ability to be right about things
    like it's is is pretty much entirely contingent on its data set uh

    what's a motor unit what's a Gogi tendon organ um it Nails all those questions
    because those are all not they if the question has been asked and answered at
    least 10,000 times since 1985 on the internet it will tend to get it right um
    and so the interesting space that you are now in so when so for me because I've
    I've been alive for long enough to have EXP uh y'all y'all don't not because you're
    dumb just because you it it takes longer than that to develop expertise like I
    have um I've been I've been studying what I study for as long as many of y'all
    have been alive um and I'm still like you know I'm starting to get to the point
    where it's like oh I most of what I know now is like I have a good enough sense
    of the landscape that I I know the difference between the things that I know the
    things that we know as a species and the things that we don't quite know as a
    species so I am I'm in a very good position to be able to talk to the bot and
    sort of to push it into area that I know like the the the really fiddly answers
    to it and I get to see it kind of go wrong and go off the rails and sort of like
    start making stuff up and start guessing and making frankly the kinds of guesses
    that I see like non-experts make like when you if you're I don't want to like
    talk down about non-research professors um but like a teaching Professor who is
    not in like the the specific domain of research that

  text: that you're talking about is like or not even teaching professors textbooks
    textbooks are mostly wrong that's kind of one of the the secrets of if if it has
    been around for long enough to be written down in a textbook it's probably wrong
    at some level it's at the very least a cartoonized version of the real thing which
    is always going to be more complex than not there it's always going to be less
    stable than you are often led to believe um one of the many bad uh yeah one of
    the many themes of this class will be acting under uncertainty and one of the
    recurrent themes there is that we know a lot we know a lot more and a lot less
    than you're often tend to taught I think that the nature of undergraduate education
    like there's tests there's quizzes there's papers there's grades um there's this
    sort of like certification system that we go through it's like yes you understand
    organic chemistry a chunk um and the nature of that is that things are often presented
    to you as if they are right or wrong true or false like what's the answer to this
    question oh it's B that's not really how the world works like there like questions
    can be like we'll get into the philosophy of science aspect of that later but
    um the world's a lot murkier than we would like for it to be and that is true
    of science it's true of every field um and I lost my point but uh yeah anyways
    so the idea will be that within this space and that the structure of this class
    is going to be encouraging you to um navigate this area and then rather and what
    AI will allow us to do uh versus an earlier era of life um is it will allow each
    of you to to navigate a much more uniquely s uh spe like you'll basically all
    be able to choose your own trajectory through this space um because the thing
    to be cons like if I'm up here giving a lecture about you know biomechanics or
    neuromechanics or something like that I I have to kind of think about like are
    they going to be able to follow any of this is this any of this going to going
    to land and like if I can't so I have to like limit the density of the things
    I say to try to make sure that like at least a percentage of you can sort of follow
    the plot um but what is this is it25 is the class over yeah um but one thing I
    get to do with AI and I'm going to give it a shot at the I think we'll have we
    should have time but um we actually start talking about the content of the class
    uh but one of the things that I that this allows me to do is to be much much much
    denser in the information that I present to you um because because I can I will
    I'm going to talk about things that are going to be over your head uh

  text: and it's going to come real fast and you're not going to follow all of it
    I can guarantee you already um but that's going to be okay because I'm going to
    record it and then once I record it I'm going to scrape the audio put it into
    the AI as like an outline of topics put that in one of the channels and then one
    of the assignments will be go ask the bot about whichever as like which which
    part of this was the most interesting to you which part of this was the most confusing
    to you which part of this do you wish I had said more about which part of this
    did I say something about but you didn't follow it at all um and so my goal will
    be to say all the things that need to be said um to say in a way that you that
    you know that you can follow because you're all smart people um and your job is
    going to be to basically uh stand in front of the fire hose and try not to let
    your brain turn off entirely and try to just let it wash over you and to notice
    when you have something that sort of like wakes up like when I mention some this
    or that or some topic over here or some topic over there uh to notice what those
    things are and then in your own time and with your machines or whatever uh explore
    those topics and sort of seek out deeper not depth and knowledge about those things
    and you can do that 24 hours a day seven days a week this thing will answer every
    question you have at any point forever it will never get tired it will never get
    annoyed there are no dumb questions it is always down and learning how to navigate
    that I think and so yeah so basically it will stop the traditional problems of
    uh student teaching which is like to get it it will it will break you out of broke
    of like fail States um and it will help you jump over hurdles and sort of that
    that space of like I don't know what to do I have no I'm I am so lost I don't
    even know which way to go just ask the machine and it will give you help okay
    so um from here so we have 35 minutes left calm down [Music] um try I think of
    I what I want to do specifically I'm going to do this kind of in the okay I'm
    gonna I'm gonna I'm G to try to make sure I want to get y'all I'm I'm choosing
    between like the with the possibility of running out of time uh getting you sort
    of set up with the technical aspect of this versus like dumping a bunch of content
    on you uh I'm in traditional first day

  text: of class stuff I'm going to focus on the technical setup and there there's
    a whole rest of the semester left um no syllabus survives first contact with the
    classroom so if we if the schedule shifts I'm honestly okay with that um so yeah
    so um something like 20 of you have made it here already uh so to start let's
    start with um the canvas course and
