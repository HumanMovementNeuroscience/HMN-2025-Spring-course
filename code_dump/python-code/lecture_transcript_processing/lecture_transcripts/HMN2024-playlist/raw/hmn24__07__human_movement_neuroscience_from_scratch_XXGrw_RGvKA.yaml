full_transcript: okay all right hello everybody uh welcome to this world um yeah so
  today we're going to talk about uh Evolution which is a big topic lot going on and
  we're kind of going to what's the word um speedrun through a lot of details and
  then we're eventually going to get to the part that's sort of more directly related
  to like the human movement part so arguably this is about the evolution of human
  movement um I no AI updates I'm working on some stuff but nothing that has actually
  produced uh something sharable so we'll get there um I next week or the week after
  we'll figure it out um yes let's go ahead and feel like there's more to say at the
  beginning is there anything to say semester is coming to an end there is a sort
  of two or three four classes left no one knows maybe three after this after this
  I think it's like either three or four but um next week Thanksgiving week yeah Thanksgiving
  week is going to be kind of like a fake week cuz I I I'll do stuff um that will
  be relevant but I know how I know how this goes um so I'll try to make that non
  essential not that any this is um so maybe next week will be the one where I talk
  about my actual research because I think this is the hypothetically like the not
  not the culmination but like I think once I'm done with this stuff you will have
  at least hypothetically sufficient background um well I will have sufficient I will
  have said sufficient background to be able to talk about my research with at least
  not most of it being completely new um so we'll see we'll figure it out um y'all
  just show up and try not to fall asleep um but if you do I understand you're tired
  um okay so starting from the beginning Big Bang Boom Universe explodes that's kind
  of where we start from so the Big Bang is our current culturally preferred creation
  myth um it is like all good creation stories it explains a lot but it doesn't explain
  everything um the Japanese at one point in their history thought that Japan was
  formed by a giant sword stabbed in then the droplets makes uh where the drops fell
  that's where the islands fell doesn't explain a ton but it does explain why the
  islands are the way that they are um the Genesis 11 vision of of the world is that
  God made light cuz it was dark and then he like made a bubble cuz the ancient Hebrews
  thought that we were in like an infinite ocean so he made firmament for the ground
  and then thick stars for the top and then that's where we lived and then people
  eventually were like wait but there's all these like the fixed Stars don't move
  but there's these ones that do move those are probably planets so let's make maybe
  we're in spheres and so the planets are the Spheres and the outer sphere is the
  fixed stars and then Galileo invented the telescope and looked at I was like wait
  there's something orbiting that one too so maybe we're orbiting the Sun and then
  eventually we sort of got better and better telescopes got better and better data
  we started noticing weird things like the universe is expanding that's strange things
  every everywhere we look things are moving away from us and if you're like if you
  think about yourself as a as like a dot in a grid on the outside of a balloon everywhere
  you would look things would be expanding so Hubble looking around not the guy but
  the telescope um saw that kind of stuff happening we we invented things called radio
  telescopes we saw this thing called the background radiation and if you extrapolate
  all those things out then if you sort of play the clock back then about 12 billion
  years ago or so everything is going to be in the same place and what comes before
  that well we don't really know what comes after that everything that we do know
  or not really what comes before that we don't know slash within this cosmology there's
  no way to discuss that question um and so the Big Bang explains a lot um but it
  doesn't explain everything for example if it if that if it was just that simple
  big boom story where we would look things would be slowing down they're not they're
  speeding up if we had a good sense of where the energy lived in the world we could
  look at galaxies and predict their speed we can't we're off by like 70% and we call
  the difference Dark Energy um so we know that this cosmology is not like true but
  we believe that it is more true than the previous things because it helps us make
  better and more precise predictions that's Carl Popper's long and short of philosophy
  of science and we'll go with it for now so big bang explodes um all the energy and
  all the universe of all time is created in that moment so we say remember when people
  talk about um things like the uh what's it called conservation of energy that's
  the energy that they're talking about and the thought is that there was a bunch
  of something something happened there was a bunch of matter a bunch of antimatter
  it obliterated itself and the obliterated matter anti matter became all the energy
  in the universe mostly in the form of Light which is just part of the electromagnetic
  spectrum and for some strange reason when that thing happened there was some left
  over there was some matter left over and if you're curious about that Emily N is
  a physicist of old back lady scientist before that was okay um who T who looked
  at symmetry breaking math in physics so the question of why there's anything left
  over that's what she's talking that's who knows but here we are so there was clearly
  something left that did not obliterate itself and that's roughly the stuff that
  we're standing on so big explosion 12 billion years ago uh and for a good little
  while everything is too hot to do anything useful um as the universe expands the
  gasses cool down and things start to form shapes your positrons and your electrons
  and all your quirks and nonsense sort of started showing up eventually it gets bigger
  that stuff cools down even further and you get things like protons and electrons
  they meet up and become hydrogen and this is where we start getting closer to biology
  hydrogen good start so those hang out in the form of nebula which are big cloudlike
  things uh and they're made out of matter matter has gravity so that you get a big
  cloud it's going to start to condense on itself so the clouds start to condense
  until eventually they get so smooshed in that they get super hot and the hydrogen
  fuses into helium it's called Fusion because it fuses together hydrogen into helium
  is a super energetic explosion um and so it fights against the collapsing gravity
  of the nebula and explodes outwards and that sort of equilibrium of explosion and
  collapsing is what we call Stars uh that is also the origin of our good friend helium
  not particularly useful in biology that's you get one hydrogen one hydrogen put
  them together you get two atomic weight that's helium so for a good while that's
  all we got to just a bunch of hydrogen nebula fusing into stars that are burning
  hydrogen to get helium and then that goes on for a while until some of the Stars
  start to burn out all of their hydrogen and are left with nothing but helium when
  they when that process stops the helium stars now collapse um because it takes more
  energy to fuse helium that it does to fuel Hy fuse hydrogen but they collapse so
  hard that they get so hot that it fuses into like burum or something like that um
  which is a less energetic process but it's enough to fight the the collapse and
  you get a new type of stars that process continues they burn through their subsequent
  elements and you get basically all the chemistry that we need for regular old biology
  the top row on the periodic table uh what's it called periodic table Yeah you got
  your hydrogen you got your helium you got your lithium you got your burum and you
  got these are all of our very good friends here once you get to oxygen you start
  getting a ton of water hydrogen plus oxygen equals water it's one of the most common
  things in the universe and that process of the stars burning through their fuel
  and doing Fusion on in less and less efficient methods works all the way up until
  about iron and once you get to iron and you start trying to do Fusion on iron that
  process is not strong enough to produce the explosive force you need to stop the
  collapsing of the star and then the star collapses all the way way and for some
  stars that are big enough they do this kind of wacky thing where as they're collapsing
  they hit that Fusion point for the later stuff and it sort of but just kind of like
  like slam slam slam and then eventually explode in the form of supernova and whereas
  the first part can take millions and millions and millions and millions of years
  that last part of this the Supernova part takes like 2 weeks which is up um but
  anyways that's where all the rest of this stuff comes from and that's how all of
  this stuff gets out into the universe so now we've got a universe with elements
  in it those elements continue to cool down till eventually they form these accretion
  discs and the and the some of the accretion sort of silicates or this first silicone
  this silicone um forms rocky planets uh we live on one of those rocky planets the
  ground is from those Stars so whenever you hear people say like oh we're made of
  star dust star stuff stard dust that's what they're talking about so yeah and so
  that's so that's step one that's how you get planets planets are very important
  for evolution um probably uh they're at least in in one case a sufficient condition
  so you get solar systems solar system have planets some of them are big gas giants
  like your Jupiter's and your Neptunes some of them are small rocky sort of chunks
  uh like Earth and Mars and those and folks like that for the majority of Earth's
  existence it was not habitable to anything at all it was it's hot it's magma it's
  very sort of uh it's hot magma and it's got no atmosphere so it's getting hit by
  solar radiation bad time bad news um nothing really um no complex chemistry can
  really show up in that space cuz it's too violent um but if you recall there's a
  lot of water in the world a lot of water in the universe hydrogen is the first guy
  on the show oxygen is not far after and there are some Stellar bodies out there
  that just do nothing but spit out a trillion times the amount of water on Earth
  every second for a billion years if you go flying around this flying around in space
  you're going to find a lot of rocks of water ice eventually the Earth sort of clears
  out its orbit because it's all the parts just Clump up together um so you get less
  meteorite impacts which is good for Life uh and you also get a lot of water because
  a lot of those chunks are chunks of ice and so you start to get things like oceans
  oceans are super useful things for life because they're water so they if they're
  liquid water then they temperature range is sort of like reasonable um and they're
  also very good at blocking radiation so we have we live on the surface of our planet
  so we mostly rely on air of various forms to block our radiation along with our
  Earth's magnetic field does a pretty good job with the solar wind another great
  solution is you don't have a good atmosphere is live underwater um and so if you're
  curious about not I don't nothing follow up here but like there places in most of
  the water in the solar system is not on Earth it is on a combination of moons the
  Jovi and moons Enceladus uh Europa these are ice moons that have a thick sheath
  of ice and beneath that sheath of ice we have recently discovered we have geologically
  active planets and warm water oceans um so who knows what's hanging out in there
  um anyway so here we are on earth it's hot it's bad there a lot of radiation but
  we've got oceans and so once we get into the oceans we can start to form various
  goop goop is a good precursor to life I don't know much about this I'm sure there's
  much more that can be said about the specifics of this goop but at some point the
  goop becomes fancy goop uh and the fancy goop is I'm going to say roughly speaking
  RNA uh uh ribonucleic acid mRNA uh I guess it's not an M because it's not got nothing
  to message but RNA is a very important type of goop because it is self-replicating
  self-replication like just the nature of the orientation of the who's itss and the
  what's itss the hexagons and sticks and the carbons and the hydrogens that came
  from the Stars it makes copies of itself wild move how we got the goop we kind of
  understand it's just stuff gops up like some a lot of the nebula that are out there
  are like literally ethanol like you could go scoop some up and drink it and get
  drunk like like fancy chemistry is not hard to find um and you put it together it
  gets goop that thing where it becomes the self-replicating molecule who knows it
  could just be a numbers game like you just let it hang out for long enough um in
  a place that is protected from radiation and meteors and too hot of temperatures
  and things like that and you just get things like RNA who knows I don't but I know
  that that in at least one case it is possible to happen at least one time and that
  is called the anthropic principle uh which is the concept that we know that the
  universe is capable of creating supporting life because if it wasn't then I wouldn't
  really be able to ask the question so in at least one at least one case at least
  one time at least one planet that roughly resembles this one it is possible for
  something like RNA to emerge and once you have something like RNA the process of
  evolution and begin because when you have uh something that replicates it will replicate
  imperfectly um and so you start and that starts off this kind of genetic algorithm
  uh which is a fun thing to Google it's like a that's genetic algorithms are kind
  of a computer science term but they're based off of basic Evolution the idea is
  that if you have something self-replicating and it's self-replicating with variation
  some of those variations will be better at surviving than other of those variations
  and if the if the mutations are heritable then that process kicks off a pretty interesting
  cascade of events uh leading up to and including this moment right now the so you
  start from so so now you've got self-replicating mrnas eventually they form into
  things which we what we might call cells um I will show a animation in in a second
  but we'll go through this with words for now cells are basically a shell it's you
  have a you make a membrane lipid Bator if you're into that kind of stuff and now
  you have invented something very interesting in the history of life and that is
  an inside and an outside there's a there's a part that is sequestered from the rest
  of the universe and it has its own sort of situation going on on the inside which
  is separated from the outside which is everything you are also one of these types
  of thing the cells are pretty lame for a while it's like ARA which I don't they
  don't even have they don't have organel they just kind of like float around um this
  might somewhere in this process you get light sensitivity that's where eventually
  we we that's eventually this kind of stuff light sensitivity once you start having
  things that have inside and outside you might say they have a sense they that's
  a that's an organism um and that organism at some point will start developing the
  ability to sense the environment if absorb some environmental energy convert it
  into some internal State and then at some other point put Force into the world that
  will allow it to change its position relative to everything else hemo sensation
  is thought to be the first sense that smell the ability to sense chemical gradients
  it's like hey there's food in this direction I'm going to go there there oh that's
  poison I'm going to go this way that's smell chemo sensation at some other point
  um light is also light sensitivity is somewhere on the list of Senses we picked
  up and it's thought that the the first origins of light sensitivity was in like
  Plankton like objects that might want to go up when the Sun is up and go down when
  the sun is down so all you need to do is know is to have something in your body
  that absorbs photon and have some other chemical process that moves in the direction
  of that thing or maybe you're in the water so you don't even go in the direction
  of light you just go up who knows um this is now at some point here we also develop
  directionality you have forward that's a good useful thing we we we started with
  inside we started with everything then we have inside now we have forward um Good
  Start uh we get better cells we Aras and your basic bacterium sort of that the majority
  of life is is that we're mostly just hanging out single C or we're mostly just hanging
  out as like hydrogen and whatnot but for the parts that we have been living beings
  mostly it's in the sort of bacterial archa um simple cell type of Lifestyle eventually
  it is thought that cells fig fig out how to eat each other and then once some guy
  some guy ate some other guy and the other guy that got ate was like I'm not going
  to die I'm just going to become organel and that's how you get UK carots the biology
  majors in the room are having which is all of you may have opinions on that story
  but that's roughly speaking what is what I believe happened um eventually these
  cells start to Clump together you get multicellular life this is another great move
  it probably started with just like mats and then kind of sort of simple things like
  sponges which have the like the the line between bacterial eukariotic colony and
  multicellular life sort of murky as all this stuff is um at some point well between
  here and here things start to um develop another great idea which is mouth uh mouth
  is opening um and between here and Here Mount there's in is in is the same as out
  this is there's only one opening and S you're basically just like a tube uh you're
  not yet you're not yet a tube um around this time this is sort of thought to be
  like hanging out around uh geothermal plumes at the bottom of the ocean um this
  is has the advantage of being underwater so you protect it from the radiation um
  near warmth because the geothermal plumes are hot and there's Al and also near weird
  chemistry because the geothermal plumes are spitting out weird stuff from the center
  of the earth and so it's a so it's a pretty good move to just sort of anchor yourself
  to the spots near the plumes and just be a weird sort of worm like creature which
  again is why I think it's really cool that when they flew they found plumes coming
  off of Europa big geysers and they flew Cassini or something through the plumes
  and smelled the mist and found uh things like methane um which is a kind of thing
  that life makes but not mshell so on Europa there is at the beneath a crust of ice
  and a warm water ocean there is there are things like geothermal events spewing
  complex chemistry into space but that's not important right now some other point
  someone else made a very I think uh super important Discovery uh more of an organizational
  principle which is to have two holes one for in and one for out that was a great
  move that I think we're all very grateful for that's roughly where we still are
  basically aside from all the details you're all tubes with a bunch of weird stuff
  around it and everything is sort of organized around that sort of central tube uh
  that goes in and out and that is the origin of worms good friends worms folks like
  sea elegans there's a lot of worm people in this department um biology has often
  study of worms um and then once you get to a particular worm named C elegans I don't
  think this is how this happened evolutionarily but you get such a thing as a nervous
  system nervous systems have neurons neurons are cells that Spike um and I don't
  really have time to get into all the details there if talk about it some Point probably
  heard about it at some point nerves very good useful things um C Elegance has 302
  uh which is the smallest complete nervous system that we're aware of um I don't
  know how old they are but they've been around for a while eventually you moving
  on from there you get to another great point in time which is sort of internal structure
  so you start getting I mean I don't the details get I don't know the details here
  but like you get uh your gastropods you get your slugs and you get your worms and
  eventually you get your Cordata which is roughly speaking things with a spine um
  that's your uh you also have like your mollusk and your clams and probably crabs
  at some point too ex exoskeleton types they're great but they're not us so we can
  sort of Branch off from them uh uh at some point in this process I think maybe before
  the Cordata I'm not 100% sure on that you get this invention of something else which
  is way less chill which is predation someone figured out that if I if I can just
  sit around making my own body my whole life it's very very hard very expensive if
  I just eat you then I can get all the energy that you've been growing your whole
  life and then I don't have to do that and somewhere in there you get the inent sort
  of the development of the Predator prey sort of arms race and that is thought to
  be a major driver of evolution because if all you're doing is sitting around sucking
  weird chemistry out of geothermal vents there's not a lot of pressure to really
  be the biggest worm on the Block but if the biggest worm on the Block starts trying
  to eat you now you got to start try to figure out how to deal with that situation
  and that is sort of roughly speaking thought to be what we call the Cambrian explosion
  which was a time the Cambrian Period where you just start seeing a whole ton of
  weird life showing up you start seeing all sorts of much more speciated uh much
  more advanced sort of organisms growing up showing up and at some point in that
  process you get the bony fish which oh I did shut this down that's too bad um so
  oh look a paper let's pretend I'm not on campus one of the of the many ways that
  you are that the harms of this places like this are are hidden from you is that
  when you're on campus papers just show up if you're off campus it's like pay $40
  to get this paper so even when you're on campus get in the habit of just taking
  the URL or the DOI going to SI Hub uh the specific URL changes so you can just search
  for it oh not you MK yeah this guy with the uh Crow punch it in there punch it in
  there and there you go it'll look different because I have this dark weer extension
  that makes everything dark mode um evolution of gay shifting eye movements I love
  this paper this is a paper by Mark land written in 2019 it may have been his last
  paper he died of Co which is sad in a large a lot of variety reasons um he's arguably
  my grand adviser my adviser Mary heho I mentioned in the eye tracking stuff studied
  with him he's a he did a lot of the original work on like eye movements and natural
  behavior this paper is spectacular and it basically talks about how everything is
  everything in nature uses everything in nature that has good vision has a has sort
  of a very similar sad and fixate strategy that we do uh as humans sods and fixations
  a universal pairing um so he goes this paper goes through and looks at these look
  familiar to you so these are IM movements these are head movements then you take
  head plus I and you get gaze which has these sort of stable moments out in the world
  that's for that's for the author's left eye looking around a room this is the kind
  of papers you get to write if you're doing stuff like that then he Compares this
  to other guys so these are a goldfish making a turn these are head movement a rabbit
  tracking something uh birds are interesting for a lot of reasons but not the least
  of which that their eyes are an appreciable percentage of the weight of their head
  um so we stabilize our gaze by having our big honken heavy heads and our thick short
  stiff necks move our head around and we stabilize our gaze at the eye level birds
  have very long and flexible necks so they stabilize their gaze at the head level
  but they can't really make much eye movements but they still have that sort of same
  like sacot and fixate style of gaze it's just happening at the level of their heads
  you ever look up those videos people like moving a chicken around and the head stays
  fixed it's V at the head level it's a vestibulo colic reflex colic for head this
  is a chameleon this is a rock crab this is a stock eyed fly and they're all kind
  of doing the same sort of thing because they're all using the same opsins the same
  basic chemistry the chemicals that respond to photons and light they're all using
  the same basic chemistry there and they're all and that opson operate in roughly
  the same way which is that they respond to light they're very useful as these sort
  of biological light sensors but they're relatively slow like they move takes some
  10 of milliseconds for them to respond to light and then some tens of milliseconds
  for them for the light for them to like reset um which if you look at a bright light
  in a loal way that after effect is because your opos in that part of your retina
  haven't reset yet so land argues that this Coten fixate strategy is absolutely just
  like a it's a fundamental aspect of having a good visual system so he argues and
  and so and he argues by talking about this guy walls uh who wrote a paper in 1962
  which I tried to read I tried to read it's just like it's it's like that old style
  so it's just very very long with like no pictures so I I trust mikeland to have
  told me that the argument there is that we have evidence for the origin of eye movements
  uh stretching back to the bony fish which is roughly 450 million years ago tree
  of life yeah this is the one I want open perfect there we go so these are those
  fishy guys so the way you read this is this is Earth birth um and then the outer
  each one of these Rings is like time goes outward from this space and so you start
  with these bacteria and these ARA and these UK carots plants show up plants are
  useful we eat those they're great they they uh eventually turn the atmosphere into
  oxygen which causes a climate catastrophe and things poison themselves because oxygen
  is like really intense but we get over that um there's also a period of time in
  our history called the Carboniferous period which is the space between the evolution
  of plants and the evolution of fungi which is basically a period of life on Earth
  where plants are out here specifically Woody plants are out here making cellulose
  which is really hardcore like chemically bonded and when they when then they die
  there's nothing on the planet that knows how to break those cellulose bonds so all
  the plants that die just hang out on the ground and they turn into things like petrified
  wood um they burn there was apparently like like like wildfires that were the size
  of continents because forests would just die and just never go anywhere um they
  also turn into all fossil fuels the all the fossil fuels on the planet these like
  repositories of like rarified carbon change hydrocarbon change and oil and coal
  and stuff like that is from that this Gap period here um and it's typically things
  like bogs and swamps and stuff like that because it the the plant matter would die
  but it wouldn't be broken up and sort of get back into the sort of ecosystem it
  would sort of sequester there so you know fossil fuel super useful you can do a
  lot of stuff with it some problems with using it too much too fast uh we'll see
  how that goes um but then eventually fungi show up and they learn how and they know
  how to eat cellulose and so the Carboniferous furi ends and now trees can rot and
  go back into the carbon cycle and uh thanks thanks for y'all Proto stes this is
  these are your weirdos this is like the weird camb exp like if you ever look at
  like old animals they're weird as hell they have like weird spirals there's like
  Spiral mouthed things this is from that like Cambrian explosion era see this how
  things kind of just like spike out there oh yeah there was ice ages it's fine um
  mass extinction events there's a bunch of Max mass extinctions but it's okay right
  around here this is your these are your bony fish these are these are the first
  guys that made eye movements uh presumably it could be that some of the other guys
  did too but there's also this issue where uh bones make fossils shells make fossils
  slugs don't make good fossils so there were probably guys there's eye stocks and
  things like that but bony fish have a skeleton bony fish have a spine bony fish
  have muscles and those muscles are attached to eyeballs and so eye movements roughly
  around here doing great biologically at some point we decide that we don't like
  the ocean anymore it's too crowded people keep eating us they have weird mouths
  so someone decides to crawl out onto the land um that guy was basically like a sort
  of a mud skipper type of fish hang thought to be they would go out lay eggs go back
  in and that keeps your eggs from getting eaten cuz the only thing on the on the
  ground is are these plants hanging out and they don't eat any anybody they're chill
  they just suck up light and do the KB cycle which is super inefficient but it works
  um eventually the guys decide that they like going out onto land and they uh get
  their flippers become hands and their back flippers become feet and they're crawling
  around and they're basically they're lizard-like guys this is the worth of tetrapod
  these are the first tetrapods tetrapods are roughly this shape head torso upper
  arms lower lower limbs uh tail optional um well I guess it's a spine sort of thing
  um yeah so those guys hung out for a long time and then eventually they become so
  you get you get your dinosaurs you get your birds um birds have been birds are basically
  the first bipeds they beat us to the punch there like by like 200 million years
  they are better at bipeds than better at bipedalism than we are spent a lot of time
  in grad school arguing the opposite I have come to terms with the fact that 200
  million years of evolution makes you makes you good at having two feet they have
  like the very short femur very long shank and then the sort of like uh like whatever
  the name of that sort of toe joint thing TMJ whatever that stands for um yeah they
  don't have a backward knee um it's their ankle uh their knee is up usually in their
  plumage so that's fine uh so yeah they hang out for a while they become you know
  you got your your your dinosaurs with two legs you got your sort of quadrupedal
  dinosaurs they hang out for a good long time uh eventually you get um where is it
  probably roughly one of these mass extinctions comes along uh you get such things
  as the Gulf of Mexico as a result and all the dinosaurs tend to die off um or become
  Birds that's their those are their options and a lot of them chose death and some
  of them chose bird and we are grateful to we we trust them to make those decisions
  for themselves now amongst the little crawly boys uh some of them were developing
  things like fur and warm blood um the first mammals were basically tree shrew looking
  things sort of like squirrel like guys hanging out in trees AR Boreal they hang
  out in trees they run around on branches now this is a great move for us eventually
  because if you're hanging out on branches then you're going to need to have grasping
  because the trees are very thin um and so as these guys are running around the tops
  of trees trying to avoid getting eaten by dinosaurs they're small so they don't
  need much food they're warm blood flooded so they're more they're more uh resilient
  to to sort of massive climate upheavals and in the as in as the dinosaurs are all
  dying because of the because of the invention of the Gulf of Mexico uh these guys
  are doing just great um and so as they start they're running around in the trees
  with their little hands and the little feet and eventually they turn into something
  more resemblant of not that there's another picture here this one you get you get
  all sorts of weird ones you get your platypuses your aidas um sort of your strange
  animals and eventually you get to such such guys as primates uh primat sort of basically
  souped up tree shoes um not sure exactly what to say about that transition there
  other than like we did it um and we're going to go into some more detail about that
  particular transition so we start from these we go from being arboreal uh walking
  around in trees with grasping hands we come and then uh primates are I'm not sure
  what the term term is um but they they go back and forth they they hang out largely
  in trees but they also come down to the ground they're not very good at being bipeds
  they can stand upright but their skeleton isn't really shaped right so they're knuckle
  walk Walkers so they're kind of they're they are most they're quadrupedal on these
  kind of like grasping appendages that kind of like this is kind of how they do uh
  we'll go into detail there um some detail quite some detail so yeah so we have now
  gotten from roughly Big Bang down to these grabby handy tree shrews uh Mamon grab
  grabby tree shrews this is a very good place to be uh the we are mammals and we
  have and this guy the current guy and the previous one from God that would have
  been like probably like 20 million years ago talking about like my childhood like
  God can you remember back in that day um this is a mammal it has a mamalian nervous
  system it is roughly the same pieces and parts as yours very funh house mirrored
  very the parts are some parts are bigger some parts are smaller but this guy has
  roughly your same skeleton roughly your same organs roughly your same nervous system
  roughly your same eyeballs and everything from this point on is just sort of fun
  house mirror stretching and pulling into other forms uh and for now I'm going to
  I'm going to find this Sean um so this guy's Carl Sean Carl Sean is the best Carl
  Sean is one of my FV probably favorite science Communicator of all time easily uh
  yeah and he has this show called Cosmos highly recommend watching it it's super
  dated so you kind of have to just get past the fact that it was made in the80s um
  but if you like the whole existential anxiety component of this class this is really
  going to do you quite well cuz it's all about his sort of like trying to make peace
  with the fact that it's just you're we're just not up for the task that's what the
  whole show is about um and it had this very famous animation which I will present
  to you what has changed here ah by the way this like speed run through from like
  the birth of time until the evolution of humans this this is like a classic move
  uh and it's kind of inspired by this so like how well do you know your creation
  myth no no no let's do it on YouTube no not that even minute one there you go so
  no no lipid bilayer organel UK carots multicellular stuff this is the mouth that's
  the The Rock wor these are the guys that hang up by the geothermal vents uh they
  become kind of worm this is the fish and get the hands bony fish skeletons eye movements
  crawl out of the water lizard guy uh demetron uh some sort of tre shrew this is
  your Tre shrew these are your old school Apes with the Tails these are your new
  school Apes without the Tails they stand up they walk around hello now we're here
  we did it and as he says these are some of the things that molecules do given 12
  billion years of evolution Tada yeah the Cosmic calendar is how he did and this
  little pixel right down here that's all of all of life on Earth yeah you yeah dive
  into that pool at your leisure uh it is your birth right okay so after the tree
  of shrews we get the Apes um apes and monkeys monkeys and apes uh the term monkey
  is not a evolutionarily distinct uh thing it uh evolutionarily actually I can do
  this I don't need to draw this primates old school Old World New World so uh notice
  the eurocentric imperialism in the naming conventions here but you have your old
  school monkey old old world monkeys which refer which old world monkeys is like
  Africa New World monkeys is the Americas um and and the old Ro monkeys the other
  ones are you got your MAAC so when we do research on non-human primates it's typically
  maacs that's your bamboon your baboons and your whatnot um then you have your Apes
  which is your Gibbons and your orangutans and you have your great apes which is
  US gorillas bonaos and chimpanzees um so the term monkey isn't on here except as
  in this distinction between old world and New World monkey so it monkeys doesn't
  exist phog gentically if it did we would be monkeys uh which I mostly just use to
  if anyone ever says we're not monkeys were Apes be like well actually you can hit
  them with that if you so choose um but yeah so let's see how Okay and then now I'm
  going to go here because I know that they have there we go so bunch of skulls we
  are born we have skulls time is going back here so this is the past and this is
  the future um we this is actually starting a little later than I would want um so
  this is the so this guy right here is asopus afarensis otherwise known as a afarensis
  a Aeris Lucy uh you hear sometimes about this cool lady named Lucy and she is roughly
  speaking a bedal ape um the actual Lucy that we refer to is is a skeleton that we
  found I think this is actually at UT Austin I'm not quite sure um typically when
  we find these remains they're they're not they're not complete like we don't find
  them looking like this we find little chunks and pieces um Lucy in particular um
  we got this uh which was which is very complete for in in sort of fossil record
  style um and Lucy is she was famous because it that you know we found a very good
  complete skeleton but there were a bunch of these sort of bipedal aplike creatures
  just all sorts of them we keep finding new new of them um you can tell kind of the
  so the genus is the first word and then the species is the second one or both or
  whatever um we're homos uh but then we have all these other ones um so asopus is
  like a particular genus but it gets murky like you like the separation is hard to
  really carve out because you usually get these like just bone chunks and you keep
  finding new ones like we recently found a ton of homoni just like we found a cave
  that just stuffed full of them Google it it's great um they like the cave like you
  have to be like they could the research team had to be a bunch of really tiny people
  because they had to be able to like crawl in through the like small Spelunky holes
  um but anyways but we want to go but let's go back one step further from this and
  talk about uh Arty arpus ramidus [Music] Rus ramidus and less popular than Lucy
  but still pretty good arpus ramidus means the grounded ape um this is thought to
  be the last common the last ancestor that we share with the other great apes so
  uh Lucy is not in the family tree of chimpanzees and bonobos and gorillas arpus
  ramidus is and Arty was able to stand up pretty okay uh had some sort of the pelvis
  we'll talk about the pelvis in a second here um but wasn't a particularly well adapted
  biped notice the feet got these graspy feet things this unfortunately is going to
  be the class where I take my shoes off not quite yet um but if you'll notice the
  we the grabby grabby tree shoes um they still have the grabby on the feet uh which
  means that this guy was thought to be a sort of a a a bad weather biped basically
  the um what's it called Africa you heard of that place where we're from um oh uh
  Lucy was found in the old Devi Gorge which is in Tanzania uh which we will talk
  about briefly but um so this is Africa you may have heard of it um this right here
  is called it's like the great something Rift or something like that and it basically
  like it's geologically very active and it sort of like pulls apart and pushes together
  over the scale of like couple like thousands of years and so this will periodically
  become kind of like this which is like a bunch of like livers and rivers and lakes
  and stuff like that and then it will push together and become PLS and things like
  that so if you are an arboreal guy that lives in the jungle it's sometimes you might
  need to come down from the trees and walk from this clump of trees to that clump
  of trees and to do that you might have to go across Plains where there's things
  like lions and stuff like that so it's probably pretty good to be a little bit better
  at walking so that you can go from One Tree copes to another and not get eaten in
  the vicinity of that the second you start doing that you start getting these these
  very well- evolved appendages that we've been evolving for all these millions and
  millions of years but now for some of your life you're not actually using them for
  anything like they're out they're there they're attached they're very good at grabbing
  they're very attached to our perceptual system because of the because of the the
  arboreal thing um but we're no longer using them for Locomotion uh which is a bold
  move kind looks like you're r a skateboard here that any see that just not relevant
  um uh and so yeah this so Arty is thought to be kind of like the beginning of the
  evolution of obligate by pism obligate means like we don't really have many other
  choices here like like you know bears and chimps and gorillas they're mostly knuckle
  walkers but they can stand up on two feet we kind of suck at everything but bipedalism
  so we are obligate bipedal obligate bipeds um there's this great paper by this guy
  I don't know why this doesn't quite work h once again grabb the link go to saub
  second one down I guess so there's this paper so this guy Co Lovejoy um is a paleontologist
  he say does a lot of stuff on human evolution he has this great three-part paper
  on the evolution of human gate and posture that talks about the spine and pelvis
  and femur and knee and stuff like that um a lot of what I'm going to be saying about
  the skeleton is sort of based off of that but he wrote this great paper about artus
  ramidus 2009 um because art was discovered relatively recently too it's sort of
  like every you'll hear this thing every so often we found a missing link it's like
  yeah great we found another one um but he wrote this paper about uh the evolution
  of bism which has what is perhaps my favorite uh section my favorite paragraph I've
  ever read um so one of the things that happens a lot in this area of research or
  the human evolution is everyone's always trying to sort of like these days we try
  not to like lean too hard into it but there's always this kind of question about
  like what does our history say about us now uh and one of the sort of core essential
  questions of like are we just sort of like inherently violent Monsters by nature
  or are we or or is the sort of the care and kindness part of us is that also core
  are we fighting against our nature when we do care and kindness or or is that is
  that inbuilt as much as the violence and death and often that is kind of um if we
  look at our nearest Cousins we have chimpanzees and bonobos um chimpanzees are relatively
  violent creatures uh I'm not going to talk too much about it but um perhaps my favorite
  living scientist uh what's her name Jane Goodall did a lot of really important work
  in discovering that chimpanzees are not just pure violent they have like complex
  social structures and things like that um yeah story of how of that process is one
  of my favorites but I'm not going to lean into it too hard right now um but generally
  speaking chimps are very violent uh bonobos tend to solve their problems through
  gentler means um so there's kind of there's this question of like where do we really
  live like we we do like we're separated from them we're not we didn't come from
  either of them we are of the same family um so this this paragraph here uh was asking
  about like how the origins of bipedalism plays into that story of like the inherent
  violence or the not so violent life uh I'll read it in full a frequent explanation
  for the K9 reduction in bipedality so we have crappy teeth we're bad at biting um
  is that handheld weapons replaced thec which is superior K9 something or another
  uh pointy teeth pointy the handmade weapons replac the SEC but if male toale agonism
  had been fundamental to early homonid Fitness what selective agency would have reduced
  its signature character the bitey bitey teeth additional human attributes belly
  the improbability of the weapons argument the absence of sperm competition in gorillas
  and orangutans is accompanied by a dramatically reduced testes size and the elimination
  of a free scrotum their testes are more judiciously sequestered at the in a post
  penal penal bulge in contrast not only are human scotum more pendulous than those
  of the chimp than even those of the chimpanzees but bipedality makes them extraordinarily
  vulnerable during upright combat it seems illogical to attribute habitual uprightness
  to weapons that would demand even greater selection for testes sequestration that
  is then is present in other Prim AG which Target them with their functional sec's
  so the argument here is that the fact that we are bipeds with pendulus testes not
  all of us but some of us uh is argument that at this point in our Evolution the
  main determinant of our survival was not our ability to kill other bipeds and chop
  chew their parts off um so I find it this is it's so it's like the most uh what's
  the word hopeful it's like this is the Hope for humankind is our secondary pendula
  and wimpy little teeth uh anyways moving on um so arth you just missed a great part
  uh so ramidus comes along early bipad walking around still not but still AP likee
  not a not a proper um not a proper bipad um Lucy shows up and Lucy is a proper biped
  uh where's that part I missed that part um because yeah so oh yeah here's the picture
  so these are the homos these are the pan pan chitis Which is the chimps and the
  bonobos um and then this is where arpus hangs out I guess not the gorillas I guess
  Arty was a was not a gorilla uh fan um I'm going to talk about the Le fly Footprints
  before the rest of it so actually no I'm not um so these are three lower bodies
  the Bony parts of the lower bodies and this one is roughly speaking you these are
  modern humans this one here is the australopith like a afarensis that's your Lucy
  and then this is your chimpanzees your P pantog um and the thing to notice here
  is that there's there's a lot of things that are different here um the main one
  to notice to First is the pelvis um a good friend C Lovejoy said another one of
  my favorite lines which is that the human pelvis is the most phylogenically distinct
  osteological structure in the animal kingdom biogenically distinct meaning like
  evolutionarily weird osteological structure bony Chunk in the animal kingdom um
  because there's really not another analog for a creature that has a pelvis that
  looks like this the main thing to notice is it's small it's Squat and it's got these
  big swoopy Wing things these are your uh your anterior your iliac spines um this
  is different from most pelvises in the sort of Maman Kingdom at least um even outside
  where the IL are sort of more flat along the back um not that and the effects of
  this so this is a a looks like a gorilla or chimp leg with muscles and this is a
  human leg with muscles and one of the main features there is that the uh the AP
  Parts you get all this really powerful musculature for the back um and and it sort
  of but it sort of squeezes the spine in so you get these very stiff but extremely
  strong backs but you cannot stand all the way up uh so just the nature of the musculature
  means that like that's why if you see it if you look at videos of chimps and gorillas
  walking they tend to walk like this so when they they they can they can get their
  their their Center of mass over their base of support which as we know is important
  for standing and walking but they they do it by like this is tiring like I can't
  really do this for very long cuz you know the legs are bent and whatnot and so I
  have to be using my muscles to stand up here whereas we have the these Ilia are
  sort of wide open on the top so we get this sort of swoopy spine lordosis spine
  this is one of the many ways people will tell you that you're busted but this sort
  of backwards bendy spine right here um this is healthy this your lordosis is a thing
  that you need you don't want to flat back so we have two we have your cervical what's
  I forget the term but there's the the spine bends it's three times once at the neck
  around the thorax and then here around the lumbar and then our little sort of false
  tail wimpy tail things and so because we don't have those Ilia running up our backs
  we have our Ilia sort of M on the sides we get these sort of really flexible spines
  and that allows us to stand upright uh over our base of support with everything
  all lined up and so I'm not using I'm using my muscles now but only like you know
  to keep the the limbs from flopping out mostly right now I'm standing on my bones
  um so we get that from our spines or the flexibility of the spin which are freed
  up by the pelvis um and then we also because of the sort of swoopy nature on the
  outside of the pelvis we get all these great attachment points for this type of
  motion abduction so you got abduction which takes it away adduction which takes
  it towards really stupidly named uh degree of freedom but we get a lot of this so
  uh very useful again for being able to like control your body when you're standing
  on one Stumpy sort of Stumpy part uh we also get this which is called the carrying
  angle versus this which is how you would probably if you were to draw like a skeleton
  naively you would probably draw it like this you think of your your legs as coming
  straight down from your hips but we don't actually stand like that we can put our
  feet happily in line directly under our hips despite the fact that my hips are like
  45 cm wide and uh but I can happily comfortably put my feet together beneath them
  because we have this carrying angle that where our femur is sort of cut in and you
  can see that in your body is if you look if you look at your knee the inner bulb
  the inner condal is bigger like you we've known this about your knee for a long
  time it's lumpier on the inside than it is on the outside and that's so that when
  it cuts in like this it sits flat on top of the tibia which is where you're limits
  so that carrying angle is what allows us to stand with our feet directly under our
  Center of mass as we are standing upright with these weird sort of spindly behaviors
  uh very um precarious but we get pretty good at it uh the other thing we get and
  I'm going to do it now sorry uh is we get feet so we gave so you have probably at
  one point in your life wished that you could grab things with your feet you can
  a little bit but we're bad at it um but if you look at your hand there are sort
  of two main axes right you have the this grasping axis and you have this opposable
  thumb that's the the opposable side of it and because we have two axes we can move
  them relative to each other and have a whole grasping area uh and our good friends
  the Apes have that same sort of arrangement so they have the graspy feet but there's
  always going to be a trade-off so the thing that that they don't have so basically
  this this thing right here is called your big toe and fancily called your HX hux
  it is unbelievably strong relative to the rest of your body like my whole body weight
  I can just rep it on my big toe and like these little the other toes there and so
  what happened is that in the evolutionary time as we sort of stopped being AR Boral
  and we started becoming obligate bipeds uh we sort of became much more accustomed
  and acquainted to the ground and so rather than having the sort of really finely
  tunable uh sort of graspy appendages we took that strong axis and moved it in line
  with the long axis of the foot and so instead so now we don't get uh a grasping
  Dimension but because we have aligned all of the the force angles of our foot with
  the direction of locomotion we get incredibly fine uh Force control our ability
  to control the forces under our feet are is very very we are we are specialized
  at the at being able to control the forces under our feet and we we that was so
  helpful to us that we gave up the ability to grasp by just moving the thumb in line
  with the long axis of the foot so now as we are walking through the world as we
  sort of hit the ground with our heel typically and the uh the center of pressure
  moves from the back of your foot to the front of your foot you can control that
  force and that Center of pressure with with a lot of power and a lot of precision
  they'll very finely through those cortical spinal tracts and sort of all those various
  things that happen so we able to sort of manipulate those physics the center of
  pressure center of mass kind of physics that we've been talking about all semester
  because we have given up our foot grasping thumbs for this weird wacky super powerful
  halex guy right there okay sho's back on how we doing we're doing okay I knew this
  was going to take pretty much the whole time yes and so now in the spirit of so
  we're so with Nui were like sixish million years ago 6 to S million years ago um
  see grasby um I also recently like do my back out which is a thing that happens
  which is sort of like another one of the big disadvantages of the wiggly spine move
  so it's sort of like I'm here like oh look we have our flexible spines I'm like
  man like chimps don't throw their spines out like their upper back like their lats
  connect like straight to their pelvis um like roughly speaking um which is like
  that why they're they're so strong relative to us because their muscle attachments
  allow them to be um but they lose Precision um and that's true on the neural level
  for some at some level but also just at the muscular skeletal level like the structure
  of that body is just it's power not Precision um yeah so Lucy is so she's got all
  the same features that we do got our feet got our pelvis got our spine got our knee
  uh got our carrying angle we also have a carrying angle on our arms so we can they
  like they they hitch out so they sort of don't hit our pelvis um and she has that
  chimp Stone and that leads us to what's this picture this this is this is another
  one of my favorite archaeological finds in history these are the Lei Footprints
  um they were also found in the old Divi Gorge or near the old Divi Gorge um in Tanzania
  and they represent a region of footprints from about 4 million years ago and they
  cor there's roughly 70 Footprints in that region uh Le toi toi and and it was basically
  a it was some area where there was some some event happened some uh volcanic event
  or just rain event or something like that so there was this layer of like chuff
  I think they call it with just like like strange wet mud and during a particular
  sort of state of that mud uh I think they said I think it's three hominids walked
  across that mud two big ones and one small one and if you believe the sort of poetic
  stories it's a family if you are less into that we really don't have a good way
  to know but there's two big ones and two there's two big ones and a small one and
  at one point in the walk the small one starts walking in the footprints of the big
  one and 4 million years ago and they have and and so they do a lot of analyses of
  like the squish patterns under of the of the so they walked across and then something
  else happened and this got covered and the footprints fossilized and then later
  on some uh European colonizer found them and uh was wrote them down so they were
  discovered uh and then like they they took scans they took cast they took all sorts
  of stuff and then they reburied them because they were not they couldn't take them
  out of the ground um so they they they marked them they took a bunch of measurements
  took a bunch of casts and then put the dirt back over them again uh because they
  didn't want to remove them from the ground and they also didn't want it to be like
  a tourist attraction because they didn't want it to get ruined so these are still
  hanging out somewhere out near Old The Gorge Tanzania uh just being what they are
  um and so if they look at the so this is a a chimp walking um their back the back
  foot of a chimp and you can see like that a posable foot and the footprints that
  you see in the Lei uh Footprints was someone that used heel toe walking so rather
  than doing like the sort of the whatever they do um they were walking heel to toe
  and sort of the center of pressure moving along the long axis of their foot being
  controlled by this powerful HX and 4 million years ago three guys three folks walked
  across a muddy field and now we can see them and we can think about why was there
  why were there two big ones and one small one and why did the small one walk in
  the footprints of the big one it seems like something I might do if I was in a muddy
  field with someone else uh if you ever gone you walk through snow that's how we
  do with through snow um and this guy wasn't us they were not Arty was not us she
  was a different cousin friend she was was a chimp she is no more close to us than
  than a chimpanze would be um but you know we are related so yeah so then we hung
  out and so so now we're in we're on our Branch now of the tree there's no one else
  on this Branch but us no one else remaining on this Branch but us um and there's
  a couple extra steps in here so you get Homo erectus which I think I think Homo
  erectus was called that they were also a good biped and I think but then like we
  discovered Lucy later and she was like a better like biped and so um not homo but
  she's a tropicus get I don't really the distinctions there get murky for me um but
  then we get Homo habilis uh Tulio not really no one no one called him that but I
  think it's funny um homohabilis people like to say is the origin of tool use um
  but we don't really know obviously uh so the the actual first tool user in our lineage
  is somewhere in this range and we know that largely by just what they left behind
  so mostly that comes in the form of stone tools but if you think about like if you're
  out in the woods what's the first thing you pick up it's not necessarily a rock
  it's like a stick uh and if you're going out and you're killing animals you might
  wear their fur you might do stuff like that none of that's going to leave a fossil
  in the same way that that a good rock will um so a lot of the early evidence that
  we have for Tool use comes from the form of stone tools and there was a really great
  talk that I saw once um from someone whose name I don't remember couldn't fig couldn't
  find of looking at because we have a ton of uh of of evidence of these stone tools
  because these are literal rocks we don't have to wait for some like fancy special
  uh like fossilization event it's just a rock so you can start looking for box that
  are basically like uh stone tools that are in places that you wouldn't expect uh
  old stone tools um yeah actually I think it might have been I think the author of
  this paper might be the guy I'm thinking about because I think this is what this
  is about um but so the origin of these tools and evolution of these tools um fit
  a particular kind of there was also an evolution that happened there the first stone
  tools were just kind of like good rock and they would find they would find rocks
  in places that they really shouldn't be and they would have wear patterns on them
  that they really shouldn't have uh through natural processes and it's seems like
  someone's like I like this Rock I'm going to carry this Rock With Me Do they have
  a bag to put it in probably not the first ones but eventually they probably did
  and the bag didn't stick around but the rock probably did and the first actually
  and probably before that so that's that's the hand axe era of human tool use and
  that was most of our evolutionary history was hand axes um they would also find
  these flakes so something else that they would do is they would find particular
  rocks um and they learned which rocks would shatter well and they would after after
  they would hunt and kill something they would find these rocks they would just smash
  them on the ground and pick up the sharp parts and use that to do the carving um
  so they weren't really shaping the Rocks they were just smashing and sort of like
  picking through the rest of the good stuff and as you sort of go through the history
  here I'm guessing about what this paper is but you can see that they sort of the
  the tools become more and more sophisticated over the course of like millions of
  years Aon types of time time periods and it starts from just like this is a good
  rock and it goes to these like these are good rock flakes you would find rock flakes
  near where you would find like evidence of some hunting and then you would start
  to get get like more and more advanced sort of uh tools which require which would
  have required more and more advanced cognitive abilities until you get to like the
  latter Parts like of the you know the stuff that we we still till use today in some
  some sort of areas uh the most modern form of stone tool use where you would get
  these very very complex things where in order to make that type of a tool you can't
  just smash the rock you can't just smash the Rock and hope that it comes out sharp
  you have to like shape it in a particular way and then once it's ready one big smack
  would sort of would Shear off the whole thing and then you could start that's how
  you would form these like really perfectly shaped things and so the paper if this
  is the one that it is was the guy learning how to do that type of technique and
  realizing that once you get to a certain area you're no longer doing like a stimulus
  response thing like you're planning ahead like you're you're you're you're doing
  this this this this this this this this this this this this okay now it's ready
  and then one big smack to get it to Shear off in their nice carvable blade and so
  there's this interesting story of the evolution of our cognitive capacity that gets
  told through the complexity of the stone tools that we find scattered along the
  way and again just I think it's worth making the point again if you were doing this
  you're almost certainly doing other stuff too you almost certainly have cool sticks
  and cool rocks and wearing Furs I I can't imagine being able to do some of this
  without also noticing like hey that I just killed that tiger and it's got a lot
  of fur and I'm cold I think I'm going to figure out how to do that like these are
  at this point they're still not like proper humans but they're smart and so they're
  probably doing stuff if they were painting themselves if they were doing something
  resembling art we find cave art and stuff like that uh our ability to know that
  is lost because those things don't leave evidence um yeah and then you get this
  yeah a cacophony of homos uh which is not the proper term for that but that's the
  time to just get all of these homos homo homo habilis homo rudolfensis homo the
  be blah blah blah homo orter um they're overlapping with some of the aalines hom
  erectus homeli that's the ones we found in that cave uh homo hadab orinus this is
  one they call I think I think that's the one they call The Hobbit like it's little
  guy homon neander Talis and then Homo sapiens this one's us um but also some of
  these guys seems like there's some some mix there there were a bunch of them it's
  a it's a pretty good body type and it's it was very effective and there were a bunch
  of there's a bunch of homos running around the uh Eurasian continent for a good
  long time and then they died some somehow or another they all just died out except
  for us there were certainly some Extinction events uh there were some pretty narrow
  bottlenecks at some point where they say like down to like like 25,000 some odd
  uh breeding pairs of whatnot um uh but for some reason we don't really know we're
  the only ones left um a lot of them died off we might have killed some of them we
  probably interbred with neander tals um we all have some percentage of the andal
  DNA if you're like wait I thought different species couldn't breed together it's
  like well that's speciation is kind of complicated in murky so we don't really know
  um but we do know that it's just us left um the bipedal hand wielding sort of thing
  you know it condense down to this um the questions of why Homo sapiens one out one
  out why there's Homo sapiens there's not home in ANS because they were we lived
  at the same time as these guys um these guys were bigger than us uh they had bigger
  brains um not necessarily bigger brain to body ratio but bigger brains um and it's
  thought that kind of like we were smaller so we survived ice ages better um or we
  just kind of like we overlap and then just interbred and there was just more of
  us so they like the spe we stopped finding distinct ones of these and start finding
  mixed ones of those um who knows uh and yeah and then that's the question marks
  who knows like we hard hard to know how weite got there um so yeah so here we are
  now we're these bubble-headed soft tooth kindhearted jog monsters is kind of one
  of the things there uh there's a lot of evidence around the early Homo sapiens that
  we were we started becoming nice in some way shape and form like we find skeletons
  of of humans that had like like bone disorders that would have been basically like
  immobile their entire life uh so if they lived to be the age that we that they were
  when we found them there was somebody taking care of them that entire time we find
  burials of of skeletons with like really valuable really well-carved stone tools
  in the grave with them so somebody loved this person enough to give up a very valuable
  tool when they when they walked away from it and there also of other stuff like
  we like uh one of our many superpowers is that we have like a healing Factor relative
  to other animals we heal much better than most creatures um and evidence for that
  from like these skeletons were like they were busted up like a lot of these old
  school humans like they broke their bones all the time and so you find these evidence
  of like uh bones that broke and then reheal and during that time that person was
  useless they were not contributing to the group while they were healing from an
  injury at that scale so somebody was taking care of them so even though we were
  horrifying creatures like we dominated the landscape by basically being able to
  jog indefinitely it's kind of one of our things is we just we like show up and the
  deer Sprints and we Jog and we learn how to throw this was a power move big problem
  for the world because it's like you're over there but I have like these like like
  this very mobile powerful dextrous joint coupled to a very precisely accurate visual
  system so if I I all I have to do is get close enough to the deer to hit it with
  a rock and then it Sprints off and then I jog after it and then I get close enough
  to hit it with another rock and it doesn't take very long before that deer stops
  being able to Sprint away and I just keep on jogging in I just it's horrifying uh
  persistence hunting if you want to look that up um yeah and that's uh is there anything
  else to say there yes so yeah and so also want to mention about the so we have so
  the skull the skull is important the skull is an important part um right on the
  top there and the thing that was mentioned in that oh gorilla skull so humans are
  considered to be very weakly sexually dimorphic uh meaning that the differences
  in body between male female subtypes are is is is very limited we are super tuned
  to it so it looks big for us but on the sort of Zoological scale basically the same
  um gorillas not that way uh and I wanted to and so male female this is more just
  this is not uh something I forgot to say earlier but uh yeah so this is the male
  gorilla that's the female gorilla smaller and sort of smoother head but the thing
  I really want to point out is this this is called the sagittal Crest and this is
  this is present in a lot of animals especially like the bitey bitey ones um and
  it's basically an attachment point for the jaw muscles so for a gorilla they have
  that pointy head uh and other animals have this too if you have a dog feel on their
  head they'll have a sagittal Crest um cats have kind of a pretty wimpy one but it's
  basically an attachment point so the jaw muscles go from here through the cheekbones
  and attach up top there and so this is sort of part of our uh our wimpy wimpy bite
  is that we we gave a lot of that up so if you find your jaw muscles here so like
  on the edge of your jaw and like squeeze your teeth you can find your jaw muscles
  it goes up through like under the cheekbones and then if you put your hands kind
  of on your temples here and bite again you'll find where the the where they attach
  take that part and kind of push it together don't do it in reality but imagine doing
  it and where that meets is going to be something like that uh and so we suck at
  biting relative to other animals like don't bite anybody I mean follow your heart
  but don't if you if you had to choose between getting bit by a person or getting
  CH bit by a chimpanzee person all day um because we gave up a lot of that real estate
  to have those muscle attachment points now cuz if in the same way that you can imagine
  pushing those muscle points those muscle ATT those jaw muscle attachment points
  together into something like a sagittal crust now imagine poofing this part out
  so this uh this sort of brain part there the brain part if you're the details um
  right here just sort of blow up that bubble and that's basically what we that's
  basically what happened for us and so we we got a lot of extra real estate in the
  the dome for our weird lumpy dense complicated brain uh and but by doing so we gave
  up a lot of that real estate for being able to bite so back to that sort of story
  about the pendulous of our forbears um that was sort of part of the question is
  like at some point we stopped being good like sort of like raw like like our ability
  to like kill each other with our bare bodies got worse and so this question of like
  what happened in that in that region so there so love joy talks about the the weapons
  hypothesis which is like we didn't need the teeth anymore because we had the weapons
  then he's like but that that story actually doesn't really track because of the
  pendulous argument and so what we get to what's a pretty decent end of this weird
  story which is that it seems that the actual thing that we developed which allowed
  us to dominate allowed us to kill much pointier animals and be the thing that is
  sort of everywhere and sort of learns how to go to space and learns what stars are
  and things like that was our ability to be kind social animals like we we worked
  together with people we took care of them when they were ill um and we let them
  walk in our footprints when we had to and that's sort of the story of how we got
  here and yeah that's about okay that's about that I think that's about the story
  that's human evolution in a nutshell um got six minutes left does anybody have any
  questions I know this is like in a lecture that typically doesn't have like Q&A
  like asking people for questions it's like no one's ever going to do it but just
  pretend like I'm an AI like what imagine like what would you have typed into the
  chat bot and just find your heart and say it which part of that story sounds sus
  to you yeah so yeah so the what was the equation you said lever equation yeah um
  it's it's complicated is the is the answer um so like the attachment points and
  The Leverage that you get from that is absolutely going to be a part of that um
  so just like the nature of like you know if you're pulling from here down to there
  that's going to be stronger than if you're pulling kind of around the corner there
  um but there's other stuff too like uh one of the things I really like is the um
  this is like by the way how Q&A happens in scientific context you just wait for
  someone to ask a question it reminds you something you wanted to talk about um chimp
  hands so they have so like our tendons are fairly uh stretchy and thin um which
  gives us more Dexter Dex dexterity there uh chimps have they're they are the resting
  state of our hand is this like our our with our fingers straight um chimps and a
  lot of the other like tree climbing animals their resting state is like that because
  their their um their what's the tendons are thicker and shorter um and so when they're
  when they hang out they hang out like this and so if you're if you're grasping from
  that perspective it's going to be stronger because like the the rubber bands attached
  to it are thicker um and it's another so they have very very strong grip um but
  they lose some of that Precision there's also some evidence I've heard suggesting
  about like um the distribution this is getting this is now more Neuroscience like
  like something about the distribution of like motor units in their muscles um we
  have lots and lots and lots of motor units like spread throughout our muscles particularly
  in our hands and things like that and when we are activating our a particular joint
  we do so by basically firing one of those motor units in the muscle um and so we
  because we have so many we have the ability to like do a gradient of that so we
  don't fire them all at the same time which gives us the ability to make small subtle
  movements my understanding is that chimps and things like that it's much more All
  or Nothing so they they I think it's like kind of I might be getting this wrong
  but I think it's um what's the word uh counterintuitively they have like fewer motor
  units because when they when they say grasp they're they're they're always going
  to be grasping with close to their full strength whereas we have the ability to
  have more gradient control so there is the The Leverage aspect of just where the
  muscle attachments are there's also like the the complexity of like the the tendons
  and stuff like that and there's arguably possibly something going on at the level
  of the nervous system like cortical spinal tract kind of stuff where it's like we
  have the ability to make our muscles do more fine grained movements which has a
  trade-off to being able to do like full power things cuz also it's like if you're
  always going full bore with every movement then you're also going to develop more
  hypertrophic muscles over the course of your life so there's this kind of like there's
  the leverage there's the M there's the actual muscular tendon stuff there's the
  neural structure and there's like the lifetime of being a creature with this type
  of thing like where does the actual strength come from so it's always going to be
  this kind of like overlapping kind of weird story there um was there something else
  I wanted to say on that probably uh yeah okay thank you for the question uh I I
  always like to point out this just because it's like it's literally just they have
  shorter thicker tendons and so they're better at this which is good because they
  live that life um so yeah there's this whole like the interplay between like the
  muscular skeletal structure and the neural controller and the and the lifetime of
  experience and like it's always everything all at once um yeah and that's the class
  so so thank you thanks for showing up

    of the #evolution of #human #movement, beginning with the #bigbang  and progressing
    through the formation of elements, planets, and the emergence of #life. It traces
    the development of self-replicating molecules like #RNA, leading to evolution
    and the diversification of life forms during the #CambrianExplosion. The evolution
    of vertebrates, including the transition from aquatic to #terrestrial life, is
    discussed, along with the development of #primates and the anatomical adaptations
    for #bipedalism. The lecture highlights the evolution of #tooluse and #cognitive
    abilities in early #Homo species, culminating in the emergence of #Homosapiens
    and the importance of social cooperation in human evolutions'

  text: okay all right hello everybody uh welcome to this world um yeah so today we're
    going to talk about uh Evolution which is a big topic lot going on and we're kind
    of going to what's the word um speedrun through a lot of details and then we're
    eventually going to get to the part that's sort of more directly related to like
    the human movement part so arguably this is about the evolution of human movement
    um I no AI updates I'm working on some stuff but nothing that has actually produced
    uh something sharable so we'll get there um I next week or the week after we'll
    figure it out um yes let's go ahead and feel like there's more to say at the beginning
    is there anything to say semester is coming to an end there is a sort of two or
    three four classes left no one knows maybe three after this after this I think
    it's like either three or four but um next week Thanksgiving week yeah Thanksgiving
    week is going to be kind of like a fake week cuz I I I'll do stuff um that will
    be relevant but I know how I know how this goes um so I'll try to make that non
    essential not that any this is um so maybe next week will be the one where I talk
    about my actual research because I think this is the hypothetically like the not
    not the culmination but like I think once I'm done with this stuff you will have
    at least hypothetically sufficient background um well I will have sufficient I
    will have said sufficient background to be able to talk about my research with
    at least not most of it being completely new um so we'll see we'll figure it out
    um y'all just show up and try not to fall asleep um but if you do I understand
    you're tired um okay so starting from the beginning Big Bang Boom Universe explodes
    that's kind of where we start from so the Big Bang is our current culturally preferred
    creation myth um it is like all good creation stories it explains a lot but it
    doesn't explain everything um the Japanese at one point in their history thought
    that Japan was formed by a giant sword stabbed in then the droplets makes uh where
    the drops fell that's where the islands fell doesn't explain a ton but it does
    explain why the islands are the way that they are um the Genesis 11 vision of
    of the world is that God made light cuz it

  text: was dark and then he like made a bubble cuz the ancient Hebrews thought that
    we were in like an infinite ocean so he made firmament for the ground and then
    thick stars for the top and then that's where we lived and then people eventually
    were like wait but there's all these like the fixed Stars don't move but there's
    these ones that do move those are probably planets so let's make maybe we're in
    spheres and so the planets are the Spheres and the outer sphere is the fixed stars
    and then Galileo invented the telescope and looked at I was like wait there's
    something orbiting that one too so maybe we're orbiting the Sun and then eventually
    we sort of got better and better telescopes got better and better data we started
    noticing weird things like the universe is expanding that's strange things every
    everywhere we look things are moving away from us and if you're like if you think
    about yourself as a as like a dot in a grid on the outside of a balloon everywhere
    you would look things would be expanding so Hubble looking around not the guy
    but the telescope um saw that kind of stuff happening we we invented things called
    radio telescopes we saw this thing called the background radiation and if you
    extrapolate all those things out then if you sort of play the clock back then
    about 12 billion years ago or so everything is going to be in the same place and
    what comes before that well we don't really know what comes after that everything
    that we do know or not really what comes before that we don't know slash within
    this cosmology there's no way to discuss that question um and so the Big Bang
    explains a lot um but it doesn't explain everything for example if it if that
    if it was just that simple big boom story where we would look things would be
    slowing down they're not they're speeding up if we had a good sense of where the
    energy lived in the world we could look at galaxies and predict their speed we
    can't we're off by like 70% and we call the difference Dark Energy um so we know
    that this cosmology is not like true but we believe that it is more true than
    the previous things because it helps us make better and more precise predictions
    that's Carl Popper's long and short of philosophy of science and we'll go with
    it for now so big bang explodes um all the energy and all the universe of all
    time is created in that moment so we say remember when people talk about um things
    like the uh what's it called conservation of energy that's the energy that they're
    talking about and the thought is that there was a bunch of something something
    happened there was a bunch of matter a bunch of antimatter it obliterated itself
    and the obliterated matter anti matter became all the energy in the universe mostly
    in the form of Light which is just part of the electromagnetic spectrum and for
    some strange reason when that thing happened there was some left over there was
    some matter left over and if you're curious about that Emily N is a physicist
    of old back lady scientist before that was okay

  text: um who T who looked at symmetry breaking math in physics so the question of
    why there's anything left over that's what she's talking that's who knows but
    here we are so there was clearly something left that did not obliterate itself
    and that's roughly the stuff that we're standing on so big explosion 12 billion
    years ago uh and for a good little while everything is too hot to do anything
    useful um as the universe expands the gasses cool down and things start to form
    shapes your positrons and your electrons and all your quirks and nonsense sort
    of started showing up eventually it gets bigger that stuff cools down even further
    and you get things like protons and electrons they meet up and become hydrogen
    and this is where we start getting closer to biology hydrogen good start so those
    hang out in the form of nebula which are big cloudlike things uh and they're made
    out of matter matter has gravity so that you get a big cloud it's going to start
    to condense on itself so the clouds start to condense until eventually they get
    so smooshed in that they get super hot and the hydrogen fuses into helium it's
    called Fusion because it fuses together hydrogen into helium is a super energetic
    explosion um and so it fights against the collapsing gravity of the nebula and
    explodes outwards and that sort of equilibrium of explosion and collapsing is
    what we call Stars uh that is also the origin of our good friend helium not particularly
    useful in biology that's you get one hydrogen one hydrogen put them together you
    get two atomic weight that's helium so for a good while that's all we got to just
    a bunch of hydrogen nebula fusing into stars that are burning hydrogen to get
    helium and then that goes on for a while until some of the Stars start to burn
    out all of their hydrogen and are left with nothing but helium when they when
    that process stops the helium stars now collapse um because it takes more energy
    to fuse helium that it does to fuel Hy fuse hydrogen but they collapse so hard
    that they get so hot that it fuses into like burum or something like that um which
    is a less energetic process but it's enough to fight the the collapse and you
    get a new type of stars that process continues they burn through their subsequent
    elements and you get basically all the chemistry that we need for regular old
    biology the top row on the periodic table uh what's it called periodic table Yeah
    you got your hydrogen you got your helium you got your lithium you got your burum
    and you got these are all of our very good friends here once you get to oxygen
    you start getting a ton of water

  text: hydrogen plus oxygen equals water it's one of the most common things in the
    universe and that process of the stars burning through their fuel and doing Fusion
    on in less and less efficient methods works all the way up until about iron and
    once you get to iron and you start trying to do Fusion on iron that process is
    not strong enough to produce the explosive force you need to stop the collapsing
    of the star and then the star collapses all the way way and for some stars that
    are big enough they do this kind of wacky thing where as they're collapsing they
    hit that Fusion point for the later stuff and it sort of but just kind of like
    like slam slam slam and then eventually explode in the form of supernova and whereas
    the first part can take millions and millions and millions and millions of years
    that last part of this the Supernova part takes like 2 weeks which is up um but
    anyways that's where all the rest of this stuff comes from and that's how all
    of this stuff gets out into the universe so now we've got a universe with elements
    in it those elements continue to cool down till eventually they form these accretion
    discs and the and the some of the accretion sort of silicates or this first silicone
    this silicone um forms rocky planets uh we live on one of those rocky planets
    the ground is from those Stars so whenever you hear people say like oh we're made
    of star dust star stuff stard dust that's what they're talking about so yeah and
    so that's so that's step one that's how you get planets planets are very important
    for evolution um probably uh they're at least in in one case a sufficient condition
    so you get solar systems solar system have planets some of them are big gas giants
    like your Jupiter's and your Neptunes some of them are small rocky sort of chunks
    uh like Earth and Mars and those and folks like that for the majority of Earth's
    existence it was not habitable to anything at all it was it's hot it's magma it's
    very sort of uh it's hot magma and it's got no atmosphere so it's getting hit
    by solar radiation bad time bad news um nothing really um no complex chemistry
    can really show up in that space cuz it's too violent um but if you recall there's
    a lot of water in the world a lot of water in the universe hydrogen is the first
    guy on the show oxygen is not far after and there are some Stellar bodies out
    there that just do nothing but spit out a trillion times the amount of water on
    Earth every second for a billion years if you go flying around this flying around
    in space you're going to find a lot of

  text: rocks of water ice eventually the Earth sort of clears out its orbit because
    it's all the parts just Clump up together um so you get less meteorite impacts
    which is good for Life uh and you also get a lot of water because a lot of those
    chunks are chunks of ice and so you start to get things like oceans oceans are
    super useful things for life because they're water so they if they're liquid water
    then they temperature range is sort of like reasonable um and they're also very
    good at blocking radiation so we have we live on the surface of our planet so
    we mostly rely on air of various forms to block our radiation along with our Earth's
    magnetic field does a pretty good job with the solar wind another great solution
    is you don't have a good atmosphere is live underwater um and so if you're curious
    about not I don't nothing follow up here but like there places in most of the
    water in the solar system is not on Earth it is on a combination of moons the
    Jovi and moons Enceladus uh Europa these are ice moons that have a thick sheath
    of ice and beneath that sheath of ice we have recently discovered we have geologically
    active planets and warm water oceans um so who knows what's hanging out in there
    um anyway so here we are on earth it's hot it's bad there a lot of radiation but
    we've got oceans and so once we get into the oceans we can start to form various
    goop goop is a good precursor to life I don't know much about this I'm sure there's
    much more that can be said about the specifics of this goop but at some point
    the goop becomes fancy goop uh and the fancy goop is I'm going to say roughly
    speaking RNA uh uh ribonucleic acid mRNA uh I guess it's not an M because it's
    not got nothing to message but RNA is a very important type of goop because it
    is self-replicating self-replication like just the nature of the orientation of
    the who's itss and the what's itss the hexagons and sticks and the carbons and
    the hydrogens that came from the Stars it makes copies of itself wild move how
    we got the goop we kind of understand it's just stuff gops up like some a lot
    of the nebula that are out there are like literally ethanol like you could go
    scoop some up and drink it and get drunk like like fancy chemistry is not hard
    to find um and you put it together it gets goop that thing where it becomes the
    self-replicating molecule who knows it could just be a numbers game like you just
    let it hang out for long enough um in a place that is protected from radiation
    and meteors and too hot of temperatures and things like that and you just get
    things like RNA who knows I

  text: don't but I know that that in at least one case it is possible to happen at
    least one time and that is called the anthropic principle uh which is the concept
    that we know that the universe is capable of creating supporting life because
    if it wasn't then I wouldn't really be able to ask the question so in at least
    one at least one case at least one time at least one planet that roughly resembles
    this one it is possible for something like RNA to emerge and once you have something
    like RNA the process of evolution and begin because when you have uh something
    that replicates it will replicate imperfectly um and so you start and that starts
    off this kind of genetic algorithm uh which is a fun thing to Google it's like
    a that's genetic algorithms are kind of a computer science term but they're based
    off of basic Evolution the idea is that if you have something self-replicating
    and it's self-replicating with variation some of those variations will be better
    at surviving than other of those variations and if the if the mutations are heritable
    then that process kicks off a pretty interesting cascade of events uh leading
    up to and including this moment right now the so you start from so so now you've
    got self-replicating mrnas eventually they form into things which we what we might
    call cells um I will show a animation in in a second but we'll go through this
    with words for now cells are basically a shell it's you have a you make a membrane
    lipid Bator if you're into that kind of stuff and now you have invented something
    very interesting in the history of life and that is an inside and an outside there's
    a there's a part that is sequestered from the rest of the universe and it has
    its own sort of situation going on on the inside which is separated from the outside
    which is everything you are also one of these types of thing the cells are pretty
    lame for a while it's like ARA which I don't they don't even have they don't have
    organel they just kind of like float around um this might somewhere in this process
    you get light sensitivity that's where eventually we we that's eventually this
    kind of stuff light sensitivity once you start having things that have inside
    and outside you might say they have a sense they that's a that's an organism um
    and that organism at some point will start developing the ability to sense the
    environment if absorb some environmental energy convert it into some internal
    State and then at some other point put Force into the world that will allow it
    to change its position relative to everything else hemo sensation is thought to
    be the first sense that smell the ability to sense chemical gradients it's like
    hey there's food in this direction I'm going to go there there oh that's poison

  text: going to go this way that's smell chemo sensation at some other point um light
    is also light sensitivity is somewhere on the list of Senses we picked up and
    it's thought that the the first origins of light sensitivity was in like Plankton
    like objects that might want to go up when the Sun is up and go down when the
    sun is down so all you need to do is know is to have something in your body that
    absorbs photon and have some other chemical process that moves in the direction
    of that thing or maybe you're in the water so you don't even go in the direction
    of light you just go up who knows um this is now at some point here we also develop
    directionality you have forward that's a good useful thing we we we started with
    inside we started with everything then we have inside now we have forward um Good
    Start uh we get better cells we Aras and your basic bacterium sort of that the
    majority of life is is that we're mostly just hanging out single C or we're mostly
    just hanging out as like hydrogen and whatnot but for the parts that we have been
    living beings mostly it's in the sort of bacterial archa um simple cell type of
    Lifestyle eventually it is thought that cells fig fig out how to eat each other
    and then once some guy some guy ate some other guy and the other guy that got
    ate was like I'm not going to die I'm just going to become organel and that's
    how you get UK carots the biology majors in the room are having which is all of
    you may have opinions on that story but that's roughly speaking what is what I
    believe happened um eventually these cells start to Clump together you get multicellular
    life this is another great move it probably started with just like mats and then
    kind of sort of simple things like sponges which have the like the the line between
    bacterial eukariotic colony and multicellular life sort of murky as all this stuff
    is um at some point well between here and here things start to um develop another

    basically just like a tube uh you're not yet you're not yet a tube um around this

    at the bottom of the ocean um this is has the advantage of being underwater so

  text: plumes are hot and there's Al and also near weird chemistry because the geothermal
    plumes are spitting out weird stuff from the center of the earth and so it's a
    so it's a pretty good move to just sort of anchor yourself to the spots near the
    plumes and just be a weird sort of worm like creature which again is why I think
    it's really cool that when they flew they found plumes coming off of Europa big
    geysers and they flew Cassini or something through the plumes and smelled the
    mist and found uh things like methane um which is a kind of thing that life makes
    but not mshell so on Europa there is at the beneath a crust of ice and a warm
    water ocean there is there are things like geothermal events spewing complex chemistry
    into space but that's not important right now some other point someone else made
    a very I think uh super important Discovery uh more of an organizational principle
    which is to have two holes one for in and one for out that was a great move that
    I think we're all very grateful for that's roughly where we still are basically
    aside from all the details you're all tubes with a bunch of weird stuff around
    it and everything is sort of organized around that sort of central tube uh that
    goes in and out and that is the origin of worms good friends worms folks like
    sea elegans there's a lot of worm people in this department um biology has often
    study of worms um and then once you get to a particular worm named C elegans I
    don't think this is how this happened evolutionarily but you get such a thing
    as a nervous system nervous systems have neurons neurons are cells that Spike
    um and I don't really have time to get into all the details there if talk about
    it some Point probably heard about it at some point nerves very good useful things
    um C Elegance has 302 uh which is the smallest complete nervous system that we're
    aware of um I don't know how old they are but they've been around for a while
    eventually you moving on from there you get to another great point in time which
    is sort of internal structure so you start getting I mean I don't the details
    get I don't know the details here but like you get uh your gastropods you get
    your slugs and you get your worms and eventually you get your Cordata which is
    roughly speaking things with a spine um that's your uh you also have like your
    mollusk and your clams and probably crabs at some point too ex exoskeleton types
    they're great but they're not us so we can sort of Branch off from them uh uh

    of something else which is way less chill which is predation someone figured out
    that if I if I can just sit around making my own body my whole life it's very
    very hard very expensive if I just eat you then I can get all the energy that
    you've been growing your whole life and then I don't have to do that and somewhere
    in there you get the inent sort of the development of the Predator prey sort of
    arms race and that is thought to be a major driver of evolution because if all
    you're doing is sitting around sucking weird chemistry out of geothermal vents
    there's not a lot of pressure to really be the biggest worm on the Block but if
    the biggest worm on the Block starts trying to eat you now you got to start try
    to figure out how to deal with that situation and that is sort of roughly speaking
    thought to be what we call the Cambrian explosion which was a time the Cambrian
    Period where you just start seeing a whole ton of weird life showing up you start
    seeing all sorts of much more speciated uh much more advanced sort of organisms
    growing up showing up and at some point in that process you get the bony fish
    which oh I did shut this down that's too bad um so oh look a paper let's pretend
    I'm not on campus one of the of the many ways that you are that the harms of this
    places like this are are hidden from you is that when you're on campus papers
    just show up if you're off campus it's like pay $40 to get this paper so even

    pairing um so he goes this paper goes through and looks at these look familiar
    to you so these are IM movements these are head movements then you take head plus
    I and you get gaze which has these sort of stable moments out in the world that's
    for that's for the author's left eye looking around a room this is the kind of
    papers you get to write if you're doing stuff like that then he Compares this
    to other guys so these are a goldfish making a turn these are head movement a
    rabbit tracking something uh birds are interesting for a lot of reasons but not
    the least of which that their eyes are an appreciable percentage of the weight
    of their head um so we stabilize our gaze by having our big honken heavy heads
    and our thick short stiff necks move our head around and we stabilize our gaze
    at the eye level birds have very long and flexible necks so they stabilize their
    gaze at the head level but they can't really make much eye movements but they
    still have that sort of same like sacot and fixate style of gaze it's just happening
    at the level of their heads you ever look up those videos people like moving a
    chicken around and the head stays fixed it's V at the head level it's a vestibulo
    colic reflex colic for head this is a chameleon this is a rock crab this is a
    stock eyed fly and they're all kind of doing the same sort of thing because they're
    all using the same opsins the same basic chemistry the chemicals that respond
    to photons and light they're all using the same basic chemistry there and they're
    all and that opson operate in roughly the same way which is that they respond
    to light they're very useful as these sort of biological light sensors but they're
    relatively slow like they move takes some 10 of milliseconds for them to respond
    to light and then some tens of milliseconds for them for the light for them to
    like reset um which if you look at a bright light in a loal way that after effect
    is because your opos in that part of your retina haven't reset yet so land argues
    that this Coten fixate strategy is absolutely just like a it's a fundamental aspect
    of having a good visual system so he argues and and so and he argues by talking
    about this guy walls uh who wrote a paper in 1962 which I tried to read I tried
    to read it's just like it's it's like that old style so it's just very very long
    with like no pictures so I I trust mikeland to have told me that the argument
    there is that we have evidence for the origin of eye movements uh stretching back

    each one of these Rings is like time goes outward from this space and so you start
    with these bacteria and these ARA and these UK carots plants show up plants are
    useful we eat those they're great they they uh eventually turn the atmosphere
    into oxygen which causes a climate catastrophe and things poison themselves because
    oxygen is like really intense but we get over that um there's also a period of
    time in our history called the Carboniferous period which is the space between
    the evolution of plants and the evolution of fungi which is basically a period
    of life on Earth where plants are out here specifically Woody plants are out here
    making cellulose which is really hardcore like chemically bonded and when they
    when then they die there's nothing on the planet that knows how to break those
    cellulose bonds so all the plants that die just hang out on the ground and they
    turn into things like petrified wood um they burn there was apparently like like
    like wildfires that were the size of continents because forests would just die
    and just never go anywhere um they also turn into all fossil fuels the all the
    fossil fuels on the planet these like repositories of like rarified carbon change
    hydrocarbon change and oil and coal and stuff like that is from that this Gap
    period here um and it's typically things like bogs and swamps and stuff like that
    because it the the plant matter would die but it wouldn't be broken up and sort
    of get back into the sort of ecosystem it would sort of sequester there so you
    know fossil fuel super useful you can do a lot of stuff with it some problems
    with using it too much too fast uh we'll see how that goes um but then eventually
    fungi show up and they learn how and they know how to eat cellulose and so the
    Carboniferous furi ends and now trees can rot and go back into the carbon cycle

    yeah there was ice ages it's fine um mass extinction events there's a bunch of
    Max mass extinctions but it's okay right around here this is your these are your
    bony fish these are these are the first guys that made eye movements uh presumably
    it could be that some of the other guys did too but there's also this issue where
    uh bones make fossils shells make fossils slugs don't make good fossils so there
    were probably guys there's eye stocks and things like that but bony fish have
    a skeleton bony fish have a spine bony fish have muscles and those muscles are
    attached to eyeballs and so eye movements roughly around here doing great biologically
    at some point we decide that we don't like the ocean anymore it's too crowded
    people keep eating us they have weird mouths so someone decides to crawl out onto
    the land um that guy was basically like a sort of a mud skipper type of fish hang
    thought to be they would go out lay eggs go back in and that keeps your eggs from
    getting eaten cuz the only thing on the on the ground is are these plants hanging
    out and they don't eat any anybody they're chill they just suck up light and do
    the KB cycle which is super inefficient but it works um eventually the guys decide
    that they like going out onto land and they uh get their flippers become hands
    and their back flippers become feet and they're crawling around and they're basically
    they're lizard-like guys this is the worth of tetrapod these are the first tetrapods
    tetrapods are roughly this shape head torso upper arms lower lower limbs uh tail

    you get your birds um birds have been birds are basically the first bipeds they
    beat us to the punch there like by like 200 million years they are better at bipeds
    than better at bipedalism than we are spent a lot of time in grad school arguing
    the opposite I have come to terms with the fact that 200 million years of evolution
    makes you makes you good at having two feet they have like the very short femur
    very long shank and then the sort of like uh like whatever the name of that sort

    sort of quadrupedal dinosaurs they hang out for a good long time uh eventually
    you get um where is it probably roughly one of these mass extinctions comes along
    uh you get such things as the Gulf of Mexico as a result and all the dinosaurs
    tend to die off um or become Birds that's their those are their options and a
    lot of them chose death and some of them chose bird and we are grateful to we
    we trust them to make those decisions for themselves now amongst the little crawly
    boys uh some of them were developing things like fur and warm blood um the first
    mammals were basically tree shrew looking things sort of like squirrel like guys
    hanging out in trees AR Boreal they hang out in trees they run around on branches
    now this is a great move for us eventually because if you're hanging out on branches
    then you're going to need to have grasping because the trees are very thin um
    and so as these guys are running around the tops of trees trying to avoid getting
    eaten by dinosaurs they're small so they don't need much food they're warm blood
    flooded so they're more they're more uh resilient to to sort of massive climate
    upheavals and in the as in as the dinosaurs are all dying because of the because
    of the invention of the Gulf of Mexico uh these guys are doing just great um and
    so as they start they're running around in the trees with their little hands and
    the little feet and eventually they turn into something more resemblant of not

    ones you get your platypuses your aidas um sort of your strange animals and eventually
    you get to such such guys as primates uh primat sort of basically souped up tree
    shoes um not sure exactly what to say about that transition there other than like
    we did it um and we're going to go into some more detail about that particular
    transition so we start from these we go from being arboreal uh walking around

    as a afarensis a Aeris Lucy uh you hear sometimes about this cool lady named Lucy
    and she is roughly speaking a bedal ape um the actual Lucy that we refer to is
    is a skeleton that we found I think this is actually at UT Austin I'm not quite
    sure um typically when we find these remains they're they're not they're not complete
    like we don't find them looking like this we find little chunks and pieces um
    Lucy in particular um we got this uh which was which is very complete for in in
    sort of fossil record style um and Lucy is she was famous because it that you
    know we found a very good complete skeleton but there were a bunch of these sort
    of bipedal aplike creatures just all sorts of them we keep finding new new of
    them um you can tell kind of the so the genus is the first word and then the species
    is the second one or both or whatever um we're homos uh but then we have all these

    like we recently found a ton of homoni just like we found a cave that just stuffed
    full of them Google it it's great um they like the cave like you have to be like
    they could the research team had to be a bunch of really tiny people because they
    had to be able to like crawl in through the like small Spelunky holes um but anyways
    but we want to go but let's go back one step further from this and talk about
    uh Arty arpus ramidus [Music] Rus ramidus and less popular than Lucy but still
    pretty good arpus ramidus means the grounded ape um this is thought to be the
    last common the last ancestor that we share with the other great apes so uh Lucy
    is not in the family tree of chimpanzees and bonobos and gorillas arpus ramidus
    is and Arty was able to stand up pretty okay uh had some sort of the pelvis we'll
    talk about the pelvis in a second here um but wasn't a particularly well adapted
    biped notice the feet got these graspy feet things this unfortunately is going
    to be the class where I take my shoes off not quite yet um but if you'll notice
    the we the grabby grabby tree shoes um they still have the grabby on the feet
    uh which means that this guy was thought to be a sort of a a a bad weather biped
    basically the um what's it called Africa you heard of that place where we're from
    um oh uh Lucy was found in the old Devi Gorge which is in Tanzania uh which we
    will talk about briefly but um so this is Africa you may have heard of it um this
    right here is called it's like the great something Rift or something like that
    and it basically like it's geologically very active and it sort of like pulls
    apart and pushes together over the scale of like couple like thousands of years
    and so this will periodically become kind of like this which is like a bunch of
    like livers and rivers and lakes and stuff like that and then it will push together
    and become PLS and things like that so if you are an arboreal guy that lives in
    the jungle it's sometimes you might need to come down from the trees and walk
    from this clump of trees to that clump of trees

    lions and stuff like that so it's probably pretty good to be a little bit better
    at walking so that you can go from One Tree copes to another and not get eaten
    in the vicinity of that the second you start doing that you start getting these
    these very well- evolved appendages that we've been evolving for all these millions
    and millions of years but now for some of your life you're not actually using
    them for anything like they're out they're there they're attached they're very
    good at grabbing they're very attached to our perceptual system because of the
    because of the the arboreal thing um but we're no longer using them for Locomotion
    uh which is a bold move kind looks like you're r a skateboard here that any see
    that just not relevant um uh and so yeah this so Arty is thought to be kind of
    like the beginning of the evolution of obligate by pism obligate means like we
    don't really have many other choices here like like you know bears and chimps
    and gorillas they're mostly knuckle walkers but they can stand up on two feet
    we kind of suck at everything but bipedalism so we are obligate bipedal obligate
    bipeds um there's this great paper by this guy I don't know why this doesn't quite
    work h once again grabb the link go to saub second one down I guess so there's
    this paper so this guy Co Lovejoy um is a paleontologist he say does a lot of
    stuff on human evolution he has this great three-part paper on the evolution of
    human gate and posture that talks about the spine and pelvis and femur and knee
    and stuff like that um a lot of what I'm going to be saying about the skeleton
    is sort of based off of that but he wrote this great paper about artus ramidus
    2009 um because art was discovered relatively recently too it's sort of like every
    you'll hear this thing every so often we found a missing link it's like yeah great
    we found another one um but he wrote this paper about uh the evolution of bism
    which has what is perhaps my favorite uh section my favorite paragraph I've ever
    read um so one of the things that happens a lot in this area of research or the
    human evolution is everyone's always trying to sort of like these days we try
    not to like lean too hard into it but there's always this kind of question about
    like what does our history say about us now uh and one of the sort of core essential
    questions of like are we just sort of like inherently violent Monsters by nature
    or are we or or is the sort of the care and kindness part of us is that also core

  text: are we fighting against our nature when we do care and kindness or or is that
    is that inbuilt as much as the violence and death and often that is kind of um
    if we look at our nearest Cousins we have chimpanzees and bonobos um chimpanzees
    are relatively violent creatures uh I'm not going to talk too much about it but
    um perhaps my favorite living scientist uh what's her name Jane Goodall did a
    lot of really important work in discovering that chimpanzees are not just pure
    violent they have like complex social structures and things like that um yeah
    story of how of that process is one of my favorites but I'm not going to lean
    into it too hard right now um but generally speaking chimps are very violent uh
    bonobos tend to solve their problems through gentler means um so there's kind
    of there's this question of like where do we really live like we we do like we're
    separated from them we're not we didn't come from either of them we are of the
    same family um so this this paragraph here uh was asking about like how the origins
    of bipedalism plays into that story of like the inherent violence or the not so
    violent life uh I'll read it in full a frequent explanation for the K9 reduction
    in bipedality so we have crappy teeth we're bad at biting um is that handheld
    weapons replaced thec which is superior K9 something or another uh pointy teeth
    pointy the handmade weapons replac the SEC but if male toale agonism had been
    fundamental to early homonid Fitness what selective agency would have reduced
    its signature character the bitey bitey teeth additional human attributes belly
    the improbability of the weapons argument the absence of sperm competition in
    gorillas and orangutans is accompanied by a dramatically reduced testes size and
    the elimination of a free scrotum their testes are more judiciously sequestered
    at the in a post penal penal bulge in contrast not only are human scotum more
    pendulous than those of the chimp than even those of the chimpanzees but bipedality
    makes them extraordinarily vulnerable during upright combat it seems illogical
    to attribute habitual uprightness to weapons that would demand even greater selection
    for testes sequestration that is then is present in other Prim AG which Target
    them with their functional sec's so the argument here is that the fact that we
    are bipeds with pendulus testes not all of us but some of us uh is argument that
    at this point in our Evolution the main determinant of our survival was not our
    ability to kill other bipeds and chop chew their parts

    uh so ramidus comes along early bipad walking around still not but still AP likee
    not a not a proper um not a proper bipad um Lucy shows up and Lucy is a proper
    biped uh where's that part I missed that part um because yeah so oh yeah here's
    the picture so these are the homos these are the pan pan chitis Which is the chimps
    and the bonobos um and then this is where arpus hangs out I guess not the gorillas
    I guess Arty was a was not a gorilla uh fan um I'm going to talk about the Le
    fly Footprints before the rest of it so actually no I'm not um so these are three
    lower bodies the Bony parts of the lower bodies and this one is roughly speaking
    you these are modern humans this one here is the australopith like a afarensis
    that's your Lucy and then this is your chimpanzees your P pantog um and the thing
    to notice here is that there's there's a lot of things that are different here
    um the main one to notice to First is the pelvis um a good friend C Lovejoy said
    another one of my favorite lines which is that the human pelvis is the most phylogenically
    distinct osteological structure in the animal kingdom biogenically distinct meaning
    like evolutionarily weird osteological structure bony Chunk in the animal kingdom
    um because there's really not another analog for a creature that has a pelvis
    that looks like this the main thing to notice is it's small it's Squat and it's
    got these big swoopy Wing things these are your uh your anterior your iliac spines
    um this is different from most pelvises in the sort of Maman Kingdom at least
    um even outside where the IL are sort of more flat along the back um not that
    and the effects of this so this is a a looks like a gorilla or chimp leg with

  text: muscles and this is a human leg with muscles and one of the main features
    there is that the uh the AP Parts you get all this really powerful musculature
    for the back um and and it sort of but it sort of squeezes the spine in so you
    get these very stiff but extremely strong backs but you cannot stand all the way
    up uh so just the nature of the musculature means that like that's why if you
    see it if you look at videos of chimps and gorillas walking they tend to walk
    like this so when they they they can they can get their their their Center of
    mass over their base of support which as we know is important for standing and
    walking but they they do it by like this is tiring like I can't really do this
    for very long cuz you know the legs are bent and whatnot and so I have to be using
    my muscles to stand up here whereas we have the these Ilia are sort of wide open
    on the top so we get this sort of swoopy spine lordosis spine this is one of the
    many ways people will tell you that you're busted but this sort of backwards bendy
    spine right here um this is healthy this your lordosis is a thing that you need
    you don't want to flat back so we have two we have your cervical what's I forget
    the term but there's the the spine bends it's three times once at the neck around
    the thorax and then here around the lumbar and then our little sort of false tail
    wimpy tail things and so because we don't have those Ilia running up our backs
    we have our Ilia sort of M on the sides we get these sort of really flexible spines
    and that allows us to stand upright uh over our base of support with everything
    all lined up and so I'm not using I'm using my muscles now but only like you know
    to keep the the limbs from flopping out mostly right now I'm standing on my bones
    um so we get that from our spines or the flexibility of the spin which are freed
    up by the pelvis um and then we also because of the sort of swoopy nature on the
    outside of the pelvis we get all these great attachment points for this type of
    motion abduction so you got abduction which takes it away adduction which takes
    it towards really stupidly named uh degree of freedom but we get a lot of this
    so uh very useful again for being able to like control your body when you're standing

    draw like a skeleton naively you would probably draw it like this you think of
    your your legs as coming straight down from your hips but we don't actually stand
    like that we can put our feet happily in line directly under our hips despite
    the fact that my hips are like 45 cm wide and uh but I can happily comfortably
    put my feet together beneath them because we have this carrying angle that where
    our femur is sort of cut in and you can see that in your body is if you look if
    you look at your knee the inner bulb the inner condal is bigger like you we've
    known this about your knee for a long time it's lumpier on the inside than it
    is on the outside and that's so that when it cuts in like this it sits flat on
    top of the tibia which is where you're limits so that carrying angle is what allows
    us to stand with our feet directly under our Center of mass as we are standing
    upright with these weird sort of spindly behaviors uh very um precarious but we
    get pretty good at it uh the other thing we get and I'm going to do it now sorry
    uh is we get feet so we gave so you have probably at one point in your life wished
    that you could grab things with your feet you can a little bit but we're bad at
    it um but if you look at your hand there are sort of two main axes right you have
    the this grasping axis and you have this opposable thumb that's the the opposable
    side of it and because we have two axes we can move them relative to each other
    and have a whole grasping area uh and our good friends the Apes have that same
    sort of arrangement so they have the graspy feet but there's always going to be
    a trade-off so the thing that that they don't have so basically this this thing
    right here is called your big toe and fancily called your HX hux it is unbelievably
    strong relative to the rest of your body like my whole body weight I can just
    rep it on my big toe and like these little the other toes there and so what happened
    is that in the evolutionary time as we sort of stopped being AR Boral and we started
    becoming obligate bipeds uh we sort of became much more accustomed and acquainted
    to the ground and so rather than having the sort of really finely tunable uh sort
    of graspy appendages we took that strong axis and moved it in line with the long
    axis of the foot and so instead so now we don't get uh a grasping Dimension but

    we are specialized at the at being able to control the forces under our feet and
    we we that was so helpful to us that we gave up the ability to grasp by just moving
    the thumb in line with the long axis of the foot so now as we are walking through
    the world as we sort of hit the ground with our heel typically and the uh the
    center of pressure moves from the back of your foot to the front of your foot
    you can control that force and that Center of pressure with with a lot of power

    time yes and so now in the spirit of so we're so with Nui were like sixish million
    years ago 6 to S million years ago um see grasby um I also recently like do my
    back out which is a thing that happens which is sort of like another one of the
    big disadvantages of the wiggly spine move so it's sort of like I'm here like
    oh look we have our flexible spines I'm like man like chimps don't throw their
    spines out like their upper back like their lats connect like straight to their
    pelvis um like roughly speaking um which is like that why they're they're so strong
    relative to us because their muscle attachments allow them to be um but they lose
    Precision um and that's true on the neural level for some at some level but also
    just at the muscular skeletal level like the structure of that body is just it's
    power not Precision um yeah so Lucy is so she's got all the same features that
    we do got our feet got our pelvis got our spine got our knee uh got our carrying
    angle we also have a carrying angle on our arms so we can they like they they
    hitch out so they sort of don't hit our pelvis um and she has that chimp Stone

    ago and they cor there's roughly 70 Footprints in that region uh Le toi toi and
    and it was basically a it was some area where there was some some event happened
    some uh volcanic event or just rain event or something like that so there was
    this layer of like chuff I think they call it with just like like strange wet
    mud and during a particular sort of state of that mud uh I think they said I think
    it's three hominids walked across that mud two big ones and one small one and
    if you believe the sort of poetic stories it's a family if you are less into that
    we really don't have a good way to know but there's two big ones and two there's
    two big ones and a small one and at one point in the walk the small one starts
    walking in the footprints of the big one and 4 million years ago and they have
    and and so they do a lot of analyses of like the squish patterns under of the
    of the so they walked across and then something else happened and this got covered
    and the footprints fossilized and then later on some uh European colonizer found
    them and uh was wrote them down so they were discovered uh and then like they
    they took scans they took cast they took all sorts of stuff and then they reburied
    them because they were not they couldn't take them out of the ground um so they
    they they marked them they took a bunch of measurements took a bunch of casts
    and then put the dirt back over them again uh because they didn't want to remove
    them from the ground and they also didn't want it to be like a tourist attraction
    because they didn't want it to get ruined so these are still hanging out somewhere
    out near Old The Gorge Tanzania uh just being what they are um and so if they
    look at the so this is a a chimp walking um their back the back foot of a chimp
    and you can see like that a posable foot and the footprints that you see in the
    Lei uh Footprints was someone that used heel toe walking so rather than doing
    like the sort of the whatever they do um they were walking heel to toe and sort
    of the center of pressure moving along the long axis of their foot being controlled

    of the big one it seems like something I might do if I was in a muddy field with

    snow um and this guy wasn't us they were not Arty was not us she was a different
    cousin friend she was was a chimp she is no more close to us than than a chimpanze
    would be um but you know we are related so yeah so then we hung out and so so
    now we're in we're on our Branch now of the tree there's no one else on this Branch
    but us no one else remaining on this Branch but us um and there's a couple extra
    steps in here so you get Homo erectus which I think I think Homo erectus was called
    that they were also a good biped and I think but then like we discovered Lucy
    later and she was like a better like biped and so um not homo but she's a tropicus
    get I don't really the distinctions there get murky for me um but then we get
    Homo habilis uh Tulio not really no one no one called him that but I think it's
    funny um homohabilis people like to say is the origin of tool use um but we don't
    really know obviously uh so the the actual first tool user in our lineage is somewhere
    in this range and we know that largely by just what they left behind so mostly
    that comes in the form of stone tools but if you think about like if you're out
    in the woods what's the first thing you pick up it's not necessarily a rock it's
    like a stick uh and if you're going out and you're killing animals you might wear
    their fur you might do stuff like that none of that's going to leave a fossil
    in the same way that that a good rock will um so a lot of the early evidence that
    we have for Tool use comes from the form of stone tools and there was a really
    great talk that I saw once um from someone whose name I don't remember couldn't
    fig couldn't find of looking at because we have a ton of uh of of evidence of
    these stone tools because these are literal rocks we don't have to wait for some
    like fancy special uh like fossilization event it's just a rock so you can start
    looking for box that are basically like uh stone tools that are in places that
    you wouldn't expect uh old stone tools um yeah actually I think it might have
    been I think the author of this paper might be the guy I'm thinking about because
    I think this is what this is about um but so the origin of these tools and evolution
    of these tools um fit a particular kind of there was also an evolution that happened

    really shouldn't be and they would have wear patterns on them that they really
    shouldn't have uh through natural processes and it's seems like someone's like
    I like this Rock I'm going to carry this Rock With Me Do they have a bag to put
    it in probably not the first ones but eventually they probably did and the bag
    didn't stick around but the rock probably did and the first actually and probably
    before that so that's that's the hand axe era of human tool use and that was most
    of our evolutionary history was hand axes um they would also find these flakes
    so something else that they would do is they would find particular rocks um and
    they learned which rocks would shatter well and they would after after they would
    hunt and kill something they would find these rocks they would just smash them
    on the ground and pick up the sharp parts and use that to do the carving um so
    they weren't really shaping the Rocks they were just smashing and sort of like
    picking through the rest of the good stuff and as you sort of go through the history
    here I'm guessing about what this paper is but you can see that they sort of the
    the tools become more and more sophisticated over the course of like millions
    of years Aon types of time time periods and it starts from just like this is a
    good rock and it goes to these like these are good rock flakes you would find
    rock flakes near where you would find like evidence of some hunting and then you
    would start to get get like more and more advanced sort of uh tools which require
    which would have required more and more advanced cognitive abilities until you
    get to like the latter Parts like of the you know the stuff that we we still till
    use today in some some sort of areas uh the most modern form of stone tool use
    where you would get these very very complex things where in order to make that
    type of a tool you can't just smash the rock you can't just smash the Rock and
    hope that it comes out sharp you have to like shape it in a particular way and
    then once it's ready one big smack would sort of would Shear off the whole thing
    and then you could start that's how you would form these like really perfectly
    shaped things and so the paper if this is the one that it is was the guy learning
    how to do that type of technique and realizing that once you get to a certain
    area you're no longer doing like a stimulus response thing like you're planning
    ahead like you're you're you're you're doing this this this this this this this
    this this this this this okay now it's ready and then one big smack to get it
    to Shear off in their nice carvable blade and so there's this interesting story
    of the evolution of our cognitive capacity that gets told through the complexity
    of the stone tools that we find scattered along the way and again just I think
    it's worth making the point again if you were doing this you're almost certainly
    doing other stuff too you almost certainly have cool sticks and cool rocks and

    and so they're probably doing stuff if they were painting themselves if they were
    doing something resembling art we find cave art and stuff like that uh our ability
    to know that is lost because those things don't leave evidence um yeah and then

    and there were a bunch of there's a bunch of homos running around the uh Eurasian
    continent for a good long time and then they died some somehow or another they
    all just died out except for us there were certainly some Extinction events uh
    there were some pretty narrow bottlenecks at some point where they say like down

    we don't really know we're the only ones left um a lot of them died off we might
    have killed some of them we probably interbred with neander tals um we all have

    couldn't breed together it's like well that's speciation is kind of complicated

    monsters is kind of one of the things there uh there's a lot of evidence around
    the early Homo sapiens that we were we started becoming nice in some way shape
    and form like we find skeletons of of humans that had like like bone disorders
    that would have been basically like immobile their entire life uh so if they lived
    to be the age that we that they were when we found them there was somebody taking
    care of them that entire time we find burials of of skeletons with like really
    valuable really well-carved stone tools in the grave with them so somebody loved
    this person enough to give up a very valuable tool when they when they walked
    away from it and there also of other stuff like we like uh one of our many superpowers
    is that we have like a healing Factor relative to other animals we heal much better
    than most creatures um and evidence for that from like these skeletons were like
    they were busted up like a lot of these old school humans like they broke their
    bones all the time and so you find these evidence of like uh bones that broke
    and then reheal and during that time that person was useless they were not contributing
    to the group while they were healing from an injury at that scale so somebody
    was taking care of them so even though we were horrifying creatures like we dominated
    the landscape by basically being able to jog indefinitely it's kind of one of
    our things is we just we like show up and the deer Sprints and we Jog and we learn
    how to throw this was a power move big problem for the world because it's like
    you're over there but I have like these like like this very mobile powerful dextrous

    to do is get close enough to the deer to hit it with a rock and then it Sprints
    off and then I jog after it and then I get close enough to hit it with another
    rock and it doesn't take very long before that deer stops being able to Sprint

    on the sort of Zoological scale basically the same um gorillas not that way uh
    and I wanted to and so male female this is more just this is not uh something
    I forgot to say earlier but uh yeah so this is the male gorilla that's the female
    gorilla smaller and sort of smoother head but the thing I really want to point
    out is this this is called the sagittal Crest and this is this is present in a
    lot of animals especially like the bitey bitey ones um and it's basically an attachment
    point for the jaw muscles so for a gorilla they have that pointy head uh and other
    animals have this too if you have a dog feel on their head they'll have a sagittal
    Crest um cats have kind of a pretty wimpy one but it's basically an attachment
    point so the jaw muscles go from here through the cheekbones and attach up top
    there and so this is sort of part of our uh our wimpy wimpy bite is that we we
    gave a lot of that up so if you find your jaw muscles here so like on the edge
    of your jaw and like squeeze your teeth you can find your jaw muscles it goes
    up through like under the cheekbones and then if you put your hands kind of on
    your temples here and bite again you'll find where the the where they attach take
    that part and kind of push it together don't do it in reality but imagine doing
    it and where that meets is going to be something like that uh and so we suck at
    biting relative to other animals like don't bite anybody I mean follow your heart
    but don't if you if you had to choose between getting bit by a person or getting
    CH bit by a chimpanzee person all day um because we gave up a lot of that real
    estate to have those muscle attachment points now cuz if in the same way that
    you can imagine pushing those muscle points those muscle ATT those jaw muscle
    attachment points together into something like a sagittal crust now imagine poofing

    by doing so we gave up a lot of that real estate for being able to bite so back
    to that sort of story about the pendulous of our forbears um that was sort of
    part of the question is like at some point we stopped being good like sort of
    like raw like like our ability to like kill each other with our bare bodies got
    worse and so this question of like what happened in that in that region so there
    so love joy talks about the the weapons hypothesis which is like we didn't need
    the teeth anymore because we had the weapons then he's like but that that story
    actually doesn't really track because of the pendulous argument and so what we
    get to what's a pretty decent end of this weird story which is that it seems that
    the actual thing that we developed which allowed us to dominate allowed us to
    kill much pointier animals and be the thing that is sort of everywhere and sort
    of learns how to go to space and learns what stars are and things like that was
    our ability to be kind social animals like we we worked together with people we
    took care of them when they were ill um and we let them walk in our footprints
    when we had to and that's sort of the story of how we got here and yeah that's
    about okay that's about that I think that's about the story that's human evolution

    for someone to ask a question it reminds you something you wanted to talk about
    um chimp hands so they have so like our tendons are fairly uh stretchy and thin
    um which gives us more Dexter Dex dexterity there uh chimps have they're they
    are the resting state of our hand is this like our our with our fingers straight
    um chimps and a lot of the other like tree climbing animals their resting state
    is like that because their their um their what's the tendons are thicker and shorter
    um and so when they're when they hang out they hang out like this and so if you're
    if you're grasping from that perspective it's going to be stronger because like
    the the rubber bands attached to it are thicker um and it's another so they have
    very very strong grip um but they lose some of that Precision there's also some
    evidence I've heard suggesting about like um the distribution this is getting
    this is now more Neuroscience like like something about the distribution of like
    motor units in their muscles um we have lots and lots and lots of motor units
    like spread throughout our muscles particularly in our hands and things like that
    and when we are activating our a particular joint we do so by basically firing
    one of those motor units in the muscle um and so we because we have so many we
    have the ability to like do a gradient of that so we don't fire them all at the
    same time which gives us the ability to make small subtle movements my understanding
    is that chimps and things like that it's much more All or Nothing so they they
    I think it's like kind of I might be getting this wrong but I think it's um what's
    the word uh counterintuitively they have like fewer motor units because when they
    when they say grasp they're they're they're always going to be grasping with close
    to their full strength whereas we have the ability to have more gradient control
    so there is the The Leverage aspect of just where the muscle attachments are there's
    also like the the complexity of like the the tendons and stuff like that and there's
    arguably possibly something going on at the level of the nervous system like cortical
    spinal tract kind of stuff where it's like we have the ability to make our muscles
    do more fine grained movements which has a trade-off to being able to do like
    full power things cuz also it's like if you're always going full bore with every
    movement then you're also going to develop more hypertrophic muscles over the
    course of your life so there's this kind of like there's the leverage there's
    the M there's the actual muscular tendon stuff there's the neural structure and
    there's like the lifetime

  text: of being a creature with this type of thing like where does the actual strength
    come from so it's always going to be this kind of like overlapping kind of weird
    story there um was there something else I wanted to say on that probably uh yeah
    okay thank you for the question uh I I always like to point out this just because
    it's like it's literally just they have shorter thicker tendons and so they're
    better at this which is good because they live that life um so yeah there's this
    whole like the interplay between like the muscular skeletal structure and the
    neural controller and the and the lifetime of experience and like it's always
    everything all at once um yeah and that's the class so so thank you thanks for
    showing up
