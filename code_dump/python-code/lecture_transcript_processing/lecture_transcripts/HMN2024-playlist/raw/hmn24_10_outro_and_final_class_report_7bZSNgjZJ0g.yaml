full_transcript: okay hello everybody and welcome to the last class of the semester
  uh right right okay good yeah so went very fast um yeah so thanks for showing up
  uh thanks for sticking around um there's no final you're all good um and today I'm
  mostly going to be talking about uh sort of some wrapup stuff I'll be presenting
  my final project which I hope will be to your approval uh my final project is making
  sense of the massive gobs of text yall put into the machine um and sort of thinking
  about what that looks like uh I've it pulls out i' I've have something that pulls
  out like sort of like a weird report for each of you based on just like this person
  has been talking about these things and then uh I don't think I'll take up nearly
  the entire class so my intention is sort of like situate to that situate yall to
  to that data show you some little fun things I just added to the machine um and
  then yeah and then for the rest of the for the sort of remainder of the time I sort
  of do this sort of small group thing and sort of uh you can like look over what
  the bot think you're into um sort of talk about it in your little group uh I'll
  come around and sort of like chat with you a bit about what's going on there um
  and then we'll be roughly good uh I'm also going to talk a little bit about if you're
  interested in this type of thing the research that I do in my life and in my lab
  and that kind of stuff we'll talk about a couple Avenues you can take to involve
  yourself in the future coming semesters and all that um so let's see what order
  should I do this end let's do the the boring oh I also want to do like a quick uh
  tutorial on how to set up your own Skelly bot server because it's very easy to do
  so it's just a couple of clicks and um you can have your own version of this thing
  and run it until I until I shut it down at which point um which I don't know probably
  won't be very soon because I'm still I'm going to be working on it continuously
  um so we're going to do that uh before the second half a class so if anyone has
  questions want to set that up uh you can do so um don't use it to cheat but it's
  no different than any other AI thing and so I don't feel like I'm giving you any
  forbidden Weaponry that wouldn't already be available so yeah I'll good by that
  um so yeah let's start with the procedural stuff so if you want to if you're curious
  about this type of research this sort of General domain and you would like to keep
  um affiliated with the weird stuff I do in my life um the easiest way to do that
  is To Join This Server which is the research server that I run um in for my lab
  and research and you errands in there and there's a an accumulation of other students
  from various iterations of My Life um it's human research lab sort of like a play
  it's not a play it's just a sort of weird acronym of human movement neuroscience
  and the specific tag that I put for Northeastern students is numans NE m o n just
  because it's funny um so I will take this uh how do I that invite people uh edit
  invite never expire generate New Link copy that link go to our server go to I guess
  announcements uh if you want to join my research lab server click here and then
  you can do that so you click that you'll pop up in the server and then you know
  it's used kind of in a function way so um it might be sort of like conversations
  you're just jumping into the middle of um but I'll make announcements there about
  like what the general like on campus sort of I have like an Open Lab meeting type
  of thing that I do um and I'll put the schedule there and in general mostly also
  in specific um the oncampus lab thing that I do is always open invite and it's always
  like open schedule so if if there's like a time period that it's going on and you
  can only show up for part of that time show up for part of that time you don't need
  to ask to show up if you show up in a year and a half well I may not be here but
  if you show up in a 6 months um whe you don't have to announce it just show up it'll
  be good um and the other place you can go wait who's in The Voice channel here is
  it me oh somebody somebody accidentally joined the voice channel uh to exit you
  click on this thing where is it uh somebody else d The Voice Channel you'll figure
  it out uh the other place if you're curious about specifically the free moap side
  of this thing free moap is the moap mapy thing we did at the beginning this is the
  server for that this is a more public facing thing um last I checked there were
  2500 some odd folks in there um hanging out sort of a roughly at this point I think
  pretty even mix between um like students and researchers and Neuroscience robotics
  clinical stuff um and then about an equal mix of animators game designers mostly
  on the sort of Indie side of things so if you're curious about that right here say
  if you want to join the free moap project public server click here and um yeah that's
  the sort of public facing space so if you're curious about that project want to
  get involved want to see what's going on there um lot more going on in that space
  um you know different vibe uh public facing type of thing so you're welcome to do
  that um yeah and then so thinking about next semester uh I don't quite know what
  the schedule's going to be over winter break that's always kind of a grab bag but
  um in the in the spring semester I will have some kind of a uh lab meeting type
  of thing once a week on campus um it'll mostly be you know me and Aaron meeting
  up and doing stuff and on the research side of things mostly at Richard's 453 we'll
  talk about I'll post at some point in the winter break I will post something in
  the schedule there um but I think it sort of depends on what my class schedule is
  which I haven't fully checked yet but it'll be it's I think it'll be something on
  Thursday afternoons when Tuesday or Thursday afternoons but just keep an eye out
  there um and you'll see what's up uh and yeah same kind of basic rules as before
  like the white dots on the channels just means that there has been some message
  posted and a red number means that you have specifically been tagged um if you see
  a red one showing up from the lab server it's because I've probably tagged the Numan
  role which means like open conversation open announcement for all any student Affiliated
  humans um yeah the other thing this is a little more um I'm not sure if anyone would
  be properly into this but I will also make an announcement about uh what I'm going
  to be doing in the class I'm doing next semester um so that's going to be a um an
  inquiry session so it's the first semester freshman which y'all presumably all did
  at some level um it's going to be basically the same class except split into twice
  a week so I'm going to cover mostly the same topics just in a shorter form and what
  I'm going to do is it's going to be sort of split half and half for one of the weeks
  one of the the one of the sessions I believe I believe it's Tuesday Thursday and
  the Tuesday one will be like lectur types of stuff and then the Thursday one will
  be more like researchy types of things so talking you know the the the talking to
  the bot um there'll be more time to do like actual data analysis stuff like that
  cuz um I think the way that you're usually do inquiries is like you're supposed
  to present like on a paper at the end of the semester but I do it more like you
  do like a little mini research project so if anyone is interested in the timing
  works out um that will also be kind of like open invite for upper classman types
  who want to show up and have an opportunity to you know dig a little deeper into
  the stuff participate in kind of a more like constrained research project um you
  know help some young freshman figure out what papers are um and youve got you've
  seen how this goes like there's a lot of surface area and there's really not in
  many like if I were to teach this class to a room full of professional researchers
  I would not I would teach it in almost the exact same way that I did like I didn't
  dumb it down for you I won't be dumbing it down for them there's not really a way
  to dumb it down because it's just their surface area is so huge there's really nobody
  that has the sort of the the specific areas of knowledge that I'm teaching except
  for like me and that's just because I'm the one standing up here so um with specifically
  on that research side of things if you wanted to show up you would have you know
  the ability to kind of like you know mix and match and sort of help out people as
  are doing stuff like maybe push some people in certain directions to sort of get
  them to look at things that you care about um and then you know they present at
  the end of the semester um anyone that you helped with you get your name on the
  poster and youa I put like a source thing the student undergrad research thing which
  is a nice way to kind of like pad the resume with a bunch of lines of like I helped
  with research projects and it will be legitimate so um you know I don't know if
  anyone feels like sitting in on an additional class for which you will get no credit
  uh but you might enjoy the experience so I will also make that sort of announcement
  once I know more about what that schedule will be um yeah and also similarly like
  uh I guess will sort of depend cuz the I was going to say you can sort of come and
  go whenever you want throughout the semester which is true but also uh it has never
  been the case that the way the class goes is the way that I think it will have gone
  so uh I'll make an announcement it's sort of before the beginning of the semester
  about what I think the vibe will be um and if that shifts just you know I don't
  know ask about it or who cares just show up doesn't matter um yeah oh and on a similar
  note uh I know that for for a lot of y'all's degrees you have to have some kind
  of a research lab um you can also do like independent studies and things like that
  um I don't know you'd have to talk to like the advisor core about what the specific
  rules are but I am opened for a lot of that type of thing I probably don't have
  a ton of my like available time to like do sort of truly independent independent
  studies but if you wanted to do something like that in order to cover a research
  credit or however they do that um I'd be happy to work something out that would
  sort of overlap with the stuff I'm doing with the inquiries class and sort of find
  some way that you could pick a project and sort of interact that way um because
  I have heard that it is like a like finding space in those research classes can
  be difficult and often times it's not studying it's like the the domain of inquiry
  may not be what you're particularly interested in particularly for the data science
  minded folks uh yeah okay so there is that um also just to note again I think I've
  said this before but in the resources Channel there's a link to this uh playlist
  of uh YouTube recordings which are basically these ones that have been recorded
  um it's every lecture except for one where I screwed it up and the video was corrupted
  um but you know they're available they're online they will be online presumably
  until you know Google dies or The Sun Burns Out whichever comes first um probably
  Google but we'll see uh and yeah so all the things I just said if you want to check
  in it'll be there um the lecture from last time for the majority of you who weren't
  here is up there um and yeah and at some point not now hopefully before the end
  end of the semester hopefully for the end of winter break skybot will have the ability
  to eat YouTube URLs so just kind of give it a URL and it'll pull a transcript and
  eat it and give a sort of summary that way so you could wait you could review what
  we've been going on what's been going on here uh one of the funny things about like
  teaching a class like this using specifically like a techie tool that I have built
  um every class sort of Builds on the functionalities of the previous one so this
  class uh I think the main advant the main thing I completed with this I didn't really
  add any functionality to the bot throughout the course of this semester um but I
  did a lot in terms on like in the back end in terms of like analyzing and processing
  the data and sort of producing these reports we're going to talk about so um and
  I think into the next semester I want to add more ability for the bot to kind of
  pull information into a given chat so if you have like oh here's a PDF that care
  about or here's like a DOI or something like that or a YouTube video or a website
  or you know a massive you know an actual paper um adding functionality that the
  bot will be able to just like you could be in a chat and say like hey know about
  this thing and it'll just like pull it in and then you could ask questions about
  that um so that'll be fun um cool and I'm sure there's questions about that that
  that's what the second half of will be about yeah with that yeah hope so uh roughly
  it sort of depends um a lot of this it I like that both of those tasks are pretty
  similar at a certain level it's like adding to the context and like particularly
  for large things it's like there's a vector search type of thing that wants to happen
  otherwise the cont like if you pull in like a 300 page document that's so much text
  it'll kind of like overwhelm the conversation so there's stuff you got to do to
  to make that more efficient um and at a certain level like the difference between
  pulling a transcript from a YouTube video and chopping up a PDF um those differences
  are not that significant relative to the just like the core task of like adding
  that that functionality to the the bot itself so um it sort of depends I have other
  things to do and there sort of the ability to judge the scale of a task is an impossible
  forever task so I hope to add stuff like that before next semester but time will
  tell um but if you yeah I mean uh I also intend like the to for at the moment the
  bot has mostly been just like a thing that I make and play with and sort of give
  to some people and some other professors have used it but it hasn't really been
  a public facing project like free moap is um I'm going to start doing that for this
  project starting probably through next semester I want to that to be kind of like
  a slow roll um so that will that will change the vibe a lot it will hopefully become
  something of like a proper open source project um as opposed to like a toy that
  I'm hanging and playing with um and just in general I think like there's some very
  interesting like teaching methods emerging of like you know the stuff we're going
  to talk about shortly about like just this very interesting process of I show I
  can give these incredibly dense lectures and then walk around and have y'all all
  kind of like like whichever part of that Peak your interest you get to explore that
  to um some interest I think there's there's some there's something interesting there
  that I'm curious about keeping the pushing up keeping uh keeping uh exploring and
  then making that available to other educational humans um be they teacher types
  are just like people who like to learn things um incidentally I'm kind of talking
  backwards here but I often do um part of the reason why I want to focus on pulling
  external context into conversations is uh related to this sort of like realization
  that I had when I was doing the final sort of wrapup of the kind of like the oroboros
  nature of AI text where like there were a lot of conversations they were I I know
  from experience that they were all mostly on point mostly accurate and mostly saying
  like the rightish kind of things but no one's checking the work here like and I
  hope y'all were like look just sort of on your own um but I wasn't like I was just
  was you know like the bot read like I was thinking about like order of or like distances
  from a human and distances from the empirical measurement the sort of like this
  chain of of of reasoning we've talked about lot of research settings where it's
  like you the human asks a question and the bot produces an answer and at the end
  of that you have a conversation where the like these human bot couplets and then
  you summarize that and you say okay here's the summary of that conversation you
  summarize the summaries and okay here's like a report on that thing but no one but
  at some point you're just s like the AI text is analyzing the AI text is analyzing
  the a text and sort of that like it progresses farther and F farther from like the
  real natural world so I think it's not too insane to imagine a a setting here where
  like the bot looks at the questions and goes and like pulls some review articles
  from PubMed and then instead of just like saying what it thinks it should say based
  off of its training it can sort of say what it thinks it should say based off its
  training plus articles pulled from humans who have presumably qualified ifications
  and peer review and empirical measurements behind them at some level so yeah with
  that in mind let's talk about let's talk about where we got with this thing okay
  so as before uh in the resources channel in the sort of there's she won't look like
  that for you there's this server scrape checkpoints and the back the last one here
  is the last one I intend to produce um and yeah but before before we go into that
  oh I leared how to do this didn't I is it forward or backwards to pull it out I
  remember yeah it was yeah I could remember if it was pull it out or push it in okay
  so quick overview of like the basic algorithm that happened so so here's you you're
  a human congratulations and then here's the bot it's doing its best that that's
  the interational sign for bot um and so you ask a question and the bot produces
  an answer whatever and then we have a couple of those and then we're going to call
  this a chat or a thread or a conversation right so this is sort of the basic unit
  that you've been producing um this whole time and there's this there are these linked
  Blobs of text representing human question I mean I know there were different it
  wasn't always like question answer it was a lot of question answer but you know
  human query bot response human query bot response uh and each one of these things
  is a chat so then we have and so like the the structural aspect of this is like
  you have the server which is the Discord server the the Discord server has categories
  which is the things like the the lectures and the body the bodies and the eyeballs
  and stuff like that we didn't really wind up using a lot of this structure other
  than the lectures thing um but that's okay and then within that each category has
  a certain set of channels channels are named again like there's a prompting thing
  that can happen that again we didn't really use very much of um so but that's okay
  and then within each of these categories each of these are chats and each of the
  chats has as sort of messages here right and so these are the sort of the basic
  units of of the conversation um let's see do I have the numbers here this is one
  of the things where it's like like what you're seeing is what I got done I'm sure
  you are familiar with working under a deadline and the difference between the things
  you hope you can get done and things that actually get done is often quite dramatic
  um but like this is one like oh I should know things like we had this many chats
  and this many words and this many things uh I don't know those numbers at the top
  of my head they might just be shoved in here at some place um but the answer it
  was a lot very the word count was High um like mostly bot talk um in terms of like
  you know human produced text versus bot produced text the bot talked a lot more
  it you know cuz asking a question like what is the cortical spinal tract is not
  very many words the convers but the thing that it says is often quite a lot um I'm
  just going to see if it's see what it be think I can do that is that work yeah don't
  think it's going to give me to me um yeah I mean that's 20,000 no 200,000 lines
  of text but mostly it's not like functional text so I don't really have those hard
  numbers there um okay so so most of the things that we've been showing so far um
  like when I would sort of produce these checkpoints you load them into obsidian
  um the analyses that we were looking at was basically iterating through each of
  these chats and so for every the server there were three categories bunch of channels
  bunch of chats and so You' get like these sort of units of chat and we would I would
  basically feed them back into uh gbt 40 um which is the same llm that's driving
  Skelly bot the main main guy um and it would do things like produce like a summary
  um highlights or whatever and then importantly um it would produce these tags which
  were the sort of hashtag topic whatever thing um and that's most and up until this
  point that's what we had we had a bunch of summaries AI analyses of the chats themselves
  um I added in this round um so you might consider this kind of like a first order
  summary because you're going through each conversation we'll call this like zeroth
  order because like it's human to bot you know each time and then this sort of chat
  summary is kind of like a first order analysis of that so we're going over we're
  lumping up all the conversations we're looking at what's going on in there um but
  there's nothing that we can do at this level that will com that will group across
  different conversations each one of these measurements is are is sort of in is sort
  of independent of anything else that might be going on in the server um so now there
  are two additional categories uh one is by user and another is by topic so by user
  that's all of you guys so basically at that point what I did is I um I cycled through
  all of the conversations I I iterated through each one of you so every uh ID that
  showed up in the Discord server um and then I iterated through all of the available
  chats I think there were like 300 and some OD of these I can't remember exactly
  what the number was um and I grouped all of the chats that you as an individual
  person contributed to and I counted any chat where you sent a single message was
  a chat that you were a part of um and so then I pulled this was a place that I really
  should have done I could have done a little bit extra work here but I ran the exact
  same summary on on this so you get this sort of again the formatting is a little
  weird because the formatting is the same as the one for the chats but you get like
  an AI sort of generated summary of all of the things that you know this person you
  know summary topics tags and so this is kind of the report about yourself um I don't
  fully trust that it's going to do a good job because if you had a lot of conversations
  um then that's a lot of text and so saying hey summarize this very very long text
  you get just kind of wonky results there and the main thing that you see is there's
  a huge um what's the word like initialization bias like the first text that it receives
  is it's over repes presented in the summary so if if the first conversation you
  had was about dogs and then you had a bunch of other conversations about things
  that aren't dogs the summary is going to say this person really likes dogs um just
  by the nature of that there's ways of getting around that but they're more sophisticated
  than what I did so you're going to have you get what you get there um the other
  thing was by topic so I went through and grabbed each of the tags um from all of
  the summaries uh I think not just the chats I didn't look at the tags presumably
  yeah presumably there no there shouldn't be many additional tags showing up here
  because the sort of the list of all users um is just a complete reshuffling of the
  the server structure like all the chats that are in the server are also here I think
  it might be duplications there because if you participate in the same one um and
  so I went through and I found found all of the tags uh that showed up in any conversation
  in any summary of any conversation um and there were like roughly 1,500 of them
  so uh again that the number is a little bit dependent on like the prompting that
  was used to generate them um but there were roughly 1500 tags that showed up in
  all, 1500 sort of unique tags that showed up in all of the conversations of the
  entire server um many of which were kind of like redundant so you have like one
  is like ACL recovery and the other one is ACL repair those are two tags and they
  really should be one um but uh so what I did is I I went through these and rather
  than producing something for every single tag I only produced uh documents for tags
  that had a rank of at least five um where rank means the number of times that they're
  mentioned so every tag that showed up in at least five conversations got this special
  treatment um and that one a little bit different from this summary I I asked it
  to make a Wikipedia style article um so I grabbed I grabbed the topics let's say
  I don't know biomech uh and I grabbed every thread that mentioned that had this
  tag in it and I grouped all of these together and I sent it to a prompt that said
  create an create a Wikipedia style article about this and the prompt I made there
  was literally I went to the Wikipedia style guide copied the whole thing gave it
  to the bot and said make a good prompt out of this style guide it made a pretty
  good one and then now we have that so we have so yeah so that is what we're about
  to see is this something will look very similar um B Bally everything we have been
  seeing up until this point is going to be under a folder called by server obviously
  and then there's going to be two additional ones that's by topic and then by user
  where user is synonymous for student um yeah totally makes sense I'm sure everyone's
  following fully this is one of those things that like a lot of that explanation
  was for me and for anyone curious about what's about to show up so as before I don't
  know which one that one is from um let's see so in downloads okay yeah and this
  is one of those places where like there was a lot of work that happened that is
  just going to be completely invisible from the outside because there was a lot of
  stuff that a you're just never going to see because it was about organization and
  like the ability to do this amount of nonsense and have it be reasonable and have
  any kind of confidence about what's going on there it's mostly an organizational
  task um you'll also never see all the things that were tried and never completed
  and sort of like you know dead ends and stuff like that so say lovey uh okay so
  download the thing open the zip go into obsidian it should be hold hat at this point
  um open the thing um the markdown folder is the one with all the actual documents
  in it the other ones just have uh Json fold Json files and it's white for some reason
  as always P dark mode and let's see what looks like okay and so this is um so unlike
  before there's actually links between the Articles the Articles now so it doesn't
  show anything so it shows up as some links here and then this is if you add the
  tags and look at all those weird guys um we have definitely at this point overwhelmed
  what obsidian was intended for uh there's also one of the things I tried and didn't
  quite get working is sort of building out a better like 3D version of this so you
  can rotate it never quite got that working but you can so in obsidian the little
  gear box at the pro at the bottom click that go to community plugins turn on community
  plugins browse 3D I think this none of these are quite what I want them to be um
  but they're better than what I have which is nothing I just search for 3D and I
  just turn on the top three because they're all uh not quite what I want in slightly
  different ways so you can at least look at them and mostly it's just this is not
  going to be like useful it's just going to be like oh look uh so those show up do
  that one so this one is fun be it doesn't this is just a thing it doesn't show the
  tags but it kind of you can start to see like how some of these things work so like
  Neuroscience is attached to everything uh something movement is attached to many
  things and a lot these other ones just aren't linked right mostly because they didn't
  generate the the tags the links properly um this one's a little better it also doesn't
  show tags someone gets a special place in my heart because they plotted the XYZ
  in the origin there um it does a better job of showing the the titles um but it
  also doesn't show the the tags this one shows the tags but it's also a bit of a
  horror show someone got too excited about Bloom which is that brightness effect
  and then there commands here display control you can turn the Bloom down but not
  off so but it does show the route the tags um it's in green I believe uh yeah so
  that one oh this one's by user so again there's not much more to say about this
  um about about this representation of this the graph structure other than to kind
  of just note um the the general eneral Vibe of it which is that these are a bunch
  of very interconnected topics in a very and this exploration even though it's not
  particularly functionally organized this is representative of this is the shape
  of your Collective curiosity about the topic of human movement neuroscience and
  if you were to click through which we will in a second here you would see a bunch
  of different conversations hundreds of different conversations of each of you asking
  some kinds of questions about some kinds of things that you want wanted to know
  more about and although there's you know the topic itself constrains the questions
  to some extent um and if I were to teach this class again um with a bunch of different
  people you would see a lot of overlap in the questions that were asked but it wouldn't
  be complete overlap if it was a different room full of people you would have asked
  different questions and then the results would have different components here um
  and there's something I think really neat about that uh I remember at one point
  in the semester after I think the motor hierarchy uh lecture um right you know gave
  a very dense run through of a bunch of different parts of your nervous system um
  I remember went going around to talk to people after that and you were talking to
  the bot and every single group that I talked to was asking about something different
  um there was no overlap between the things that you were curious about which was
  really cool and really surprising to me like you know you kind of expect it's like
  oh they're all going to be interested in this they're all going to be interested
  in that but every one of you was interested in something different about that lecture
  and because of the the friendly machine um you're all able to explore that uh curiosity
  in a way that was constrained by the by the lecture constrained by the topic constrained
  by the reality of having of the human nervous system but shaped specifically by
  the questions that you asked and the sort of the Curiosities that you brought to
  the table um and that's something I think that's very indicative of a lot of the
  world and a lot of the way that we do scientific research like to some extent there
  is this I think very incorrect view of science that it is it's an objective thing
  and that there's no human element to it and you hear people say things like oh if
  we deleted all the scientific textbooks in a thousand years we'd have the same textbooks
  and that's not entirely false it's there would certainly be like we would discover
  the same things we would discover that there's a spinal cord and that there's a
  big lumpy pink thing on top um and we would discover things like Rodman's areas
  and that the occipital that this is where the vision stuff happens but the the concepts
  that that evolve and sort of arise from scientific research are shaped by the people
  that do the the researching they and the the the the the terms and terminology and
  sort of like um Frameworks that we develop they're human things that we create in
  order to help us understand the world that we're a part of and they're shaped by
  the world um you can't just make them up there's rules about sort of the things
  you can say but it's a very human endeavor and it's something that I think is really
  important to think about um this is also not directly related to this but there's
  this concept in philosophy of science which I think is one of the more Core Concepts
  of uh the it's called the the quinian web of belief um in wvo Quin is the guy um
  but the idea is that your knowledge of the world you as an individual you as a collective
  you as a culture as a community as a species your beliefs about the world are interconnected
  webs of beliefs and the little then each part of it is overlaps with everything
  else and when you are going out and trying to explore new things and learn new knowledge
  um when you learn some new piece of information that information has to be integrated
  into that web of the of all the things that you believe about the world and if that
  if the new piece of knowledge is consistent with that web then that's no problem
  you put it in there you tag it to other things and then you're You Now understand
  the world better if there's a conflict between you go out and you learn some new
  fact and then you try to put it in your web of belief and it doesn't fit or it it
  overlaps or it conflicts with something else the you have to choose to either reject
  the new fact and say this must not be true or you have to go in and prune your tree
  and figure out the things that this contradicts are those things is it what's the
  cost there is it more costly to reject the new fact or is it more costly to shift
  around the tree and change things in ways that might have reverberant effects um
  and that I think that concept I think it's very core to the way that again we do
  science the way that we integrate information like if whatever this node was was
  turned out to be based on come on you can do it yeah this is user ID whatever 112
  6223 or whatever and say this is all the research that that that user scientist
  had done and all of the the links that it connects to are is sort of the things
  that they have contributed to the Web of Knowledge and then we find out that this
  person was a fraud and they were actually falsifying all of their data and all of
  these things are now are now sort of suspect we have to delete this node then we
  have to sort of figure out what how much of the rest of these things can stand on
  their own versus how much them actually rely on that person's thing um and I mentioning
  that in terms of like the human like falsification of science which is never great
  um falsifying research but that's also true about how theories evolve and um you
  got your yeah your who's it uh Thomas Paradigm Shift structure of scientific revolutions
  things like that um which we're not going to talk about because I'm already getting
  distracted but I like graphs and nodes and look at it go but um yeah and I think
  running a little yeah and so this yeah the markdown folder and so we have all of
  our different things we have so by server so and the top level is categories and
  then the channel and then these are all of the uh conversations that came out of
  that it takes a second to load I should close this um and so these are so this is
  someone who was asking about oh this is not a good choice let's say reflex balance
  and ear infection so someone asking about ear infections and how that could affect
  balance the answer is uh it can for sure like that's part vular system gets involved
  there and hopefully the bot said something similar yeah vestibular rehab the therapy
  yep there you go and so these are the tags that show up and then the back links
  I think don't work so don't if you click on them doesn't work and then this is that
  whole conversation there um and I'll come and then so this is and so the by topic
  is the new one so there are a bunch of these um and so each one of these tags is
  let's look at something let's look at sads and going show up there you go and so
  this one the tag link count as nine so there were nine chats that got that earned
  the sakad tag and then there you go so this is the Wikipedia style uh article that
  the bot generated and I think I included yeah these are links to the chat again
  the CL the links don't work so but the names are accurate so you can search for
  the name to find it um and this would have been the users that that had the tag
  but that part also didn't work um and yeah and then we can do groups new group file
  say there there so all the red ones are the are the by topic one oh wait and then
  file uh user and all of the let's see what color should these be magenta and these
  ones should be freaking blue so all of the magenta ones are are y'all guys the users
  so you can search for yourself in here um the ID is your Discord ID so just right
  click your name and get the user ID and you can search for it um and so this is
  good old 12831 da da d736 just take the last like six digits you can search for
  that that's going to be just as you is the whole thing for these purposes um but
  this is a person uh who hopefully had something to say order is a little bit weird
  here how do I do that yeah so this this person participated in 10 conversations
  um on these various topics and I have a suspicion that a lot of these are going
  to show up a little more generic than they want because kind of like a the smear
  effect that happens when you just lump everything together um but this is hypothetically
  a summary of whoever this person is um this is an overview of what their interests
  are what they're sort of looking at and um as I said there sort of like the iterative
  nature of teaching a class like this uh this is the kind of thing that I wish I
  could have done throughout the entire semester um and sort of like provide this
  sort of automatically as you go and sort of develop this kind of of like understanding
  of what each of you are interested in and sort of trying to sort of you know Steer
  and group and lump and sort of things lump you all lump you together and stuff like
  that based off of this information but unfortunately the sort of as is often the
  case in open source software the vibe is better than it's ever been and worse than
  it will ever be so you have gotten the best version of this class that has existed
  up until this point and with any luck you've also gotten the worst version of this
  class that will ever exist so of going forward so hopefully it was viable within
  that bound um yeah so yeah so I'm gonna so that's so so first things first I think
  would be to find the the topics that you're interested in and then just find yourself
  uh in this thing and sort of you know look at what it found about you look at what
  it thought you were doing uh look at what it said your interests were versus what
  you're actually into um and yeah we'll sort of come back to that in a second uh
  and yeah so the last thing I wanted to show you is something that is on the scale
  of for more just like fun and a little bit horrifying which is image generation
  um one of the things that these AIS can do is generate kind of like unsettlingly
  horrific imagery um particularly on the topic of biology which I have at this point
  you have you've seen it you if you I think one of the main things this class is
  sort of like the undercurrent of this is like learning how to use AI learning how
  to use it to explore things and hopefully in in Tangent learning how to recognize
  AI speech and AI text like it has a certain smell to it and you can sort of start
  to learn you probably you've already started to internalize and you should continue
  to internalize what it feels like to talk to something that is not a human being
  um and sort of this the the general the the philosophical term it's the grounding
  problem like the sort of the the in the the the slightly sort of floaty nature of
  the conversations and it's like it's just as willing to say something that's totally
  reasonable and something that's absolutely Bonkers out the wall because you are
  talking to a statistical blob of numbers when you when you have these conversations
  and so learning how to recognize the differences there I think is just a useful
  life skill and similarly um the pictures that they generate when you it's strangely
  almost the exact same technology um that generates the images as generates the text
  it's just in two Dimensions instead of one um but learning how to you like at this
  point you've seen them every everywhere and the question is do you just were you
  aware that you were looking at AI generated imagery um and I'm just trying to find
  one so at this point I'm just going to go to this one this was a conversation from
  Caroline with 14 messages in it so I assume you talked about something interesting
  I talked about that and so in any chat in any place uh every time you do this it
  cost me 4 cents so be mindful of that um I haven't quite gotten to the point of
  running that locally but uh Slash image um and you can give it a prompt but there's
  a default prompt that just says like make a picture from this text then use context
  you want to set that to True um so context is like the place that you're in so if
  I hit this button then it's going to send something to Dolly 3 so yeah so it pulled
  the text it comes up with this sort of like visualized description and then in a
  second it will produce something or it won't we'll see there you go there you go
  and a picture based off of the conversation that happened they're probably a lot
  going to look like this and this is actually not a very offensive brain off this
  is an offensive brain this is not what they and this is not how that works but um
  you can also do let's go to a different one um this is another 14 one from Sal matu
  so uh images and I'm going to give it a prompt and say um focus I don't know add
  Dolphins to the te imagery Dolphins just to see if it's working and then use context
  as true and then it will do the same thing it did before except now it will presumably
  have some kind of a dolphy theme to it so so yeah please do that any conversation
  that you've been a part of that seems fun any when you just want to do that do it
  in the bot playground uh you can also if you don't use context you can just do image
  generation and just tell it show me yeah there you go it doesn't really know I don't
  know I think this was a conversation about Parkinson's so this is a bunch of happy
  horrifying older ladies with brain hats and then dolphins and look at them go look
  how happy they are so another thing I really hope that you can get from this is
  that these are not brains you should be horrified at the biology of what it thinks
  a brain looks like um do right here and just say image um prompt show me the neurom
  motor hierarchy key and then I'm I'm not going to give it the context we'll just
  see what shows up probably something terrible um but yeah so you can play around
  with that uh I am I'll probably put some kind of limit on because the the text doesn't
  really cost any money the image does just because it's a bigger computation um it
  costs 4 cents I at some point we'll have it running locally so it won't cost me
  any money uh I have we doing it can't do words so it does these horrible things
  and it's kind of like the term here is uncanny it's close but this is not that's
  not this person is not doing okay um things are backwards this the a lot of the
  parts that need to exist aren't there but like you can kind of recognize where it
  came from like hopefully like you can you know there's some uh what's the sympathetic
  trunk stuff going on here that is the cerebellum this is the wants to be the cerebellum
  that's the medulla ablang that's the cortex but the details are off uh and neuromotor
  it's just it's like try it's like getting in a fight in your dreams it's like not
  the parts don't really connect um if I was a different kind of teacher I would have
  like assignments that involved labeling all the things that are wrong with images
  like that but I'm not that type of a person so do it on your own left ases an exercise
  to the reader and all that um and oh the thing the main thing I was supposed to
  do I actually forgot to do um uh I will I'll pretend like this is ass an assignment
  even though just because I know it's helpful to pretend these type of things I'm
  going to make another Channel um I'll do it by the end of the day and it will be
  a sort of a um a pairing of the introductions channel that you did when you started
  of like asking introducing yourself talking about this that and the other but it'll
  be more of an outro rather than an intro and I will ask you to uh I won't do it
  in class um but I'll do it afterwards and do it if you can um and I'll just ask
  you to like grab your summary plop it in there and then have kind of like an exit
  interview with the bot about like the things that you covered the things you liked
  um and I'll come up with a prompt for that so it'll be sort of you know a semi-guided
  conversation so I'll put it on canvas and it will it it sure will look like an assignment
  un let's pretend like I care about that um and just do it for your own edification
  and also my own um yeah I think that's about that uh so I hope that you enjoy this
  strange experience uh we're not ready to leave quite yet um I think in the uh yeah
  in the remainder of this time laun you let's like pull up your stuff pull up the
  the um you know the final scraping um look at the things that it was talking to
  you about talk to your amongst your friends about it um and I'll come back through
  and sort of chat through stuff until class is over in 35 minutes so uh I suppose
  this concludes the part of the course where I stand up here and talk to you so I
  hope you have enjoyed everything up to and including this percentage of the course
  um thanks for uh showing up participating and yeah being I don't know how happily
  willing you were but you were at least uh no one complained too loudly at the strange
  and wacky structure of this course I hope you got something out of it um hope you
  enjoyed seeing a little bit about how the sausage is made as they say and uh yeah
  I hope to see you all around so thank you for that and with that I will turn off
  the recorder and call it a semester almost I still there's like 35 minutes left
  but no record of that will exist so bye

  text: okay hello everybody and welcome to the last class of the semester uh right
    right okay good yeah so went very fast um yeah so thanks for showing up uh thanks
    for sticking around um there's no final you're all good um and today I'm mostly
    going to be talking about uh sort of some wrapup stuff I'll be presenting my final
    project which I hope will be to your approval uh my final project is making sense
    of the massive gobs of text yall put into the machine um and sort of thinking
    about what that looks like uh I've it pulls out i' I've have something that pulls
    out like sort of like a weird report for each of you based on just like this person
    has been talking about these things and then uh I don't think I'll take up nearly
    the entire class so my intention is sort of like situate to that situate yall
    to to that data show you some little fun things I just added to the machine um
    and then yeah and then for the rest of the for the sort of remainder of the time
    I sort of do this sort of small group thing and sort of uh you can like look over
    what the bot think you're into um sort of talk about it in your little group uh
    I'll come around and sort of like chat with you a bit about what's going on there
    um and then we'll be roughly good uh I'm also going to talk a little bit about
    if you're interested in this type of thing the research that I do in my life and
    in my lab and that kind of stuff we'll talk about a couple Avenues you can take
    to involve yourself in the future coming semesters and all that um so let's see
    what order should I do this end let's do the the boring oh I also want to do like
    a quick uh tutorial on how to set up your own Skelly bot server because it's very
    easy to do so it's just a couple of clicks and um you can have your own version
    of this thing and run it until I until I shut it down at which point um which
    I don't know probably won't be very soon because I'm still I'm going to be working
    on it continuously um so we're going to do that uh before the second half a class
    so if anyone has questions want to set that up uh you can do so um don't use it
    to cheat but it's no different than any other AI thing and so I don't feel like
    I'm giving you any forbidden Weaponry that wouldn't already be available so yeah
    I'll good by that um so

  text: yeah let's start with the procedural stuff so if you want to if you're curious
    about this type of research this sort of General domain and you would like to
    keep um affiliated with the weird stuff I do in my life um the easiest way to
    do that is To Join This Server which is the research server that I run um in for
    my lab and research and you errands in there and there's a an accumulation of
    other students from various iterations of My Life um it's human research lab sort
    of like a play it's not a play it's just a sort of weird acronym of human movement
    neuroscience and the specific tag that I put for Northeastern students is numans
    NE m o n just because it's funny um so I will take this uh how do I that invite
    people uh edit invite never expire generate New Link copy that link go to our
    server go to I guess announcements uh if you want to join my research lab server
    click here and then you can do that so you click that you'll pop up in the server
    and then you know it's used kind of in a function way so um it might be sort of
    like conversations you're just jumping into the middle of um but I'll make announcements
    there about like what the general like on campus sort of I have like an Open Lab
    meeting type of thing that I do um and I'll put the schedule there and in general
    mostly also in specific um the oncampus lab thing that I do is always open invite
    and it's always like open schedule so if if there's like a time period that it's
    going on and you can only show up for part of that time show up for part of that
    time you don't need to ask to show up if you show up in a year and a half well
    I may not be here but if you show up in a 6 months um whe you don't have to announce
    it just show up it'll be good um and the other place you can go wait who's in
    The Voice channel here is it me oh somebody somebody accidentally joined the voice
    channel uh to exit you click on this thing where is it uh somebody else d The
    Voice Channel you'll figure it out uh the other place if you're curious about
    specifically the free moap side of this thing free moap is the moap mapy thing
    we did at the beginning this is the server for that this is a more public facing
    thing um last I checked there were 2500 some odd folks in there um hanging out
    sort of a roughly at this point I think pretty even mix between

  text: um like students and researchers and Neuroscience robotics clinical stuff
    um and then about an equal mix of animators game designers mostly on the sort
    of Indie side of things so if you're curious about that right here say if you
    want to join the free moap project public server click here and um yeah that's
    the sort of public facing space so if you're curious about that project want to
    get involved want to see what's going on there um lot more going on in that space
    um you know different vibe uh public facing type of thing so you're welcome to
    do that um yeah and then so thinking about next semester uh I don't quite know
    what the schedule's going to be over winter break that's always kind of a grab
    bag but um in the in the spring semester I will have some kind of a uh lab meeting
    type of thing once a week on campus um it'll mostly be you know me and Aaron meeting
    up and doing stuff and on the research side of things mostly at Richard's 453
    we'll talk about I'll post at some point in the winter break I will post something
    in the schedule there um but I think it sort of depends on what my class schedule
    is which I haven't fully checked yet but it'll be it's I think it'll be something
    on Thursday afternoons when Tuesday or Thursday afternoons but just keep an eye
    out there um and you'll see what's up uh and yeah same kind of basic rules as
    before like the white dots on the channels just means that there has been some
    message posted and a red number means that you have specifically been tagged um
    if you see a red one showing up from the lab server it's because I've probably
    tagged the Numan role which means like open conversation open announcement for
    all any student Affiliated humans um yeah the other thing this is a little more
    um I'm not sure if anyone would be properly into this but I will also make an
    announcement about uh what I'm going to be doing in the class I'm doing next semester
    um so that's going to be a um an inquiry session so it's the first semester freshman
    which y'all presumably all did at some level um it's going to be basically the
    same class except split into twice a week so I'm going to cover mostly the same
    topics just in a shorter form and what I'm going to do is it's going to be sort
    of split half and half for one of the weeks one of the the one of the sessions
    I believe I believe it's Tuesday Thursday and the Tuesday one will be like lectur
    types of stuff and then the Thursday one will be more like researchy types of
    things so talking you know the the the talking to the bot um there'll be more
    time to do like actual data analysis stuff like that cuz
- dur: 180.0
  end: 720.0
  start: 540.0
  text: um I think the way that you're usually do inquiries is like you're supposed
    to present like on a paper at the end of the semester but I do it more like you
    do like a little mini research project so if anyone is interested in the timing
    works out um that will also be kind of like open invite for upper classman types
    who want to show up and have an opportunity to you know dig a little deeper into
    the stuff participate in kind of a more like constrained research project um you
    know help some young freshman figure out what papers are um and youve got you've
    seen how this goes like there's a lot of surface area and there's really not in
    many like if I were to teach this class to a room full of professional researchers
    I would not I would teach it in almost the exact same way that I did like I didn't
    dumb it down for you I won't be dumbing it down for them there's not really a
    way to dumb it down because it's just their surface area is so huge there's really
    nobody that has the sort of the the specific areas of knowledge that I'm teaching
    except for like me and that's just because I'm the one standing up here so um
    with specifically on that research side of things if you wanted to show up you
    would have you know the ability to kind of like you know mix and match and sort
    of help out people as are doing stuff like maybe push some people in certain directions
    to sort of get them to look at things that you care about um and then you know
    they present at the end of the semester um anyone that you helped with you get
    your name on the poster and youa I put like a source thing the student undergrad
    research thing which is a nice way to kind of like pad the resume with a bunch
    of lines of like I helped with research projects and it will be legitimate so
    um you know I don't know if anyone feels like sitting in on an additional class
    for which you will get no credit uh but you might enjoy the experience so I will
    also make that sort of announcement once I know more about what that schedule
    will be um yeah and also similarly like uh I guess will sort of depend cuz the
    I was going to say you can sort of come and go whenever you want throughout the
    semester which is true but also uh it has never been the case that the way the
    class goes is the way that I think it will have gone so uh I'll make an announcement
    it's sort of before the beginning of the semester about what I think the vibe
    will be um and if that shifts just you know I don't know ask about it or who cares
    just show up doesn't matter um yeah oh and on a similar note uh I know that for
    for a lot of y'all's degrees you have to have some kind of a research lab um you
    can also do like independent studies and things like that um I don't know you'd
    have to talk to like the advisor core about what the specific rules are but I
    am opened for a lot of that type of thing I probably don't have a ton of my like
    available time to like do sort of truly independent independent studies but if
    you wanted to do something like that in

  text: order to cover a research credit or however they do that um I'd be happy to
    work something out that would sort of overlap with the stuff I'm doing with the
    inquiries class and sort of find some way that you could pick a project and sort
    of interact that way um because I have heard that it is like a like finding space
    in those research classes can be difficult and often times it's not studying it's
    like the the domain of inquiry may not be what you're particularly interested
    in particularly for the data science minded folks uh yeah okay so there is that
    um also just to note again I think I've said this before but in the resources
    Channel there's a link to this uh playlist of uh YouTube recordings which are
    basically these ones that have been recorded um it's every lecture except for
    one where I screwed it up and the video was corrupted um but you know they're
    available they're online they will be online presumably until you know Google
    dies or The Sun Burns Out whichever comes first um probably Google but we'll see
    uh and yeah so all the things I just said if you want to check in it'll be there
    um the lecture from last time for the majority of you who weren't here is up there
    um and yeah and at some point not now hopefully before the end end of the semester
    hopefully for the end of winter break skybot will have the ability to eat YouTube
    URLs so just kind of give it a URL and it'll pull a transcript and eat it and
    give a sort of summary that way so you could wait you could review what we've
    been going on what's been going on here uh one of the funny things about like
    teaching a class like this using specifically like a techie tool that I have built
    um every class sort of Builds on the functionalities of the previous one so this
    class uh I think the main advant the main thing I completed with this I didn't
    really add any functionality to the bot throughout the course of this semester
    um but I did a lot in terms on like in the back end in terms of like analyzing
    and processing the data and sort of producing these reports we're going to talk
    about so um and I think into the next semester I want to add more ability for
    the bot to kind of pull information into a given chat so if you have like oh here's

    video or a website or you know a massive you know an actual paper um adding functionality
    that the bot will be able to just like you could be in a chat and say like hey
    know about this thing and it'll just like pull it in and then you could ask questions
    about that um so that'll be fun um cool and I'm sure there's questions about that
    that that's what the second half of will be about yeah with

  text: that yeah hope so uh roughly it sort of depends um a lot of this it I like
    that both of those tasks are pretty similar at a certain level it's like adding
    to the context and like particularly for large things it's like there's a vector
    search type of thing that wants to happen otherwise the cont like if you pull
    in like a 300 page document that's so much text it'll kind of like overwhelm the
    conversation so there's stuff you got to do to to make that more efficient um
    and at a certain level like the difference between pulling a transcript from a
    YouTube video and chopping up a PDF um those differences are not that significant
    relative to the just like the core task of like adding that that functionality
    to the the bot itself so um it sort of depends I have other things to do and there
    sort of the ability to judge the scale of a task is an impossible forever task
    so I hope to add stuff like that before next semester but time will tell um but
    if you yeah I mean uh I also intend like the to for at the moment the bot has
    mostly been just like a thing that I make and play with and sort of give to some
    people and some other professors have used it but it hasn't really been a public
    facing project like free moap is um I'm going to start doing that for this project
    starting probably through next semester I want to that to be kind of like a slow
    roll um so that will that will change the vibe a lot it will hopefully become
    something of like a proper open source project um as opposed to like a toy that
    I'm hanging and playing with um and just in general I think like there's some
    very interesting like teaching methods emerging of like you know the stuff we're
    going to talk about shortly about like just this very interesting process of I
    show I can give these incredibly dense lectures and then walk around and have
    y'all all kind of like like whichever part of that Peak your interest you get
    to explore that to um some interest I think there's there's some there's something
    interesting there that I'm curious about keeping the pushing up keeping uh keeping
    uh exploring and then making that available to other educational humans um be
    they teacher types are just like people who like to learn things um incidentally
    I'm kind of talking backwards here but I often do um part of the reason why I
    want to focus on pulling external context into conversations is uh related to
    this sort of like realization that I had when I was doing the final sort of wrapup
    of the kind of like the oroboros nature

    from experience that they were all mostly on point mostly accurate and mostly
    saying like the rightish kind of things but no one's checking the work here like
    and I hope y'all were like look just sort of on your own um but I wasn't like
    I was just was you know like the bot read like I was thinking about like order
    of or like distances from a human and distances from the empirical measurement
    the sort of like this chain of of of reasoning we've talked about lot of research
    settings where it's like you the human asks a question and the bot produces an
    answer and at the end of that you have a conversation where the like these human
    bot couplets and then you summarize that and you say okay here's the summary of
    that conversation you summarize the summaries and okay here's like a report on
    that thing but no one but at some point you're just s like the AI text is analyzing
    the AI text is analyzing the a text and sort of that like it progresses farther
    and F farther from like the real natural world so I think it's not too insane
    to imagine a a setting here where like the bot looks at the questions and goes
    and like pulls some review articles from PubMed and then instead of just like
    saying what it thinks it should say based off of its training it can sort of say
    what it thinks it should say based off its training plus articles pulled from
    humans who have presumably qualified ifications and peer review and empirical
    measurements behind them at some level so yeah with that in mind let's talk about
    let's talk about where we got with this thing okay so as before uh in the resources
    channel in the sort of there's she won't look like that for you there's this server
    scrape checkpoints and the back the last one here is the last one I intend to
    produce um and yeah but before before we go into that oh I leared how to do this
    didn't I is it forward or backwards to pull it out I remember yeah it was yeah
    I could remember if it was pull it out or push it in okay so quick overview of
    like the basic algorithm that happened so so here's you you're a human congratulations
    and then here's the bot it's doing its best that that's the interational sign
    for bot um and so you ask a question and the bot

  text: produces an answer whatever and then we have a couple of those and then we're
    going to call this a chat or a thread or a conversation right so this is sort
    of the basic unit that you've been producing um this whole time and there's this
    there are these linked Blobs of text representing human question I mean I know
    there were different it wasn't always like question answer it was a lot of question
    answer but you know human query bot response human query bot response uh and each
    one of these things is a chat so then we have and so like the the structural aspect
    of this is like you have the server which is the Discord server the the Discord
    server has categories which is the things like the the lectures and the body the
    bodies and the eyeballs and stuff like that we didn't really wind up using a lot
    of this structure other than the lectures thing um but that's okay and then within
    that each category has a certain set of channels channels are named again like
    there's a prompting thing that can happen that again we didn't really use very
    much of um so but that's okay and then within each of these categories each of
    these are chats and each of the chats has as sort of messages here right and so
    these are the sort of the basic units of of the conversation um let's see do I
    have the numbers here this is one of the things where it's like like what you're
    seeing is what I got done I'm sure you are familiar with working under a deadline
    and the difference between the things you hope you can get done and things that
    actually get done is often quite dramatic um but like this is one like oh I should
    know things like we had this many chats and this many words and this many things
    uh I don't know those numbers at the top of my head they might just be shoved
    in here at some place um but the answer it was a lot very the word count was High
    um like mostly bot talk um in terms of like you know human produced text versus
    bot produced text the bot talked a lot more it you know cuz asking a question
    like what is the cortical spinal tract is not very many words the convers but
    the thing that it says is often quite a lot um I'm just going to see if it's see
    what it be think I can do that is that work yeah don't think it's going to give
    me to me

    like functional text so I don't really have those hard numbers there um okay so
    so most of the things that we've been showing so far um like when I would sort
    of produce these checkpoints you load them into obsidian um the analyses that
    we were looking at was basically iterating through each of these chats and so
    for every the server there were three categories bunch of channels bunch of chats
    and so You' get like these sort of units of chat and we would I would basically
    feed them back into uh gbt 40 um which is the same llm that's driving Skelly bot
    the main main guy um and it would do things like produce like a summary um highlights
    or whatever and then importantly um it would produce these tags which were the
    sort of hashtag topic whatever thing um and that's most and up until this point
    that's what we had we had a bunch of summaries AI analyses of the chats themselves
    um I added in this round um so you might consider this kind of like a first order
    summary because you're going through each conversation we'll call this like zeroth
    order because like it's human to bot you know each time and then this sort of
    chat summary is kind of like a first order analysis of that so we're going over
    we're lumping up all the conversations we're looking at what's going on in there
    um but there's nothing that we can do at this level that will com that will group
    across different conversations each one of these measurements is are is sort of
    in is sort of independent of anything else that might be going on in the server
    um so now there are two additional categories uh one is by user and another is
    by topic so by user that's all of you guys so basically at that point what I did
    is I um I cycled through all of the conversations I I iterated through each one
    of you so every uh ID that showed up in the Discord server um and then I iterated
    through all of the available chats I think there were like 300 and some OD of
    these I can't remember exactly what the number was um and I grouped all of the
    chats that you as an individual person contributed to and I counted any chat where
    you sent a single message was a chat that you were a part of um and

  text: so then I pulled this was a place that I really should have done I could have
    done a little bit extra work here but I ran the exact same summary on on this
    so you get this sort of again the formatting is a little weird because the formatting
    is the same as the one for the chats but you get like an AI sort of generated
    summary of all of the things that you know this person you know summary topics
    tags and so this is kind of the report about yourself um I don't fully trust that
    it's going to do a good job because if you had a lot of conversations um then
    that's a lot of text and so saying hey summarize this very very long text you
    get just kind of wonky results there and the main thing that you see is there's
    a huge um what's the word like initialization bias like the first text that it
    receives is it's over repes presented in the summary so if if the first conversation
    you had was about dogs and then you had a bunch of other conversations about things
    that aren't dogs the summary is going to say this person really likes dogs um
    just by the nature of that there's ways of getting around that but they're more
    sophisticated than what I did so you're going to have you get what you get there
    um the other thing was by topic so I went through and grabbed each of the tags
    um from all of the summaries uh I think not just the chats I didn't look at the
    tags presumably yeah presumably there no there shouldn't be many additional tags
    showing up here because the sort of the list of all users um is just a complete
    reshuffling of the the server structure like all the chats that are in the server
    are also here I think it might be duplications there because if you participate
    in the same one um and so I went through and I found found all of the tags uh
    that showed up in any conversation in any summary of any conversation um and there
    were like roughly 1,500 of them so uh again that the number is a little bit dependent
    on like the prompting that was used to generate them um but there were roughly
    1500 tags that showed up in all, 1500 sort of unique tags that showed up in all
    of the conversations of the entire server um many of which were kind of like redundant
    so you have like one is like ACL recovery and the other one is ACL repair those
    are two tags and they really should be one um but uh so what I did is I I went
    through these and rather than producing something for every single tag I only
    produced uh documents for tags that had a rank of at least five um where rank
    means the number of times that they're mentioned so every tag that showed up in
    at least five

  text: conversations got this special treatment um and that one a little bit different
    from this summary I I asked it to make a Wikipedia style article um so I grabbed
    I grabbed the topics let's say I don't know biomech uh and I grabbed every thread
    that mentioned that had this tag in it and I grouped all of these together and
    I sent it to a prompt that said create an create a Wikipedia style article about
    this and the prompt I made there was literally I went to the Wikipedia style guide
    copied the whole thing gave it to the bot and said make a good prompt out of this
    style guide it made a pretty good one and then now we have that so we have so
    yeah so that is what we're about to see is this something will look very similar
    um B Bally everything we have been seeing up until this point is going to be under
    a folder called by server obviously and then there's going to be two additional
    ones that's by topic and then by user where user is synonymous for student um
    yeah totally makes sense I'm sure everyone's following fully this is one of those
    things that like a lot of that explanation was for me and for anyone curious about
    what's about to show up so as before I don't know which one that one is from um
    let's see so in downloads okay yeah and this is one of those places where like
    there was a lot of work that happened that is just going to be completely invisible
    from the outside because there was a lot of stuff that a you're just never going
    to see because it was about organization and like the ability to do this amount
    of nonsense and have it be reasonable and have any kind of confidence about what's
    going on there it's mostly an organizational task um you'll also never see all
    the things that were tried and never completed and sort of like you know dead
    ends and stuff like that so say lovey uh okay so download the thing open the zip
    go into obsidian it should be hold hat at this point um open the thing um the
    markdown folder is the one with all the actual documents in it the other ones

    unlike before there's actually links between the Articles the Articles now so
    it doesn't show anything so it shows up as some links here and then this is if
    you add the tags and look at all those weird guys um we have definitely at this
    point overwhelmed what obsidian was intended for uh there's also one of the things
    I tried and didn't quite get working is sort of building out a better like 3D
    version of this so you can rotate it never quite got that working but you can
    so in obsidian the little gear box at the pro at the bottom click that go to community
    plugins turn on community plugins browse 3D I think this none of these are quite
    what I want them to be um but they're better than what I have which is nothing
    I just search for 3D and I just turn on the top three because they're all uh not
    quite what I want in slightly different ways so you can at least look at them
    and mostly it's just this is not going to be like useful it's just going to be
    like oh look uh so those show up do that one so this one is fun be it doesn't
    this is just a thing it doesn't show the tags but it kind of you can start to
    see like how some of these things work so like Neuroscience is attached to everything
    uh something movement is attached to many things and a lot these other ones just
    aren't linked right mostly because they didn't generate the the tags the links
    properly um this one's a little better it also doesn't show tags someone gets
    a special place in my heart because they plotted the XYZ in the origin there um
    it does a better job of showing the the titles um but it also doesn't show the
    the tags this one shows the tags but it's also a bit of a horror show someone
    got too excited about Bloom which is that brightness effect and then there commands
    here display control you can turn the Bloom down but not off so but it does show
    the route the tags um it's in green I believe uh yeah so that one oh this one's
    by user so again there's not much more to say about this um about about this representation
    of this the graph structure other than to kind of just note um the the general

    particularly functionally organized this is representative of this is the shape
    of your Collective curiosity about the topic of human movement neuroscience and
    if you were to click through which we will in a second here you would see a bunch
    of different conversations hundreds of different conversations of each of you
    asking some kinds of questions about some kinds of things that you want wanted
    to know more about and although there's you know the topic itself constrains the
    questions to some extent um and if I were to teach this class again um with a
    bunch of different people you would see a lot of overlap in the questions that
    were asked but it wouldn't be complete overlap if it was a different room full
    of people you would have asked different questions and then the results would
    have different components here um and there's something I think really neat about
    that uh I remember at one point in the semester after I think the motor hierarchy
    uh lecture um right you know gave a very dense run through of a bunch of different
    parts of your nervous system um I remember went going around to talk to people
    after that and you were talking to the bot and every single group that I talked
    to was asking about something different um there was no overlap between the things
    that you were curious about which was really cool and really surprising to me
    like you know you kind of expect it's like oh they're all going to be interested
    in this they're all going to be interested in that but every one of you was interested
    in something different about that lecture and because of the the friendly machine
    um you're all able to explore that uh curiosity in a way that was constrained
    by the by the lecture constrained by the topic constrained by the reality of having
    of the human nervous system but shaped specifically by the questions that you
    asked and the sort of the Curiosities that you brought to the table um and that's
    something I think that's very indicative of a lot of the world and a lot of the
    way that we do scientific research like to some extent there is this I think very
    incorrect view of science that it is it's an objective thing and that there's
    no human element to it and you hear people say things like oh if we deleted all
    the scientific textbooks in a thousand years we'd have the same textbooks and
    that's not entirely false it's there would certainly be like we would discover
    the same things we would discover that there's a spinal cord and that there's
    a big lumpy pink thing on top um and we would discover things like Rodman's areas
    and that the occipital that this is where the vision stuff happens but the the
    concepts that that evolve and sort of arise from scientific research are shaped
    by the people that do the the researching they and the the the the the terms and
    terminology and sort of like um Frameworks that we develop they're human things
    that we create in order to help us understand the world that we're

    rules about sort of the things you can say but it's a very human endeavor and
    it's something that I think is really important to think about um this is also
    not directly related to this but there's this concept in philosophy of science
    which I think is one of the more Core Concepts of uh the it's called the the quinian
    web of belief um in wvo Quin is the guy um but the idea is that your knowledge
    of the world you as an individual you as a collective you as a culture as a community
    as a species your beliefs about the world are interconnected webs of beliefs and
    the little then each part of it is overlaps with everything else and when you
    are going out and trying to explore new things and learn new knowledge um when
    you learn some new piece of information that information has to be integrated
    into that web of the of all the things that you believe about the world and if
    that if the new piece of knowledge is consistent with that web then that's no
    problem you put it in there you tag it to other things and then you're You Now
    understand the world better if there's a conflict between you go out and you learn
    some new fact and then you try to put it in your web of belief and it doesn't
    fit or it it overlaps or it conflicts with something else the you have to choose
    to either reject the new fact and say this must not be true or you have to go
    in and prune your tree and figure out the things that this contradicts are those
    things is it what's the cost there is it more costly to reject the new fact or
    is it more costly to shift around the tree and change things in ways that might
    have reverberant effects um and that I think that concept I think it's very core
    to the way that again we do science the way that we integrate information like
    if whatever this node was was turned out to be based on come on you can do it
    yeah this is user ID whatever 112 6223 or whatever and say this is all the research
    that that that user scientist had done and all of the the links that it connects
    to are is sort of the things that they have contributed to the Web of Knowledge
    and then we find out that this person was a fraud and they were actually falsifying
    all of their data and all of these things are now are now sort of suspect we have
    to delete this node then we have to sort of figure out what how much of the rest
    of these things can stand on their own versus how much them actually rely on that
    person's thing um and I mentioning that in terms of like the human like falsification
    of science which is never great um falsifying research but that's also true about
    how theories evolve and um you got your yeah your who's it uh Thomas

    so someone asking about ear infections and how that could affect balance the answer
    is uh it can for sure like that's part vular system gets involved there and hopefully
    the bot said something similar yeah vestibular rehab the therapy yep there you
    go and so these are the tags that show up and then the back links I think don't

    so there are a bunch of these um and so each one of these tags is let's look at

    generated and I think I included yeah these are links to the chat again the CL
    the links don't work so but the names are accurate so you can search for the name

    is a person uh who hopefully had something to say order is a little bit weird
    here how do I do that yeah so this this person participated in 10 conversations
    um on these various topics and I have a suspicion that a lot of these are going
    to show up a little more generic than they want because kind of like a the smear
    effect that happens when you just lump everything together um but this is hypothetically
    a summary of whoever this person is um this is an overview of what their interests
    are what they're sort of looking at and um as I said there sort of like the iterative
    nature of teaching a class like this uh this is the kind of thing that I wish
    I could have done throughout the entire semester um and sort of like provide this
    sort of automatically as you go and sort of develop this kind of of like understanding
    of what each of you are interested in and sort of trying to sort of you know Steer
    and group and lump and sort of things lump you all lump you together and stuff
    like that based off of this information but unfortunately the sort of as is often
    the case in open source software the vibe is better than it's ever been and worse
    than it will ever be so you have gotten the best version of this class that has
    existed up until this point and with any luck you've also gotten the worst version
    of this class that will ever exist so of going forward so hopefully it was viable
    within that bound um yeah so yeah so I'm gonna so that's so so first things first
    I think would be to find the the topics that you're interested in and then just
    find yourself uh in this thing and sort of you know look at what it found about
    you look at what it thought you were doing uh look at what it said your interests
    were versus what you're actually into um and yeah we'll sort of come back to that

    is sort of like the undercurrent of this is like learning how to use AI learning
    how to use it to explore things and hopefully in in Tangent learning how to recognize
    AI speech and AI text like it has a certain smell to it and you can sort of start
    to learn you probably you've already started to internalize and you should continue
    to internalize what it feels like to talk to something that is not a human being
    um and sort of this the the general the the philosophical term it's the grounding
    problem like the sort of the the in the the the slightly sort of floaty nature
    of the conversations and it's like it's just as willing to say something that's
    totally reasonable and something that's absolutely Bonkers out the wall because
    you are talking to a statistical blob of numbers when you when you have these
    conversations and so learning how to recognize the differences there I think is
    just a useful life skill and similarly um the pictures that they generate when
    you it's strangely almost the exact same technology um that generates the images
    as generates the text it's just in two Dimensions instead of one um but learning
    how to you like at this point you've seen them every everywhere and the question
    is do you just were you aware that you were looking at AI generated imagery um
    and I'm just trying to find one so at this point I'm just going to go to this
    one this was a conversation from Caroline with 14 messages in it so I assume you
    talked about something interesting I talked about that and so in any chat in any
    place uh every time you do this it cost me 4 cents so be mindful of that um I
    haven't quite gotten to the point of running that locally but uh Slash image um
    and you can give it a prompt but there's a default prompt that just says like
    make a picture from this text then use context you want to set that to True um
    so context is like the place that you're in so if I hit this button then it's
    going to send something to Dolly 3 so yeah so it pulled the text it comes up with
    this sort of like visualized description and then in a second it will produce
    something or it won't we'll see there you go there you go and a picture based
    off of the conversation that happened they're probably a lot going to look like
    this and this is actually not a very offensive brain off this is an offensive
    brain this is not what they and this is not how that works but um you can also
    do let's go to a different one um this is another 14 one from Sal matu so

  text: uh images and I'm going to give it a prompt and say um focus I don't know
    add Dolphins to the te imagery Dolphins just to see if it's working and then use
    context as true and then it will do the same thing it did before except now it
    will presumably have some kind of a dolphy theme to it so so yeah please do that
    any conversation that you've been a part of that seems fun any when you just want
    to do that do it in the bot playground uh you can also if you don't use context
    you can just do image generation and just tell it show me yeah there you go it
    doesn't really know I don't know I think this was a conversation about Parkinson's
    so this is a bunch of happy horrifying older ladies with brain hats and then dolphins
    and look at them go look how happy they are so another thing I really hope that
    you can get from this is that these are not brains you should be horrified at
    the biology of what it thinks a brain looks like um do right here and just say
    image um prompt show me the neurom motor hierarchy key and then I'm I'm not going
    to give it the context we'll just see what shows up probably something terrible
    um but yeah so you can play around with that uh I am I'll probably put some kind
    of limit on because the the text doesn't really cost any money the image does
    just because it's a bigger computation um it costs 4 cents I at some point we'll
    have it running locally so it won't cost me any money uh I have we doing it can't
    do words so it does these horrible things and it's kind of like the term here
    is uncanny it's close but this is not that's not this person is not doing okay
    um things are backwards this the a lot of the parts that need to exist aren't
    there but like you can kind of recognize where it came from like hopefully like
    you can you know there's some uh what's the sympathetic trunk stuff going on here
    that is the cerebellum this is the wants to be the cerebellum that's the medulla
    ablang that's the cortex but the details are off uh and neuromotor it's just it's
    like try it's like getting in a fight in your dreams it's like not the parts don't
    really connect um if I was a different kind of teacher I would have like assignments
    that involved labeling all the things that are wrong with images like that but
    I'm not that type of a person so do it on

  text: your own left ases an exercise to the reader and all that um and oh the thing
    the main thing I was supposed to do I actually forgot to do um uh I will I'll
    pretend like this is ass an assignment even though just because I know it's helpful
    to pretend these type of things I'm going to make another Channel um I'll do it
    by the end of the day and it will be a sort of a um a pairing of the introductions
    channel that you did when you started of like asking introducing yourself talking
    about this that and the other but it'll be more of an outro rather than an intro
    and I will ask you to uh I won't do it in class um but I'll do it afterwards and
    do it if you can um and I'll just ask you to like grab your summary plop it in
    there and then have kind of like an exit interview with the bot about like the
    things that you covered the things you liked um and I'll come up with a prompt
    for that so it'll be sort of you know a semi-guided conversation so I'll put it
    on canvas and it will it it sure will look like an assignment un let's pretend
    like I care about that um and just do it for your own edification and also my
    own um yeah I think that's about that uh so I hope that you enjoy this strange
    experience uh we're not ready to leave quite yet um I think in the uh yeah in
    the remainder of this time laun you let's like pull up your stuff pull up the
    the um you know the final scraping um look at the things that it was talking to
    you about talk to your amongst your friends about it um and I'll come back through
    and sort of chat through stuff until class is over in 35 minutes so uh I suppose
    this concludes the part of the course where I stand up here and talk to you so
    I hope you have enjoyed everything up to and including this percentage of the
    course um thanks for uh showing up participating and yeah being I don't know how
    happily willing you were but you were at least uh no one complained too loudly
    at the strange and wacky structure of this course I hope you got something out
    of it um hope you enjoyed seeing a little bit about how the sausage is made as
    they say and uh yeah I hope to see you all around so thank you for that and with
    that I will turn off the recorder and call it a semester almost I still there's
    like 35 minutes left but no record of that will exist so bye
