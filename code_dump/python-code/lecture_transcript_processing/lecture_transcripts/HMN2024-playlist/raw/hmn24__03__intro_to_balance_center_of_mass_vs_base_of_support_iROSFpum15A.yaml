full_transcript: okay great hello so welcome to October um if you already had one
  of those but welcome to October 8th uh so yeah so the So today we're going to talk
  about balance in center of mass and Bas of support and talk about that kind of thing
  and then after about an hour of talking about that kind of stuff we're gonna do
  some group stuff again but there's going to be um sort of like our first kind of
  technical split option um so if you are a person who is interested in code and programming
  and that type of thing um you'll have the opportunity to kind of split off and work
  on that kind of thing if you're not interested in that you can hang out and we'll
  do more like lit review types of stuff um if you've never done it but are curious
  then you're interested in it interested is not experi that's a separate thing um
  so uh the first thing I want to sort of show before we get into the meet is like
  this some this thing that's going to be kind of like a a rolling kind of checkpoint
  throughout the semester which is the AI weird aspect of this class where I have
  now the first instance of an example of scraping the server so basically pulling
  all of the chats that you've been having with the bot um effectively that like markdown
  text file that gets attached to the top of each chat I pull that out run it through
  the AI say summarize this pull out the main points and Main topics and then basically
  do that for like each chat and each Channel and each category and then the whole
  server and the idea is to sort of use that to try to get a sense of um like what
  you guys are working on what you're interested in and for now it's kind of like
  it's just descriptive so it's just like y'all are doing what you do and then this
  is sort of pull and you can look at it if you want um but one of the things we're
  going to do in that second half of class is sort of starting to steer this a little
  bit so say what are some things that seem to be coming up for a lot of people and
  like can we sort of get more details about those topics um can I look at that and
  say oh they're really interested in this thing when we talk about that next lecture
  that kind of sort of more of a feedback type of thing so um it's so the thing is
  a ZIP file so if you download it it will go to your uh downloads folder whatever
  that may be for you so you can unzip that so that it's just a regular fer your oh
  come on now is it giving you all that invalid thing um so it's here uh so in the
  server in the resources Channel at the top there's a thread called server scrape
  checkpoints and there's a zip file and I am totally happy saying that this checkpoint
  is the zip file is corrupted and we'll figure that out later cool so if you can
  figure it out great if not um it's a bunch of basically like poorly formatted summaries
  of the things You' been talking about and we just call this uh foreshadowing um
  there's a couple other things in that resources Channel too that I added uh one
  is this link up here to a YouTube playlist of these videos um except for last one's
  video because I forgot to save it um I forgot to hit save at the end of this and
  I wasn't saving to a video format that is forgiving of closing the thing mid recording
  so that video was lost rip lost data it happens um and then so yeah and then yeah
  that's another one of those like maybe we'll get to the thing where I can scrape
  the video and pull the transcript and get the topics out put that into the but we'll
  see about that um there's also this link to another playlist called AI stuff where
  I talk about things like building Skelly bot and like using it in classroom settings
  like this so if you're interested in that kind of like meta AI edte stuff watch
  that um yeah and then the third thing I added to the server is in this lectures
  category over here um this one down here which the string of numbers is the date
  so 2024 108 just a way to write your date concisely that's called little endian
  meaning the little things are the end of the number so de earth big big Indian little
  Indian that's what that means if you ever come across that again uh compsite people
  might no one else will um in that I put a link to an outline of what I'm going to
  talk about today which is some tur notes work these links don't work um but maybe
  you can figure it out they're over here okay um cool well so far don't really give
  you any option Cho um um yeah so obsidian calls folders vaults okay uh and so you
  want to be opening that folder as a vault okay uh if you feel like playing with
  that stuff go to any chat and just download the mbb stands for markdown it's the
  thing that turns this looking text into this looking text so you just type it out
  in the raw and then if it's MD and thing that you're looking at knows how to process
  markdown files it turns it into that um so download any the chat at the top um or
  download this that markdown I feel is the sort of the seed of the resol Revolution
  because it is we have just generally internalized this idea that like text is like
  Microsoft or Google when it really really isn't like text is like a behavior that
  you do on a keyboard and we want it to look nice but this is the raw that we actually
  care about is this and so it's also the first sort of entry point to like hey there's
  such a thing as interpreted text you type this thing the computer knows how to make
  it pretty um and uh yeah also uh Google Aaron Schwarz if you don't know who that
  is he's one of the people who sort of came up with the original definitions for
  markdown and uh you should look up who he is and then steal every paper ever published
  a lot of profess be like be careful don't go to HUB or you'll accidentally steal
  papers I'm telling you explicitly go to scub steal papers steal textbook from libgen
  as a scientist as operating under my academic freedom it is the best thing I can
  do for you to say every publishing industry steal all their data steal all their
  it's yeah they think it's their intellectual property it's not it's ours to steal
  it from them okay so none of that is relevant though um so we've been talking a
  lot about Center of mass I've sort of described it at various levels uh and today
  I've brought a series of props to help present that a eron could you screw that
  together thank you um so part of I think also part of the pattern that's emerging
  is I show up late I set up takes a while I'm frustrated and sweaty uh I eventually
  get it working I give like a little update on like the technical backend and AI
  nonsense I have some sort of like moral outrage moment and then I talk a little
  bit about like philosophy of science and then we get into the actual topic of discussion
  um so this is the philosophy of science part um so I've talked about the the concept
  of reductionism uh which is one of those things where it's like it's such a fundamental
  aspect of the way that we live in this sort of society in the way that we B basically
  the way that we do science in the western tradition is a heavily reductionist tradiction
  meaning that you take a a big complicated thing and you chop it up into tiny tiny
  tiny little pieces um and then you look at those pieces in isolated environments
  and then you you sort of hope that the things that you learn about those small scale
  isolated things will scale up to the larger actual desideratum of your study um
  and generally speaking it does right that's why we do cell biology that's why we
  learn about genetics that's why we learn about particle physics and you know periodic
  tables and stuff like that those are all fundamentally reductionist approaches to
  science um reductionist kind of sounds like an insult but it's not it's just a description
  of of a way of looking at things um the the counter to that doesn't really have
  so defined of a name but I generally sort of think of it as like more of a holism
  where instead of taking the thing that's sort of because the problem that reductionism
  solves is that science is impossible right rule number one can't be done we mere
  primates do not have access to capital T true facts of the world we can only approximate
  it with a bunch of sloppy empirical measurements and then statistics um the problem
  of induction in black swans if want to dig into that ho um and so because we can't
  actually do the thing we want to do which is like have true knowledge of the real
  world we have to cheat and take various sort of side steps and whatnot so the traditional
  Western productionist view of science is chop it up into little pieces and hope
  that those pieces sort of fit together into something that resembles the whole um
  a more holistic approach cheats in a different way where instead of taking the whole
  thing and chopping it up into little more parts and thinking about all those parts
  in isolation you take the whole complicated thing and you kind of just like squish
  it down into what you think or hope is like the minimum possible like the most the
  simplest possible model of that thing that captures the Dynamics of the whole thing
  so things like Center of mass which talked about we'll show some pictures in a second
  um is fundamentally that approach um and I've mentioned before this is like not
  NE this is not something you're likely to find in like specific textbooks this is
  more like things I've cobbled together in my research it's sort of inspired a lot
  by robotics approaches going to look up passive Dynamic Walkers is a classic one
  um art quo uh Andy ruen Steve Collins all those good folks um looked at how sort
  of taking the whole complicated object and then reducing it down to a single point
  Mass um can be very helpful to trying to understand what's going on there um I think
  I forgot to yeah so uh I brought a stick so this stick uh this is like the the the
  middle part of like a floor lamp and I found that on the street I tried use it it
  wasn't didn't really work right um and then I realized that the the middle part
  not only comes apart so I can put it in my backpack and bring it to class I used
  to have like a br stick that I cut at a meter and brought into the class but this
  thing pulls up also very nicely this turns out to be actually one meter long so
  I think somewhere at some Factory someone ordered a bunch of like meter long poles
  and cut them up and then now this is a meter stick um so it is uh aluminum or actually
  I metal and roughly straight it has some extent but we can ignore that and it also
  is in even section so this part here is the geometric center of the stick and if
  I put this little thing here then I can know that that is this is both the geometric
  center of the stick is's also the center of mass of the stick so if I take this
  object I focus on this um so basically if I take this stick and I chop it up into
  like 1 cm sections so there would be 100 in a row and I took the average position
  of each of those points um literally just take the XYZ of this one XYZ of that one
  XYZ of that one add up all the X's add up all the Y's divide them by the number
  of chunks the resulting average Position will be here and it turns out that from
  a point of view of like balance physics that is the point that you need to support
  in order to keep the thing from falling down whoa right um so that is true when
  you're supporting it from the bottom it is also true so this is called Loop pull
  the loop through itself that's called a dirt pitch uh if you pull it through again
  this is called a pric and it tends to and it stays worth this I have trusted my
  life and the Liv of many people I love to uh Nots in various contexts so a press
  I can nicely put over that little yellow spot crank it down so it'll stay and in
  the same way that balancing it from below the center of mass keeps it sort of where
  it needs to be um from the above it's the same basic idea so there's more mass on
  this side than there is on that side so I move it over a little bit and hooray bounce
  right so in this case because this is a uniformly massed object this the geometric
  center of it and the center of mass are the same place yes I also found these on
  the street there's a lot of fun things on the street if you know where to look these
  are like like old school like ankle weights I think like you know put them on your
  ankle I don't know um and this is like carpet pad so it's high friction and if I
  like that okay so I've changed both the geometry and the mass distribution um from
  the point of view so the geometry in the sort of the long axis of this thing hasn't
  actually changed much at all right it's the same length um around the in this particular
  case so for any 3D object you have a long axis you have a middle axis sometimes
  called intermediate axis you have a short axis which is the short one sometimes
  they are symmetric in this case the midle and medium medium are symmetric so get
  that um you can also Google the intermediate axis theorem otherwise known as the
  tennis racket theorem which says that you can spin it around the short axis you
  can spin it around the long axis spin around the middle axis it flips midair not
  relevant but fine there's some cool gifts of people doing stuff on the space station
  but that's not important right now so unsurprising I've changed basically I've changed
  the geometry a little bit not in an important not in a relevant Dimension um but
  I've changed the physics a lot so now this side is much heavier than that side uh
  because so before we were just taking the geometric mean you just take the positions
  of each of those points take the average and it happens to line up with a center
  of mass in this case uh that's not that doesn't work because all of those points
  that I'm adding up are not do not have the same density this is full of sand or
  something I don't really know so I can put the thing over here that's about right
  and there we go so now this is the center of mass so the geometry for our basic
  approximations hasn't changed um but the physics has changed quite a bit and so
  the center of mass has changed and so that balance point has changed both when you're
  supporting it from the bottom and when you're supporting it from the top right basic
  idea um if I wanted to do another one think there's two of them you can here we
  go once again even heavier so I can move it basically all the way over here and
  it's not quite right but now yeah so now it's the center of mass of the whole stick
  system is very close to the the Big Bob at the end notice that the first time I
  moved it I had to move it all the way over here the second time I had to move it
  far less that's because of like torque is a thing this is really hard this is really
  easy when we talk about the muscular skeletal system this will come up again if
  you're curious about how uh notice that my arm also resembles a long stick and my
  shoulder which is the main thing leaving it up is this long and attached right here
  so so it's much more like doing this than doing this so spiler alert your muscle
  muscles are like unbelievably strong relative to the task that they can perform
  because they're operating on a massive mechanical disadvantage that's not important
  right now so yeah okay so this is intuitive Center of mass uh there is a difference
  between the geometric center of a rigid object and the center of mass and Center
  of mass also you'll hear it be called center of gravity those are the same thing
  this is gravity being used in the term like density uh center of gravity just feels
  a little more old school to me or in space like in all contexts that matter for
  us Center of Mass center of gravity are the same thing so if you ever see cogg in
  a paper it's the same thing it's just you know using a different term um yeah Center
  of it's like yeah basically Center of density would be another way to say that but
  that's not quite okay so this is a stick made of trash I found on the street um
  excuse me this is a little wooden fellow and it also has a center of mass which
  I could measure if I wanted to I'm allowed to chop this up but I don't want to um
  but it is here if our friend did one of those oh look it tips over so I have to
  move it sort of more this abdomin area so as you move the mass of your body the
  center of mass shifts like I said last time Center of mass is not a part of your
  body it is a description of your body and if you do one of these types of shape
  the center of mass can be outside of your body so the center Mass is like here because
  it's below that point of rotation it becomes passively stable and I can kind of
  perturbation rejecting which we'll talk about shortly so this would be a link but
  it's not I put over here so so this Center of mass approximation is like I think
  a very important and very useful uh hyper simplification of the full complex object
  um it falls under the general heading of like classical mechanics uh which is a
  part of mechanical engineering if you're kind of find the right building to walk
  into um and it specifically falls under I think it's called the finite element theorem
  which basically says that the that you're allowed to look at the center of mass
  as a as a proxy for the Dynamics of the whole thing so taking this complicated object
  chopping it up into like finite elements and then finite small but not zero um and
  then looking at the mean of those points tells you about the the full um tells you
  things about the Dynamics of the full complex object um and I think that's honestly
  I find that like keys I find helpful to think about that because this is also complex
  it's like gangly um but if you sort of throw it if no matter what you do it still
  follows a nicely ballistic trajectory and you can also use this to show that even
  if it's spinning it will spin around its Center of mass and follow a ballistic trajectory
  so you know each of these Keys is a rigid body they're connected by rigid bodies
  so there's no uh stretch or strain or anything like that in the Ballistic case it
  wouldn't matter but it's do that with people p um so uh in this case I don't know
  how much this stick weighs I know that it's one meter long I don't know how much
  these ankle weights weigh but with if we wanted to we could figure out the mass
  of the weights and units of stick Mass um using this kind of sort of math and sort
  of learn things about the forces at Play and things like that and if we were trying
  if we were controlling this with muscles that information would be very relevant
  to us um if you want to do that for like a human person uh it's so basically I want
  to be able to calculate the center of mass of a person um but how do I get those
  numbers well it turns out uh someone chopped up a bunch of dead people and weighed
  them and we have these anthropometry uh a really common one is winter um uh which
  is from like a biomechanics book and I think these tables here were it shows where
  they came from um I think it was like Air Force data they chopped up kabers and
  looked at the relative densities and did a bunch of statistical analyses and you
  get numbers so this is the geometry of it and so these numbers here like be able
  to read it but .52 H where H is total height of the person so this is estimate of
  sort of relative proportions of different body segments in terms of the just in
  units of height um importantly all the dead people they chopped up were men all
  the dead people they chopped up were old men because they were dead um often there's
  a correlation between age and time um there are newer uh anthropometry tables that
  look at a broader demographic um different genders different sort of um body mass
  indices or whatever um but by and large a lot of those differences are small um
  and relative to the scales that I tend to look at in my research They Don't Really
  shift the numbers that much so just kind of use these because it's a standard and
  it's you know around um so these names here correspond roughly to these guys up
  here and they give you the name of the thing the definition in terms of anatomical
  axes so the foot is defined as the lateral malis to the head of the metatarsal 2
  so malis is that on the outside metatarsal is your uh tole I don't know Al to is
  like it's like your index toe knuckle if that's the thing and then it gives you
  the segment weight as a proportion of total body weight so your hand is roughly
  6% of your body mass if you have standard standard side hands um forearm upper arm
  uh your foot is about that 01 14% seems high but I don't know um your leg is 046
  oh sorry 4% yeah um thigh is 10% and then it gives you like foot and leg is you
  know added up ones above it so in the center of mass calculation I was showing last
  time with the blender thing and that little ball moving around those were calculated
  by using these numbers and we'll talk about that in a little bit but just wanted
  to show roughly where that stuff comes from um I also so some time ago different
  life uh I would I made a bunch of gifts and posted them on Reddit in fact before
  Reddit was it was still a sess pit but it was a different kind of cesspit um and
  basically I would just go and find videos of people doing interesting things and
  then just overlay them with basically Center of mass analyses so this is the hand
  forearm it's a planer view so meaning that it's basically a view from straight down
  one of the x y z axes so you basically get to ignore the 3D aspect of it and just
  focus on the 2D uh the vertical line show the extent of the base of support which
  is basically where his hand is and then the thing to notice is that the center of
  mass always stays within that boundary because it has to because if it didn't would
  fall over and there's a bunch of these um this one is wacky uh so uh so this one
  I was getting fancier so I was actually stabilizing the image and this guy's very
  good at this type of thing so again just always stays there Center basic SP shifts
  ra shifts his hands and see like he's doing see look how screwy this like yeah yeah
  he's a freak um archerd or using Dynamics to sort of Pop himself up but keeping
  it within this range the important thing to know that his hand can only push on
  the ground so if the center of mass ever left those boundaries he cannot pull it
  back he can only push it farther away uh and this one is a a violation of that rule
  so this is balance beam otherwise known as the hardest what what's it in sports
  she does this cool thing but oh no she falls but then she pulls it back in and so
  the the most important part of that video for me is this point right there where
  it does go out but she has a grip on the bar so she can she can pull back in this
  this is the same basic idea the wobble in the center of mass is is uh is noise in
  the estimates all right so those links are all there there's a bunch of them click
  through them you know uh we'll talk about them at some later date perhaps um okay
  so roughly speaking that is so C so the important thing there is Center of mass
  um we did talk and then also this concept of base of support your base of support
  is just like the the shape on the ground of your support surface uh my Bas of support
  is defined by my feet this thing's Bas of support is defined by that little point
  it is not passively stable uh for very um okay so real quick um physics Newton was
  a guy he did a thing uh he among other things is um he came up with this sort of
  theory of mechanics which is embodied by Newton's three laws of motion uh which
  are false and wrong theoretical uh models of reality um this is I think a great
  example of like how wrong theories are still useful um Newton had a theory of reality
  where there was such a thing as position and velocity um and wasn't until far later
  that some guy named Einstein came along and wrote some papers um I really don't
  like like ascribing these thoughts to specific people because really they're just
  the specific humans that wrote it first like people say Newton invented calculus
  but lith also invented calculus at the same time in Germany with better notations
  um it's just often times these are just ideas that are just ready but s Point um
  so Newton's theory of classical mechanics is false on a scientifically theoretical
  basis um if we wanted to actually calculate things like momentum we would have to
  take into account things like relativity Theory and eal MC s and whatnot um but
  we tend to move at speeds that are so much slower than the speed of light that it's
  it would be not only insane to require that level of precision but impossible to
  measure at that level of precision so we instead just use the the three regular
  laws so that's what is it um basically law one is inertia exists things that moving
  in a straight line tend to keep moving unless acted on object in motion tends to
  stay in motion L acted upon by force number two is really the our our best friend
  here f equals Ma Force equals mass acceleration if you have a mass that is accelerating
  that is called a force Mass is measured in kilog acceleration is measured in meters
  per second squared or really distance is measured in meters time is measured in
  seconds acceleration is meter over second squ and so kilog time me squ we call that
  Newton R uh and then three is for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction
  so push on something it pushes back um so I spent a lot of my earlier academic life
  thinking our thoughts about pendul pendulums pendul even brought a CH and tell book
  this book is called seven tales of the pendulum it's great it's about basically
  like seven cases of like ways that like pendula pendulums have been like very core
  to the way that we do science for a very long time um and there's all sorts of crazy
  stories in here about like using p like like using clocks to be able to Traverse
  the Atlantic Ocean like you had to invent the clock before you could Traverse an
  ocean um using changes in the period of a pendulum to figure out the density of
  the ground below you to find iron um FCO pendulums which are like the things in
  museums that knock the sticks down if they go in a circle but anyways um so let
  this is called a free body diagram and that's is a hanging pendulum let's call this
  L that's an L let's call that let's call that that um so that's basically this right
  so we have a a point of mass dangling below a point of rotation and we're going
  to pretend that this stick has no Mass um which we kind of approximate by this thing
  because the mass is so heavily towards this side and I'm going to make this about
  balance and posture in a second by basically taking this and putting it up like
  that but let's focus on the basics for now so so this is a this is the mass and
  then this is gravity gravity is 9.8 me/ second per second let's call it 10 um so
  gravity is pulling down which means that this string is pulling up because gravity
  is pulling down at 10 meters per second per second but this thing isn't moving right
  and we know that if if there's something if there's a force acting on a mass then
  it has to be moving so if it's if there's a force acting on the mass and it's not
  moving moving and there has to be an equal and opposite force acting it's statically
  stable great so now let's push it up here this is still L same length let's call
  thisa don't you have to worry about it gravity is still pulling down the same Force
  same mass that it has except now we know that it will pull this will now Accel so
  gravity pulling like this uh and then we do like some Vector decomposition thing
  right and then it's like the the string is still pulling on it but it's not aligned
  with the axis of gravity so there's this like leftover arrow and that arrow is pushing
  this way which means it's going to accelerate that way and then and it does like
  this um so details details but the important thing here is just to note that basically
  you have a mass here that's sort of you can lift it when it's at it sort of zero
  point so right now so we can look at so the Theta when it's here is zero like just
  say the angle of deflection from the vertical point is is zero great and then we
  move it over here we say angle is Theta which is just some arbitrary angular number
  could be 12 degrees could be one radian doesn't matter and when we put it over here
  uh it has and we let it go it will swing back and intuitively we kind of know we've
  probably seen like the demo where you pulled the thing you let it go comes back
  hit your face whatever unless it's the internet edited the video and do get hit
  my face um so as it goes over here it will pick up speed it'll pick up momentum
  and it'll get back to the same point that it was before except now it's going to
  instead of its velocity being its angle being zero its velocity being zero its angle
  will be zero but its velocity will be high because it's swinging and then that will
  sort of take it up over here until it bleeds off all that speed and then spiler
  alert that will be negative Theta if there's no friction or whatever in the system
  and then now we're over here and we're in the same place we were before and so we're
  going to go back and so we swing back and forth and so there's two main things to
  note here so this point here think about with mechanics you pretty much have potential
  and kinetic energy if you don't you're not thinking about things like stretch and
  strain so when I take the thing and I throw it up and I catch it when it leaves
  my hand it has kinetic energy going up but the sorry potential and kinetic energy
  whatever uh potential energy is mass time gravity time height Mass doesn't change
  gravity doesn't change let's just say potential energy is the same thing as height
  um kinetic energy is m s one half doesn't change Mass doesn't change who cares about
  the square let's just say kinetic energy is the same thing as speed so you have
  your height and you have your speed and that basically defines your mechanics um
  yeah so when you throw something into the air you start out with a lot of kinetic
  energy pointing up and as you go up to the next time step gravity is going to pull
  down it's going to sort of bleed off some of your vertical height and then eventually
  it's going to take all of your upward kinetic energy and then you'll have you sort
  of pay up here at this Apex Point maximum height zero uh velocity in the vertical
  and then it repeats that process and do this nice parabolic trajectory and if you
  want it to be nicely parabolic you have to care about the square but that's not
  important right now um yeah so so hanging pendulums are I'll just mention this just
  for the symmetry of it and it might come up later I guess it'll come up with the
  jump and stuff so when you when you have a pendulum that's a simple harmonic oscillator
  swinging back and forth there's sort of two to three points to really think about
  one is at the Apex here where it has the maximum height but zero um velocity one
  is down here where it has uh minimum height but maximum velocity and then the opposite
  on the other side and it's one of these things where like you can if you want to
  look into State spaces like you can get the height here and the velocity there and
  a nice pendulum will trace a nice ellipse look up the Wikipedia page on pendula
  and you'll see some really cool gifts of the state space diagrams of hanging pendulums
  the most important and most relevant thing for the standing posture case which is
  what we're here to talk about is that a thing to note about this is that this is
  passively stable where it is if I perturb it from its sort of happy zero point it
  will that the resulting acceleration will pull it back towards that happy stable
  point and because there's damping and like energy gets lost in the system it will
  sort of die down back to where it is so a so if this is time we're doing dynamical
  systems modeling because I put time on the axis so congratulations you now I know
  how to do that um and then this is Theta if I deflect this thing down to whatever
  Theta is it will pull itself back towards theta equals z it'll pass through it because
  of the momentum and will go back and forth if there's no friction or anything like
  that it'll just do that forever there is friction it will sort of come back to it's
  happy stable point now all of these same Dynamics work if you flip it upside down
  except it's no longer friendly and passively stable so this is where it becomes
  Neuroscience so now this is the floor so we were doing a regular pendulum we're
  now going to do inverted pendulum this is another highly googleable term it's inverted
  pendulum human movement get all sorts of stufffly during for Locomotion uh so now
  we have the same guy attached to a point on the floor um we still have L we still
  have M and oh I forgot to mention if you wanted to calculate like the forces like
  the Newtons and stuff like that because this is a meter we can you could calculate
  those things in units of I guess you wouldn't know kilograms either but you could
  get some weird wacky unit that was equivalent to that um so uh yeah so that's call
  it Center M and we'll call this base of support so remember with this type of thing
  I drew the vertical lines showing where going to show up showing where the extent
  of the base of support is um this guy that region of controllability is an infimal
  a non-existent thing because it's basically this deflection Point here is Thea equal
  Z and whereas before with a hanging pendulum if I perturb it from that point the
  resulting uh acceleration will pull it back towards that point and it will sort
  of cycle through there if if you're up here you're not quite so lucky um this is
  the place where if we so this is called the vertical projection of the thing which
  is basically this you know if this was X Y call this y let say yal Z and now this
  is X and that's vertical projection um and so just like before the thing that I
  deleted like at some point in my life um I started pulling erasing things on a board
  deleting them which is always fun um so uh kind of like before you have you have
  gravity pulling down on this thing here which means you have gravity pulling down
  here have structure of the stick pushing up and if it's balanced here happily then
  these things cancel each other out perfectly and nothing nothing bad happen now
  if there's a little bit of deflection from that point in the same way this thing
  gravity is still pulling down the stick is doing its best um but it's they're misaligned
  so there's a a resulting sorry yeah that's right so the there's some geometry stuff
  you can do here if you want somea whatever trigonometry um but basically the the
  amount that they are separated from each other means that the force of basically
  that the this one's not um the stick is doing its best to keep you up but now it
  is also pushing you away and the gravity that's pulling and also sort of leading
  to a push in the in in a direction away from that happy stable point so this so
  with a hanging pendulum a deflection leads to this nice result you know uh relaxing
  back to zero uh this is a even a a small deflection will push it away so is a passively
  unstable thing and if it's I guess I guess this is the ground so you hit the ground
  or if you have if you go around then it just goes back around the angle basically
  goes down to the bottom and it get it gets pulled to the other attractor point which
  is the bottom it's this is technically a stable point but any infantes shift will
  cause for accumulating error and it will get pushed away this is not there you go
  and if you do the state space diagram you have like basically regions of the space
  I'm not going to explain this but you can look for the pictures and ask a bot about
  it um this is uh it called I think this is beta this Isa Dot and for some of those
  uh some of the space there is periodic orbits the other is not periodic orbits Yeah
  in our particular case a nonperiodic orbit means that you fall over and hit the
  ground or you either have to like change your base of support or you have to hit
  the Flor right so uh so much like science standing is also impossible there a passively
  unstable system that cannot be reconciled which is a shame um actually no luckily
  we we do have nervous systems so this is passively stable congratulations it go
  there it goes and it's still an inverted pendulum it's just that the center of mass
  is so close to the ground that I have to perturb it pretty far for it to get out
  of that sort of happy Zone and then it does fall over to the GR in this case the
  Cent the center of the base of support is still a point of X has an extent um but
  if I let go it will slowly accelerate the acceleration this is one of those like
  it's a it's a compounding error so like it starts out the acceleration is small
  but then it get but then on the next time step it's a little bigger the next ma
  up it's a little bigger and so it slowly picks up speed until it falls over um and
  if that was the whole story then that would be the whole story um but luckily for
  us we have sort of nonzero base of support and a whole nervous system attached to
  a bunch of weird electrical Springs that we can use to for actively control it so
  this one is like I'm sure everyone done this with the broom if you haven't you should
  this I am basically monitoring the error in the in the deflection from zero and
  I'm using a combination of like the weight in my hand and also like looking at it
  and then I am actively moving the base of support to uh keep basically if it's accelerating
  in this direction I move the base of support So accelerates in that direction I'm
  trying to sort of make it zero I could make it kind of swing back and forth but
  it's a it's an active process that I'm doing that is allowing the thing to stay
  up even though it is passively unstabled and the best video I have about that is
  this one oh this is the wrong I don't have the overlay here but she's standing on
  this ball and this is basically like the wble board stuff um and I put a link to
  the part I'll fix it later but um basically because she's on her toe her base her
  her anatomical base of support is very small but she's on this ball that actually
  spreads out the center of pressure or it SS out the base of support allows her to
  move her Center of pressure um in order to like counteract the movement so it's
  when I seem to like like oh my God she's standing on that thing that's so impressive
  it is very impressive but it's actually easier than Standing On Solid Ground because
  it extends her ability to move the Bas of and if I had a overlay be like wow um
  so obviously that's a lot uh it will all be on the test there's no test and if there
  was it would um but do look up the the Wikipedia page about pendul it's surprisingly
  deep uh Wikipedia is the greatest intellectual achievement of humankind um up to
  the present moment and anyone that says otherwise is it's taken um but yeah so we're
  going to now look very briefly at like so if you recall the last time when I was
  here doing doing the the recordings um I we had the two recordings of me balancing
  on my feet yeah so on the one hand I was I was balancing so I was standing on two
  feet and I lean all the way forward and all the way back and all the way to the
  right all the way to the left and then sitting on one foot and so actually I'm gonna
  I'll play this and we'll probably be able to tell which one is so so you can see
  so the ball here is Center of mass calculated in the ways that we do that the sticks
  are the rigid body segments that we used to make approximations they you know the
  mass of each one has been calculated according to that table with the center based
  off the I forgot there's a point on that table that shows like where the mass is
  relative to the proximal and dist joint proximal is close to the center distal is
  far away from the center um and you can sort of see stuff happening there I'm going
  to I'll I'll go back to this at a later date um but I do to show some some so yeah
  so this is the blender stuff and uh Aaron was kind enough to pull into the raw data
  and get started showing basic like representations that are sort of better equipped
  to show the differences between those two conditions because you can eyeball this
  and it kind of you can maybe kind of see it but that's not really results and it's
  also the effects actually small to see with your eyes um and so I'm going to show
  you is not it doesn't actually show that distinction but it just shows a quick uh
  presentation of uh the kinds of ways we can start analyzing this data to start looking
  at those distinctions um and then people who want to know more about this can split
  off and learn about that and then other people we could start talking about like
  the neural systems neural anatomical systems that go into that type of balance and
  support stuff um so long story short uh basically you just if you're not a code
  person just let it wash over you remember before I showed you that big old spreadsheet
  of numbers yeah so you first thing you do is you install packages that you need
  numpy is for numerical processing in Python um pandas is for processing with big
  spreadsheets plotly making plots so this is one of those like many many people have
  worked on these things for many many years nump in particular is has a has a sort
  of place in the history of numerical Computing in that that humans can do um so
  he's a venerable venerable guy um Stills in and then you basically you point it
  to the place at your computer where the data lives you say hey load in that body
  trajectories CSV CSV stands for comma separated values so if you look into that
  text file it would just be a bunch of numbers with comma between them and then enter
  and then a bunch of com them and that's how spreadsheets live at their sort of most
  basic level kind of in the same way that like uh your Microsoft Word document is
  the same thing as a raw text document CSV is the raw version of what happens in
  like Excel um so you take that and Pull It in it looks something like this this
  this formatted Square that's what pandas does that package that handles these things
  um and then you pull out the center of mass trajectories print them out just to
  make sure that you're not going crazy um these are the names of the mark of the
  the points that we're tracking um and then blah blah blah it's important but you
  don't worry about it uh and then you can take basically each of those points and
  it has a trajectory over time so this is the EXP position of the nose on this axis
  in meters and then this axis shows time where in our case time is frame number we
  could convert this to things like seconds by multiplying the frame number by the
  frame rate but it the shape would be the same but the scale would be different kind
  of like if we calculated those Newtons uh with this assuming that this was a meter
  you would get a certain number until you realize I lied to you this is not a meter
  like 1.2 meters um just the point to make that like those distinctions are arbitrary
  uh until you want to that would be just fine for you until you tried to compare
  your notse to somebody else who actually used a ruler um but often times units are
  just like scalers they really affect the shape of the data so this is the the path
  that my nose took on the xaxis of whatever thing you're looking at pull it out uh
  same thing except this is now the XYZ um see me jumping over here and same thing
  for Center of mass jump jum so basically like things like the nose are like raw
  measured points things like the center of mass is calculated from all of those trajectories
  plus the in cometry tables and then you do this is just basically Shuffle Stu around
  so that you can make a visualization this is just basically showing for each point
  for every frame that we have what is the XYZ position of all relevant dots uh and
  then the purple dot here is the center of mass noticing so this is basically like
  what scientific data visualization often looks like um it's very raw and it's very
  like it's just not really set up for this type of stuff it's not even scaling properly
  here this could be cleaned up and we'll do that going forward but this is one of
  the huge advantages of using something like blenders like this is a visualization
  tool for professional visualizers and anator the exact same data it's just this
  is being presented in something designed for like aesthetic visual outputs and this
  is something designed to plot two dimensional data and they begrudgingly added a
  3D viewer um but it's also good just to sort of show that you're not crazy because
  you can plot it and it's like oh yeah that looks like a person great also notice
  the dots are not connected um because the connections between the dots is not it's
  not a measured part of the data set like we know that the shoulder connected to
  the Elbow but we measured the shoulder we measured the elbow so this is just a raw
  representation if you wanted to draw the stick figures you would need to have additional
  information saying how to connect the dots which we're not doing a this juncture
  um now you go through you pull out so we're looking for we're going to look for
  the ground projection right we're comparing Center of Mass to support uh so we don't
  care about so before we were talking about jumping we cared a lot about that Z height
  number um now we're looking at a ground projection we throw away that Z height number
  because in our world at this right hand rule XY z z is up in some cases Y is up
  so no one ever says X is up but in our world z is up so we throw that away we just
  take Center Mass X Center Mass Y and we take the the points that Define the basic
  support left heel right heel uh Left Foot Right foot index which is toe um this
  particular tractor has a very impoverished foot that just has a heel on a toe um
  but we pull those out and that's enough to make a rectangle on the ground uh pull
  out the yeah do some stuff visualization code Shuffle Shuffle and you get this which
  is a nice so this is an animation with we play in a second but um so if you're ever
  color coding parts of the body the right side is red always because starts with
  an R you'll see it you people will get that wrong all the time and I saying from
  a moral position they are wrong if you're color cing the body the right side is
  red the left side is any other color that isn't green because red canuse B color
  so right foot left foot center of mass basically the top down View and play as much
  as it can so this is the uh control case um so you can see me leaning back and forth
  and uh on your own time uh stand up and lean see what that feels like and specifically
  see that notice that you can notice when you're at the edge and notice that that
  the heels have far less to do than the toes and that you have a sense of that relationship
  between your B of Support Center Mass even though you may not fully realize that
  so now you can sort of see what's happening from the top down and you can see now
  I'm shifting over and even though this is a very impoverished view of very complex
  data you still have a pretty good sense of what's going on on and you can also tell
  that this is the one where I'm not holding the the weight um and because I think
  my computer can handle it actually and then you can also plot the whole thing and
  it sort of become this kind of shmear which if you're thinking about things like
  Dynamics this is not a great way to look at it because you now squished over time
  but if you're worried about like what space did I cover how large I PL to be able
  to view it this is a great way to show all the spaces that my foot has gotten to
  in this recording um and just to see if it works it doesn't it's not your fault
  um although I think it will are numers oh see this is why it's good to have an external
  LIC nervous system okay so this is a panda notebook which I I don't like in many
  ways but they they do the job um I like they're they're really good for like really
  simple stuff like this in educational context but they don't scale in complexity
  at all so it's like you people wind up getting especially like student like objects
  tend to get stuck in Panda's notebooks for a long time in their trajectory um but
  oh that's that's morning we calculated it in my dark mode St um okay looking good
  so far so this is the same so this is now the data where I'm holding 20% of my body
  mass in my can and I wasn't careful like I realized that actually the better way
  to represent this would be to like hold statically on one side and try to hold it
  out away from me um because I was shifting it around a lot so you might have to
  just kind of like gut check it um and would also be nice if this was playing alongside
  the bigger visualization which we can do Andre actually wrote some code to make
  that EAS doable and yeah so that's yeah so there so basically the fact so here I'm
  it's actually my Center m is still my right but um but when I shift over to my left
  here yeah so you can you know that my foot is moving and you can see the center
  mass is just shifted a little bit on the outside so this is one of those thing was
  like to actually show this data more like to to make that point that is this distinction
  um this is kind of like it's like oh yeah the effect is there it could be measured
  it could be done whatever the behavior was not well set up to produce sort of good
  data but we can go back and record new data we could also basically just like give
  yourself a longer time standing there we could take this representation and couple
  it to the bigger visualization so we can actually verify and like we make pause
  button work um and then pause it and be like oh yeah look I'm standing here stable
  and supported but my b base of my center of mass is outside of my base of support
  because this Center of mass is not the actual Center of mass because we're not accounting
  for the fact that my hand and now instead of being 1% of my body mass is now 21%
  of my body mass we would have to recalculate the center mass of that in mind and
  then theoretically then it would shift back and start looking like the regular again
  the control condition okay got that good great um so as per usual I've also gone
  longer than I intended to but that's okay good stuff um so we have another 20 minutes
  which I do think is enough time to sort of get started with some stuff um uh so
  just show of hands like who who likes code and data who is interested in code and
  data you don't have to you don't have to be good at it you don't have to ever done
  it before you don't have to expect that you will be successful at it but who is
  interested in at least seeing what it would look like like we can get you to the
  place where you can click the buttons and have the squiddle show up like who is
  interested in that versus who is less interested in that code people okay cool a
  and then non-code people great the the biggest problem would have been if everybody
  said I want to do code so this is great um code people I guess push back and then
  eron can you just just try to get them like as far as you can get towards this like
  mostly just like probably besttop code and then CL Theo this is now in this notebook
  is now um great uh other people um we're going to I want you to to um do the same
  kind of like uh group work thing again probably by next week I will be able to have
  some sort of more feedback loopy thing with the pot but right now we're still passively
  just pour into it and basically ask it the questions that came up for you when you
  were watching me talk about all this stuff um if you're if you are interested in
  the mechanics of it you can ask more about the Robotics and control theory and anal
  systems and P stuff if you're more of a I don't know biologist uh you just just
  think about the types of neural systems that would have to be in place for this
  to be able to work like that like you do not have a center of mass detector that's
  not a thing that exists in your nervous system you have a bunch of other modalities
  that give you other types of information and that has the sort of effect effective
  reality that we could it's like functional equivalencies for those uh functionalism
  I always had a professor say philosophy of mind is so hard that makes functionalism
  look interesting which I will not explain I will just say you can chew on that if
  you want um yeah so let's let's get started we have like 15 minutes so um the and
  so do these chats in the the channel for this lecture um and just pop some open
  and then it's again whatever you found interesting whatever you wanted to have more
  about whatever sort of thing I said uh and don't work alone working clumps Clump
  up according to your local environment and Aon you could go back started coding
  so code people go to the back and Aon will go meet you and if you're not a code
  person and you're in the back uh you might want to move forward do it do it this
  may be your only chance whated what's that what if interested if you're interested
  in both do code so go code for now and you'll come back to this yeah if if you're
  interested in doing both this is not a either or you will be able to drop this opinion
  at your earliest convenience and there is a benefit if you have a a clump that is
  that has sort of that is congealing in some reliable way there's a benefit to having
  at least one person from your clump getting some code XP but you're not going to
  be evaluating on your anything okay I'm going to stop this repor so

  description: The lecture covers the concepts of balance, center of mass, and basis
    of support, with a focus on how these principles apply to both static and dynamic
    systems. The instructor uses practical demonstrations with props to illustrate
    how the center of mass changes with mass distribution and its importance in maintaining
    balance. The session also includes a discussion on reductionism versus holism
    in scientific approaches, and an overview of Newton's laws of motion as they relate
    to balance and movement. Students are introduced to data analysis and visualization
    techniques using Python, and the class splits into groups for practical work,
    with some focusing on coding and others on theoretical discussions.\n\n{\n    \

  text: okay great hello so welcome to October um if you already had one of those
    but welcome to October 8th uh so yeah so the So today we're going to talk about
    balance in center of mass and Bas of support and talk about that kind of thing
    and then after about an hour of talking about that kind of stuff we're gonna do
    some group stuff again but there's going to be um sort of like our first kind
    of technical split option um so if you are a person who is interested in code
    and programming and that type of thing um you'll have the opportunity to kind
    of split off and work on that kind of thing if you're not interested in that you
    can hang out and we'll do more like lit review types of stuff um if you've never
    done it but are curious then you're interested in it interested is not experi
    that's a separate thing um so uh the first thing I want to sort of show before
    we get into the meet is like this some this thing that's going to be kind of like
    a a rolling kind of checkpoint throughout the semester which is the AI weird aspect
    of this class where I have now the first instance of an example of scraping the
    server so basically pulling all of the chats that you've been having with the
    bot um effectively that like markdown text file that gets attached to the top
    of each chat I pull that out run it through the AI say summarize this pull out
    the main points and Main topics and then basically do that for like each chat
    and each Channel and each category and then the whole server and the idea is to
    sort of use that to try to get a sense of um like what you guys are working on
    what you're interested in and for now it's kind of like it's just descriptive
    so it's just like y'all are doing what you do and then this is sort of pull and
    you can look at it if you want um but one of the things we're going to do in that
    second half of class is sort of starting to steer this a little bit so say what
    are some things that seem to be coming up for a lot of people and like can we
    sort of get more details about those topics um can I look at that and say oh they're
    really interested in this thing when we talk about that next lecture that kind
    of sort of more of a feedback type of thing so um it's so the thing is a ZIP file
    so if you download it it will go to your uh downloads folder whatever that may
    be for you

  text: so you can unzip that so that it's just a regular fer your oh come on now
    is it giving you all that invalid thing um so it's here uh so in the server in
    the resources Channel at the top there's a thread called server scrape checkpoints
    and there's a zip file and I am totally happy saying that this checkpoint is the
    zip file is corrupted and we'll figure that out later cool so if you can figure
    it out great if not um it's a bunch of basically like poorly formatted summaries
    of the things You' been talking about and we just call this uh foreshadowing um
    there's a couple other things in that resources Channel too that I added uh one
    is this link up here to a YouTube playlist of these videos um except for last
    one's video because I forgot to save it um I forgot to hit save at the end of
    this and I wasn't saving to a video format that is forgiving of closing the thing
    mid recording so that video was lost rip lost data it happens um and then so yeah
    and then yeah that's another one of those like maybe we'll get to the thing where
    I can scrape the video and pull the transcript and get the topics out put that
    into the but we'll see about that um there's also this link to another playlist
    called AI stuff where I talk about things like building Skelly bot and like using
    it in classroom settings like this so if you're interested in that kind of like
    meta AI edte stuff watch that um yeah and then the third thing I added to the
    server is in this lectures category over here um this one down here which the
    string of numbers is the date so 2024 108 just a way to write your date concisely
    that's called little endian meaning the little things are the end of the number
    so de earth big big Indian little Indian that's what that means if you ever come
    across that again uh compsite people might no one else will um in that I put a
    link to an outline of what I'm going to talk about today which is some tur notes
    work these links don't work um but maybe you can figure it out they're over here
    okay um cool well so far don't really give you any option Cho um um yeah so obsidian
    calls folders

  text: vaults okay uh and so you want to be opening that folder as a vault okay uh
    if you feel like playing with that stuff go to any chat and just download the
    mbb stands for markdown it's the thing that turns this looking text into this
    looking text so you just type it out in the raw and then if it's MD and thing
    that you're looking at knows how to process markdown files it turns it into that
    um so download any the chat at the top um or download this that markdown I feel
    is the sort of the seed of the resol Revolution because it is we have just generally
    internalized this idea that like text is like Microsoft or Google when it really
    really isn't like text is like a behavior that you do on a keyboard and we want
    it to look nice but this is the raw that we actually care about is this and so
    it's also the first sort of entry point to like hey there's such a thing as interpreted
    text you type this thing the computer knows how to make it pretty um and uh yeah
    also uh Google Aaron Schwarz if you don't know who that is he's one of the people
    who sort of came up with the original definitions for markdown and uh you should
    look up who he is and then steal every paper ever published a lot of profess be
    like be careful don't go to HUB or you'll accidentally steal papers I'm telling
    you explicitly go to scub steal papers steal textbook from libgen as a scientist
    as operating under my academic freedom it is the best thing I can do for you to
    say every publishing industry steal all their data steal all their it's yeah they
    think it's their intellectual property it's not it's ours to steal it from them
    okay so none of that is relevant though um so we've been talking a lot about Center
    of mass I've sort of described it at various levels uh and today I've brought
    a series of props to help present that a eron could you screw that together thank
    you um so part of I think also part of the pattern that's emerging is I show up
    late I set up takes a while I'm frustrated and sweaty uh I eventually get it working
    I give like a little update on like the technical backend and AI nonsense I have
    some sort of like moral outrage moment and then I talk a little bit about like
    philosophy of science and then we get into the actual topic of discussion um so
    this is the philosophy of science part um so I've talked about the the concept
    of reductionism uh which is one of those things where it's like it's such a fundamental
    aspect of the way that we live in this sort of society in the way

  text: that we B basically the way that we do science in the western tradition is
    a heavily reductionist tradiction meaning that you take a a big complicated thing
    and you chop it up into tiny tiny tiny little pieces um and then you look at those
    pieces in isolated environments and then you you sort of hope that the things
    that you learn about those small scale isolated things will scale up to the larger
    actual desideratum of your study um and generally speaking it does right that's
    why we do cell biology that's why we learn about genetics that's why we learn
    about particle physics and you know periodic tables and stuff like that those
    are all fundamentally reductionist approaches to science um reductionist kind
    of sounds like an insult but it's not it's just a description of of a way of looking
    at things um the the counter to that doesn't really have so defined of a name
    but I generally sort of think of it as like more of a holism where instead of
    taking the thing that's sort of because the problem that reductionism solves is
    that science is impossible right rule number one can't be done we mere primates
    do not have access to capital T true facts of the world we can only approximate
    it with a bunch of sloppy empirical measurements and then statistics um the problem
    of induction in black swans if want to dig into that ho um and so because we can't
    actually do the thing we want to do which is like have true knowledge of the real
    world we have to cheat and take various sort of side steps and whatnot so the
    traditional Western productionist view of science is chop it up into little pieces
    and hope that those pieces sort of fit together into something that resembles
    the whole um a more holistic approach cheats in a different way where instead
    of taking the whole thing and chopping it up into little more parts and thinking
    about all those parts in isolation you take the whole complicated thing and you
    kind of just like squish it down into what you think or hope is like the minimum
    possible like the most the simplest possible model of that thing that captures
    the Dynamics of the whole thing so things like Center of mass which talked about
    we'll show some pictures in a second um is fundamentally that approach um and
    I've mentioned before this is like not NE this is not something you're likely
    to find in like specific textbooks this is more like things I've cobbled together
    in my research it's sort of inspired a lot by robotics approaches going to look
    up passive Dynamic Walkers is a classic one um art quo uh Andy ruen Steve Collins
    all those good folks um looked at how sort of taking the whole complicated object
    and then reducing it down to a single point Mass um can be very helpful to trying
    to understand

  text: what's going on there um I think I forgot to yeah so uh I brought a stick
    so this stick uh this is like the the the middle part of like a floor lamp and
    I found that on the street I tried use it it wasn't didn't really work right um
    and then I realized that the the middle part not only comes apart so I can put
    it in my backpack and bring it to class I used to have like a br stick that I
    cut at a meter and brought into the class but this thing pulls up also very nicely
    this turns out to be actually one meter long so I think somewhere at some Factory
    someone ordered a bunch of like meter long poles and cut them up and then now
    this is a meter stick um so it is uh aluminum or actually I metal and roughly
    straight it has some extent but we can ignore that and it also is in even section
    so this part here is the geometric center of the stick and if I put this little
    thing here then I can know that that is this is both the geometric center of the
    stick is's also the center of mass of the stick so if I take this object I focus
    on this um so basically if I take this stick and I chop it up into like 1 cm sections
    so there would be 100 in a row and I took the average position of each of those
    points um literally just take the XYZ of this one XYZ of that one XYZ of that
    one add up all the X's add up all the Y's divide them by the number of chunks
    the resulting average Position will be here and it turns out that from a point
    of view of like balance physics that is the point that you need to support in
    order to keep the thing from falling down whoa right um so that is true when you're
    supporting it from the bottom it is also true so this is called Loop pull the
    loop through itself that's called a dirt pitch uh if you pull it through again
    this is called a pric and it tends to and it stays worth this I have trusted my
    life and the Liv of many people I love to uh Nots in various contexts so a press
    I can nicely put over that little yellow spot crank it down so it'll stay and

  text: it from below the center of mass keeps it sort of where it needs to be um
    from the above it's the same basic idea so there's more mass on this side than
    there is on that side so I move it over a little bit and hooray bounce right so
    in this case because this is a uniformly massed object this the geometric center
    of it and the center of mass are the same place yes I also found these on the
    street there's a lot of fun things on the street if you know where to look these
    are like like old school like ankle weights I think like you know put them on
    your ankle I don't know um and this is like carpet pad so it's high friction and
    if I like that okay so I've changed both the geometry and the mass distribution
    um from the point of view so the geometry in the sort of the long axis of this
    thing hasn't actually changed much at all right it's the same length um around
    the in this particular case so for any 3D object you have a long axis you have
    a middle axis sometimes called intermediate axis you have a short axis which is
    the short one sometimes they are symmetric in this case the midle and medium medium
    are symmetric so get that um you can also Google the intermediate axis theorem
    otherwise known as the tennis racket theorem which says that you can spin it around
    the short axis you can spin it around the long axis spin around the middle axis
    it flips midair not relevant but fine there's some cool gifts of people doing
    stuff on the space station but that's not important right now so unsurprising
    I've changed basically I've changed the geometry a little bit not in an important
    not in a relevant Dimension um but I've changed the physics a lot so now this
    side is much heavier than that side uh because so before we were just taking the
    geometric mean you just take the positions of each of those points take the average
    and it happens to line up with a center of mass in this case uh that's not that
    doesn't work because all of those points that I'm adding up are not do not have
    the same density this is full of sand or something I don't really know so I can
    put the thing over here that's about right and there we go so now this is the
    center of mass so the geometry for our basic approximations hasn't changed um
    but the physics has changed quite a bit and so the center of mass has changed
    and so that balance point has changed

    it from the top right basic idea um if I wanted to do another one think there's
    two of them you can here we go once again even heavier so I can move it basically
    all the way over here and it's not quite right but now yeah so now it's the center
    of mass of the whole stick system is very close to the the Big Bob at the end
    notice that the first time I moved it I had to move it all the way over here the
    second time I had to move it far less that's because of like torque is a thing
    this is really hard this is really easy when we talk about the muscular skeletal
    system this will come up again if you're curious about how uh notice that my arm
    also resembles a long stick and my shoulder which is the main thing leaving it
    up is this long and attached right here so so it's much more like doing this than
    doing this so spiler alert your muscle muscles are like unbelievably strong relative
    to the task that they can perform because they're operating on a massive mechanical
    disadvantage that's not important right now so yeah okay so this is intuitive
    Center of mass uh there is a difference between the geometric center of a rigid
    object and the center of mass and Center of mass also you'll hear it be called
    center of gravity those are the same thing this is gravity being used in the term
    like density uh center of gravity just feels a little more old school to me or
    in space like in all contexts that matter for us Center of Mass center of gravity
    are the same thing so if you ever see cogg in a paper it's the same thing it's
    just you know using a different term um yeah Center of it's like yeah basically
    Center of density would be another way to say that but that's not quite okay so
    this is a stick made of trash I found on the street um excuse me this is a little
    wooden fellow and it also has a center of mass which I could measure if I wanted
    to I'm allowed to chop this up but I don't want to um but it is here if our friend

    mass is not a part of your body it is a description of your body and if you do
    one of these types of shape the center of mass can be outside of your body so
    the center Mass is like here because it's below that point of rotation it becomes
    passively stable and I can kind of perturbation rejecting which we'll talk about
    shortly so this would be a link but it's not I put over here so so this Center
    of mass approximation is like I think a very important and very useful uh hyper
    simplification of the full complex object um it falls under the general heading
    of like classical mechanics uh which is a part of mechanical engineering if you're
    kind of find the right building to walk into um and it specifically falls under
    I think it's called the finite element theorem which basically says that the that
    you're allowed to look at the center of mass as a as a proxy for the Dynamics
    of the whole thing so taking this complicated object chopping it up into like
    finite elements and then finite small but not zero um and then looking at the
    mean of those points tells you about the the full um tells you things about the
    Dynamics of the full complex object um and I think that's honestly I find that
    like keys I find helpful to think about that because this is also complex it's
    like gangly um but if you sort of throw it if no matter what you do it still follows
    a nicely ballistic trajectory and you can also use this to show that even if it's
    spinning it will spin around its Center of mass and follow a ballistic trajectory
    so you know each of these Keys is a rigid body they're connected by rigid bodies
    so there's no uh stretch or strain or anything like that in the Ballistic case
    it wouldn't matter but it's do that with people p um so uh in this case I don't

    much these ankle weights weigh but with if we wanted to we could figure out the

    um if you want to do that for like a human person uh it's so basically I want
    to be able to calculate the center of mass of a person um but how do I get those
    numbers well it turns out uh someone chopped up a bunch of dead people and weighed
    them and we have these anthropometry uh a really common one is winter um uh which
    is from like a biomechanics book and I think these tables here were it shows where
    they came from um I think it was like Air Force data they chopped up kabers and
    looked at the relative densities and did a bunch of statistical analyses and you
    get numbers so this is the geometry of it and so these numbers here like be able
    to read it but .52 H where H is total height of the person so this is estimate
    of sort of relative proportions of different body segments in terms of the just
    in units of height um importantly all the dead people they chopped up were men
    all the dead people they chopped up were old men because they were dead um often
    there's a correlation between age and time um there are newer uh anthropometry
    tables that look at a broader demographic um different genders different sort
    of um body mass indices or whatever um but by and large a lot of those differences
    are small um and relative to the scales that I tend to look at in my research
    They Don't Really shift the numbers that much so just kind of use these because
    it's a standard and it's you know around um so these names here correspond roughly
    to these guys up here and they give you the name of the thing the definition in
    terms of anatomical axes so the foot is defined as the lateral malis to the head
    of the metatarsal 2 so malis is that on the outside metatarsal is your uh tole
    I don't know Al to is like it's like your index toe knuckle if that's the thing
    and then it gives you the segment weight as a proportion of total body weight
    so your hand is roughly 6% of your body mass if you have standard standard side
    hands um forearm upper arm uh your foot is about that 01 14% seems high but I

    showing last time with the blender thing and that little ball moving around those
    were calculated by using these numbers and we'll talk about that in a little bit
    but just wanted to show roughly where that stuff comes from um I also so some
    time ago different life uh I would I made a bunch of gifts and posted them on
    Reddit in fact before Reddit was it was still a sess pit but it was a different
    kind of cesspit um and basically I would just go and find videos of people doing
    interesting things and then just overlay them with basically Center of mass analyses
    so this is the hand forearm it's a planer view so meaning that it's basically
    a view from straight down one of the x y z axes so you basically get to ignore
    the 3D aspect of it and just focus on the 2D uh the vertical line show the extent
    of the base of support which is basically where his hand is and then the thing
    to notice is that the center of mass always stays within that boundary because
    it has to because if it didn't would fall over and there's a bunch of these um
    this one is wacky uh so uh so this one I was getting fancier so I was actually
    stabilizing the image and this guy's very good at this type of thing so again
    just always stays there Center basic SP shifts ra shifts his hands and see like
    he's doing see look how screwy this like yeah yeah he's a freak um archerd or
    using Dynamics to sort of Pop himself up but keeping it within this range the
    important thing to know that his hand can only push on the ground so if the center
    of mass ever left those boundaries he cannot pull it back he can only push it
    farther away uh and this one is a a violation of that rule so this is balance
    beam otherwise known as the hardest what what's it in sports she does this cool
    thing but oh no she falls but then she pulls it back in and so the the most important
    part of that video for me is this point right there where it does go out but she

    of theory of mechanics which is embodied by Newton's three laws of motion uh which
    are false and wrong theoretical uh models of reality um this is I think a great
    example of like how wrong theories are still useful um Newton had a theory of
    reality where there was such a thing as position and velocity um and wasn't until
    far later that some guy named Einstein came along and wrote some papers um I really
    don't like like ascribing these thoughts to specific people because really they're
    just the specific humans that wrote it first like people say Newton invented calculus
    but lith also invented calculus at the same time in Germany with better notations
    um it's just often times these are just ideas that are just ready but s Point
    um so Newton's theory of classical mechanics is false on a scientifically theoretical
    basis um if we wanted to actually calculate things like momentum we would have
    to take into account things like relativity Theory and eal MC s and whatnot um

    is inertia exists things that moving in a straight line tend to keep moving unless

    two is really the our our best friend here f equals Ma Force equals mass acceleration
    if you have a mass that is accelerating that is called a force Mass is measured
    in kilog acceleration is measured in meters per second squared or really distance
    is measured in meters time is measured in seconds acceleration is meter over second

    action there is an equal and opposite reaction so push on something it pushes
    back um so I spent a lot of my earlier academic life thinking our thoughts about
    pendul pendulums pendul even brought a CH and tell book this book is called seven
    tales of the pendulum it's great it's about basically like seven cases of like
    ways that like pendula pendulums have been like very core to the way that we do
    science for a very long time um and there's all sorts of crazy stories in here
    about like using p like like using clocks to be able to Traverse the Atlantic
    Ocean like you had to invent the clock before you could Traverse an ocean um using
    changes in the period of a pendulum to figure out the density of the ground below
    you to find iron um FCO pendulums which are like the things in museums that knock
    the sticks down if they go in a circle but anyways um so let this is called a
    free body diagram and that's is a hanging pendulum let's call this L that's an
    L let's call that let's call that that um so that's basically this right so we
    have a a point of mass dangling below a point of rotation and we're going to pretend
    that this stick has no Mass um which we kind of approximate by this thing because
    the mass is so heavily towards this side and I'm going to make this about balance
    and posture in a second by basically taking this and putting it up like that but

    is pulling down which means that this string is pulling up because gravity is
    pulling down at 10 meters per second per second but this thing isn't moving right
    and we know that if if there's something if there's a force acting on a mass then
    it has to be moving so if it's if there's a force acting on the mass and it's
    not moving moving and there has to be an equal and opposite force acting it's
    statically stable great so now let's push it up here this is still L same length
    let's call thisa don't you have to worry about it gravity is still pulling down
    the same Force same mass that it has except now we know that it will pull this
    will now Accel so gravity pulling like this uh and then we do like some Vector
    decomposition thing right and then it's like the the string is still pulling on
    it but it's not aligned with the axis of gravity so there's this like leftover
    arrow and that arrow is pushing this way which means it's going to accelerate
    that way and then and it does like this um so details details but the important
    thing here is just to note that basically you have a mass here that's sort of
    you can lift it when it's at it sort of zero point so right now so we can look
    at so the Theta when it's here is zero like just say the angle of deflection from
    the vertical point is is zero great and then we move it over here we say angle
    is Theta which is just some arbitrary angular number could be 12 degrees could
    be one radian doesn't matter and when we put it over here uh it has and we let
    it go it will swing back and intuitively we kind of know we've probably seen like
    the demo where you pulled the thing you let it go comes back hit your face whatever
    unless it's the internet edited the video and do get hit my face um so as it goes
    over here it will pick up speed it'll pick up momentum and it'll get back to the
    same point that it was before except now it's going to instead of its velocity
    being its angle being zero its velocity being zero its angle will be zero but
    its velocity will be high because it's swinging and then that will sort of take
    it up over here until it bleeds off all that speed and then spiler alert that
    will be negative Theta if there's no friction or whatever in the system and then
    now we're over here and we're in the same place we were before and so we're going
    to go back and so we

  text: swing back and forth and so there's two main things to note here so this point
    here think about with mechanics you pretty much have potential and kinetic energy
    if you don't you're not thinking about things like stretch and strain so when
    I take the thing and I throw it up and I catch it when it leaves my hand it has
    kinetic energy going up but the sorry potential and kinetic energy whatever uh
    potential energy is mass time gravity time height Mass doesn't change gravity
    doesn't change let's just say potential energy is the same thing as height um
    kinetic energy is m s one half doesn't change Mass doesn't change who cares about
    the square let's just say kinetic energy is the same thing as speed so you have
    your height and you have your speed and that basically defines your mechanics
    um yeah so when you throw something into the air you start out with a lot of kinetic
    energy pointing up and as you go up to the next time step gravity is going to
    pull down it's going to sort of bleed off some of your vertical height and then
    eventually it's going to take all of your upward kinetic energy and then you'll
    have you sort of pay up here at this Apex Point maximum height zero uh velocity
    in the vertical and then it repeats that process and do this nice parabolic trajectory
    and if you want it to be nicely parabolic you have to care about the square but
    that's not important right now um yeah so so hanging pendulums are I'll just mention
    this just for the symmetry of it and it might come up later I guess it'll come
    up with the jump and stuff so when you when you have a pendulum that's a simple
    harmonic oscillator swinging back and forth there's sort of two to three points
    to really think about one is at the Apex here where it has the maximum height
    but zero um velocity one is down here where it has uh minimum height but maximum
    velocity and then the opposite on the other side and it's one of these things
    where like you can if you want to look into State spaces like you can get the
    height here and the velocity there and a nice pendulum will trace a nice ellipse
    look up the Wikipedia page on pendula and you'll see some really cool gifts of
    the state space diagrams of hanging pendulums the most important and most relevant
    thing for the standing posture case which is

  text: what we're here to talk about is that a thing to note about this is that this
    is passively stable where it is if I perturb it from its sort of happy zero point
    it will that the resulting acceleration will pull it back towards that happy stable
    point and because there's damping and like energy gets lost in the system it will
    sort of die down back to where it is so a so if this is time we're doing dynamical
    systems modeling because I put time on the axis so congratulations you now I know
    how to do that um and then this is Theta if I deflect this thing down to whatever
    Theta is it will pull itself back towards theta equals z it'll pass through it
    because of the momentum and will go back and forth if there's no friction or anything
    like that it'll just do that forever there is friction it will sort of come back
    to it's happy stable point now all of these same Dynamics work if you flip it
    upside down except it's no longer friendly and passively stable so this is where
    it becomes Neuroscience so now this is the floor so we were doing a regular pendulum
    we're now going to do inverted pendulum this is another highly googleable term
    it's inverted pendulum human movement get all sorts of stufffly during for Locomotion
    uh so now we have the same guy attached to a point on the floor um we still have
    L we still have M and oh I forgot to mention if you wanted to calculate like the
    forces like the Newtons and stuff like that because this is a meter we can you
    could calculate those things in units of I guess you wouldn't know kilograms either
    but you could get some weird wacky unit that was equivalent to that um so uh yeah
    so that's call it Center M and we'll call this base of support so remember with
    this type of thing I drew the vertical lines showing where going to show up showing
    where the extent of the base of support is um this guy that region of controllability

    here is Thea equal Z and whereas before with a hanging pendulum if I perturb it
    from that point the resulting uh acceleration will pull it back towards that point
    and it will sort of cycle through there if if you're up here you're not quite
    so lucky um this is the place where if we so this is called the vertical projection
    of the thing which is basically this you know if this was X Y call this y let
    say yal Z and now this is X and that's vertical projection um and so just like
    before the thing that I deleted like at some point in my life um I started pulling
    erasing things on a board deleting them which is always fun um so uh kind of like
    before you have you have gravity pulling down on this thing here which means you
    have gravity pulling down here have structure of the stick pushing up and if it's
    balanced here happily then these things cancel each other out perfectly and nothing
    nothing bad happen now if there's a little bit of deflection from that point in
    the same way this thing gravity is still pulling down the stick is doing its best
    um but it's they're misaligned so there's a a resulting sorry yeah that's right
    so the there's some geometry stuff you can do here if you want somea whatever
    trigonometry um but basically the the amount that they are separated from each
    other means that the force of basically that the this one's not um the stick is
    doing its best to keep you up but now it is also pushing you away and the gravity
    that's pulling and also sort of leading to a push in the in in a direction away
    from that happy stable point so this so with a hanging pendulum a deflection leads
    to this nice result you know uh relaxing back to zero uh this is a even a a small
    deflection will push it

    a nonperiodic orbit means that you fall over and hit the ground or you either
    have to like change your base of support or you have to hit the Flor right so
    uh so much like science standing is also impossible there a passively unstable
    system that cannot be reconciled which is a shame um actually no luckily we we
    do have nervous systems so this is passively stable congratulations it go there
    it goes and it's still an inverted pendulum it's just that the center of mass
    is so close to the ground that I have to perturb it pretty far for it to get out
    of that sort of happy Zone and then it does fall over to the GR in this case the
    Cent the center of the base of support is still a point of X has an extent um
    but if I let go it will slowly accelerate the acceleration this is one of those
    like it's a it's a compounding error so like it starts out the acceleration is
    small but then it get but then on the next time step it's a little bigger the
    next ma up it's a little bigger and so it slowly picks up speed until it falls
    over um and if that was the whole story then that would be the whole story um
    but luckily for us we have sort of nonzero base of support and a whole nervous
    system attached to a bunch of weird electrical Springs that we can use to for
    actively control it so this one is like I'm sure everyone done this with the broom
    if you haven't you should this

  text: I am basically monitoring the error in the in the deflection from zero and
    I'm using a combination of like the weight in my hand and also like looking at
    it and then I am actively moving the base of support to uh keep basically if it's
    accelerating in this direction I move the base of support So accelerates in that
    direction I'm trying to sort of make it zero I could make it kind of swing back
    and forth but it's a it's an active process that I'm doing that is allowing the
    thing to stay up even though it is passively unstabled and the best video I have
    about that is this one oh this is the wrong I don't have the overlay here but
    she's standing on this ball and this is basically like the wble board stuff um
    and I put a link to the part I'll fix it later but um basically because she's
    on her toe her base her her anatomical base of support is very small but she's
    on this ball that actually spreads out the center of pressure or it SS out the
    base of support allows her to move her Center of pressure um in order to like
    counteract the movement so it's when I seem to like like oh my God she's standing
    on that thing that's so impressive it is very impressive but it's actually easier
    than Standing On Solid Ground because it extends her ability to move the Bas of
    and if I had a overlay be like wow um so obviously that's a lot uh it will all
    be on the test there's no test and if there was it would um but do look up the
    the Wikipedia page about pendul it's surprisingly deep uh Wikipedia is the greatest
    intellectual achievement of humankind um up to the present moment and anyone that
    says otherwise is it's taken um but yeah so we're going to now look very briefly
    at like so if you recall the last time when I was here doing doing the the recordings
    um I

  text: we had the two recordings of me balancing on my feet yeah so on the one hand
    I was I was balancing so I was standing on two feet and I lean all the way forward
    and all the way back and all the way to the right all the way to the left and
    then sitting on one foot and so actually I'm gonna I'll play this and we'll probably
    be able to tell which one is so so you can see so the ball here is Center of mass
    calculated in the ways that we do that the sticks are the rigid body segments
    that we used to make approximations they you know the mass of each one has been
    calculated according to that table with the center based off the I forgot there's
    a point on that table that shows like where the mass is relative to the proximal
    and dist joint proximal is close to the center distal is far away from the center
    um and you can sort of see stuff happening there I'm going to I'll I'll go back
    to this at a later date um but I do to show some some so yeah so this is the blender
    stuff and uh Aaron was kind enough to pull into the raw data and get started showing
    basic like representations that are sort of better equipped to show the differences
    between those two conditions because you can eyeball this and it kind of you can
    maybe kind of see it but that's not really results and it's also the effects actually
    small to see with your eyes um and so I'm going to show

  text: you is not it doesn't actually show that distinction but it just shows a quick
    uh presentation of uh the kinds of ways we can start analyzing this data to start
    looking at those distinctions um and then people who want to know more about this
    can split off and learn about that and then other people we could start talking
    about like the neural systems neural anatomical systems that go into that type
    of balance and support stuff um so long story short uh basically you just if you're
    not a code person just let it wash over you remember before I showed you that
    big old spreadsheet of numbers yeah so you first thing you do is you install packages
    that you need numpy is for numerical processing in Python um pandas is for processing
    with big spreadsheets plotly making plots so this is one of those like many many
    people have worked on these things for many many years nump in particular is has
    a has a sort of place in the history of numerical Computing in that that humans
    can do um so he's a venerable venerable guy um Stills in and then you basically
    you point it to the place at your computer where the data lives you say hey load
    in that body trajectories CSV CSV stands for comma separated values so if you
    look into that text file it would just be a bunch of numbers with comma between
    them and then enter and then a bunch of com them and that's how spreadsheets live
    at their sort of most basic level kind of in the same way that like uh your Microsoft
    Word document is the same thing as a raw text document CSV is the raw version
    of what happens in like Excel um so you take that and Pull It in it looks something
    like this this this formatted Square that's what pandas does that package that
    handles these things um and then you pull out the center of mass trajectories
    print them out just to make sure that you're not going crazy um these are the
    names of the mark of the the points that we're tracking um and then blah blah
    blah it's important but you don't worry about it uh and then you can take basically
    each of those points and it has a trajectory over time so this is the EXP position
    of the nose on this axis in meters and then this axis shows time where in our
    case time is frame number we could convert this to things like seconds by multiplying
    the frame number by the frame rate but it the shape would be the same but the
    scale would be different kind of like if

  text: we calculated those Newtons uh with this assuming that this was a meter you
    would get a certain number until you realize I lied to you this is not a meter
    like 1.2 meters um just the point to make that like those distinctions are arbitrary
    uh until you want to that would be just fine for you until you tried to compare
    your notse to somebody else who actually used a ruler um but often times units
    are just like scalers they really affect the shape of the data so this is the
    the path that my nose took on the xaxis of whatever thing you're looking at pull
    it out uh same thing except this is now the XYZ um see me jumping over here and
    same thing for Center of mass jump jum so basically like things like the nose
    are like raw measured points things like the center of mass is calculated from
    all of those trajectories plus the in cometry tables and then you do this is just
    basically Shuffle Stu around so that you can make a visualization this is just
    basically showing for each point for every frame that we have what is the XYZ
    position of all relevant dots uh and then the purple dot here is the center of
    mass noticing so this is basically like what scientific data visualization often
    looks like um it's very raw and it's very like it's just not really set up for
    this type of stuff it's not even scaling properly here this could be cleaned up
    and we'll do that going forward but this is one of the huge advantages of using
    something like blenders like this is a visualization tool for professional visualizers
    and anator the exact same data it's just this is being presented in something
    designed for like aesthetic visual outputs and this is something designed to plot
    two dimensional data and they begrudgingly added a 3D viewer um but it's also
    good just to sort of show that you're not crazy because you can plot it and it's
    like oh yeah that looks like a person great also notice the dots are not connected
    um because the connections between the dots is not it's not a measured part of
    the data set like we know that the shoulder connected to the Elbow but we measured
    the shoulder we measured the elbow so this is just a raw representation if you
    wanted to draw the stick figures you would need to have additional information
    saying how to connect the dots which we're not doing a this juncture um now you
    go through you pull out so we're looking for we're going to look for the ground
    projection right we're comparing Center of Mass to support uh so we don't care
    about so before we were talking about jumping we cared a lot about that Z height
    number um now we're looking at a ground

  start: 3780.0
  text: projection we throw away that Z height number because in our world at this
    right hand rule XY z z is up in some cases Y is up so no one ever says X is up
    but in our world z is up so we throw that away we just take Center Mass X Center
    Mass Y and we take the the points that Define the basic support left heel right
    heel uh Left Foot Right foot index which is toe um this particular tractor has
    a very impoverished foot that just has a heel on a toe um but we pull those out
    and that's enough to make a rectangle on the ground uh pull out the yeah do some
    stuff visualization code Shuffle Shuffle and you get this which is a nice so this
    is an animation with we play in a second but um so if you're ever color coding
    parts of the body the right side is red always because starts with an R you'll
    see it you people will get that wrong all the time and I saying from a moral position
    they are wrong if you're color cing the body the right side is red the left side
    is any other color that isn't green because red canuse B color so right foot left
    foot center of mass basically the top down View and play as much as it can so
    this is the uh control case um so you can see me leaning back and forth and uh
    on your own time uh stand up and lean see what that feels like and specifically
    see that notice that you can notice when you're at the edge and notice that that
    the heels have far less to do than the toes and that you have a sense of that
    relationship between your B of Support Center Mass even though you may not fully
    realize that so now you can sort of see what's happening from the top down and
    you can see now I'm shifting over and even though this is a very impoverished
    view of very complex data you still have a pretty good sense of what's going on
    on and you can also tell that this is the one where I'm not holding the the weight
    um and because I think my computer can handle it actually and then you can also
    plot the whole thing and it sort of become this kind of shmear which if you're
    thinking about things like Dynamics this is not a great way to look at it because
    you now squished over time but if you're worried about like what space did I cover
    how large I PL to be able to view it this is a great way to show all the spaces
    that my foot has gotten to in this

  text: recording um and just to see if it works it doesn't it's not your fault um
    although I think it will are numers oh see this is why it's good to have an external
    LIC nervous system okay so this is a panda notebook which I I don't like in many
    ways but they they do the job um I like they're they're really good for like really
    simple stuff like this in educational context but they don't scale in complexity
    at all so it's like you people wind up getting especially like student like objects
    tend to get stuck in Panda's notebooks for a long time in their trajectory um
    but oh that's that's morning we calculated it in my dark mode St um okay looking
    good so far so this is the same so this is now the data where I'm holding 20%
    of my body mass in my can and I wasn't careful like I realized that actually the
    better way to represent this would be to like hold statically on one side and
    try to hold it out away from me um because I was shifting it around a lot so you
    might have to just kind of like gut check it um and would also be nice if this
    was playing alongside the bigger visualization which we can do Andre actually
    wrote some code to make that EAS doable and yeah so that's yeah so

  text: there so basically the fact so here I'm it's actually my Center m is still
    my right but um but when I shift over to my left here yeah so you can you know
    that my foot is moving and you can see the center mass is just shifted a little
    bit on the outside so this is one of those thing was like to actually show this
    data more like to to make that point that is this distinction um this is kind
    of like it's like oh yeah the effect is there it could be measured it could be
    done whatever the behavior was not well set up to produce sort of good data but
    we can go back and record new data we could also basically just like give yourself
    a longer time standing there we could take this representation and couple it to
    the bigger visualization so we can actually verify and like we make pause button
    work um and then pause it and be like oh yeah look I'm standing here stable and
    supported but my b base of my center of mass is outside of my base of support
    because this Center of mass is not the actual Center of mass because we're not
    accounting for the fact that my hand and now instead of being 1% of my body mass
    is now 21% of my body mass we would have to recalculate the center mass of that
    in mind and then theoretically then it would shift back and start looking like
    the regular again the control condition okay got that good great um so as per
    usual I've also gone longer than I intended to but that's okay good stuff um so
    we have another 20 minutes which I do think is enough time to sort of get started
    with some stuff um uh so just show of hands like who who likes code and data who
    is interested in code and data you don't have to you don't have to be good at
    it you don't have to ever done it before you don't have to expect that you will
    be successful at it but who is interested in at least seeing what it would look
    like like we can get you to the place where you can click the buttons and have
    the squiddle show up like who is interested in that versus who is less interested
    in that code people okay cool a and then non-code people great the the biggest
    problem would have been if everybody said I want to do code so this is great um
    code people I guess push back and then eron can you just just try to get them

    CL Theo this is now in this notebook is now um great uh other people um we're
    going to I want you to to um do the same kind of like uh group work thing again
    probably by next week I will be able to have some sort of more feedback loopy
    thing with the pot but right now we're still passively just pour into it and basically
    ask it the questions that came up for you when you were watching me talk about
    all this stuff um if you're if you are interested in the mechanics of it you can
    ask more about the Robotics and control theory and anal systems and P stuff if
    you're more of a I don't know biologist uh you just just think about the types
    of neural systems that would have to be in place for this to be able to work like
    that like you do not have a center of mass detector that's not a thing that exists
    in your nervous system you have a bunch of other modalities that give you other
    types of information and that has the sort of effect effective reality that we
    could it's like functional equivalencies for those uh functionalism I always had
    a professor say philosophy of mind is so hard that makes functionalism look interesting
    which I will not explain I will just say you can chew on that if you want um yeah
    so let's let's get started we have like 15 minutes so um the and so do these chats
    in the the channel for this lecture um and just pop some open and then it's again
    whatever you found interesting whatever you wanted to have more about whatever
    sort of thing I said uh and don't work alone working clumps Clump up according
    to your local environment and Aon you could go back started coding so code people
    go to the back and Aon will go meet you and if you're not a code person and you're
    in the back uh you might want to move forward do it do it this may be your only
    chance whated what's that what if interested if you're interested in both do code
    so go code for now and you'll come back to this yeah if if you're interested in
    doing both this is not a either or you will be able to drop this opinion at
