full_transcript: and recording great hello everybody Welcome to whatever today may
  bring um yikes so uh let's see a lot of things a lot of sort of technical things
  that nobody asked for have been partially completed um so today the topic of the
  day will be eyeballs um specifically like the basic biology Neuroscience of how
  your eyeballs work and connect to your brain all that kind of stuff um and we're
  going to get to that but that's that's going to be another kind of like in the spirit
  of the motor hierarchy thing where I have less prepared because I was making these
  things um but this is a topic I know a lot about and so this is some some mainly
  going to be trying to give like a large scale overview of all of the relevant of
  as many of the relevant parts to Vision as we can get to um and then sort of see
  where that gets us uh and then next week we'll talk about Evolution and then we'll
  take stock from there because there's a couple other things I want to get done this
  semester um at this point in semester y'all are probably wondering about your grades
  don't worry about your grades just show up check boxes you're fine um the concept
  of grading is about ordering you relative to your performance relative to your peers
  and I just don't think that's a valuable form of Education um there's a really awful
  but very formative paper written in 1970 called higher education as a filter written
  by Kenneth filter Kenneth no Kenneth arrow with the premise being that what we're
  supposed to do in higher ed is give you guys a chance to outcompete your peers so
  that the purchasers of Labor know which one of you are the good ones who are worth
  the money and uh that in general and that's not what I like doing in my job um I
  do not care about how you perform relative to each other I don't even know what
  performance would mean in this context um so don't worry about it talk to the bot
  as long as you as long as you have like at least a thousand words written in this
  in the server which I'm pretty sure almost all of you already have um you're fine
  even that like just that's you'll be fine if if anyone is a problem I'll let you
  know and say hey just check some boxes so that I don't so I could stand up to audit
  I guess if I need to As Long As I don't record it and put it online anywhere um
  yeah so don't stress dear thing uh I'm sure you have plenty of other parts of your
  life that are adding stress so focus on those um education doesn't have to hurt
  learning doesn't have to be a painful process if you feel that here doing great
  okay where are we now so um I did a big refactor of the AI code uh refactor in the
  context of code and software basically means like redoing it like rewriting it like
  changing the structure up cleaning things out it was kind of a lot of like code
  that I wrote Under duress like at sort of like over the past several years in various
  classes so when there's a very important rule that you unfortunately are also not
  really prepared they're not it's not really a part of the undergraduate education
  to focus on things that last for longer than a semester um and you guys are really
  given this I think pretty awful approach to productivity which is like here's a
  shortterm hard deadline get it over the case throw it away start again from scratch
  and if you're going to be working on something you work on it a lot for a long time
  and then it'll get better and better and blah blah blah that's not really how the
  world tends to work typically things are much more iterative and you sort of work
  on the same thing over and over again um and when that happens you can kind of get
  to this point where you're kind of like blocked by your own work um in software
  they call it Tech debt like you have a bunch of like slop that you every little
  sloppy decision you made along the way kind of builds up um and so it's very important
  to like often just like take a step back and kind of like restart um it's again
  a very counterintuitive thing that it like like throwing all your work away and
  starting again from scratch is often a very productive way to live your life because
  often when you start a project it's more Discovery and then once you kind of know
  what the structure is recreating it with the end point and the starting point known
  can often lead to much cleaner work all that is to say um I rewrote the code and
  now it does some neat stuff um well it does the same things this one of the frustrating
  about refactoring code it actually has very similar functionality but now it's cleaner
  you can build off of it and one of the things I built off of it was uh looking per
  student um so and then some other stuff which I will show you shortly so let's take
  a quick um quick sort of pass through that do time okay yeah yeah I'm not going
  to get too into the Weeds on this although we want to uh so most recent server thing
  same as before just download it here um there might be a couple extra things in
  the zip file but don't stress about that and so grab that and if you open it now
  in obsidian uh open folder as a vault paste that go there uh probably actually this
  one yeah select that it's white always white I don't know why actually not always
  white always white on this computer when I open a new one while my other computer
  doesn't do that dark mode because light is effort um okay uh so it's quite similar
  um to before um the main difference is I also change the way that I do the like
  the call to open AI to do the AI analysis stuff um and the new way should be cleaner
  it should like have less slop um hard to tell numerically but just generally should
  be more robust and also now there's this server there's this little U what's it
  called folder called by user which is basically I I went through in every chat that
  your IDE appeared in is sort of smushed into there um I didn't really do any anything
  beyond that uh and so there's a bunch of files in there they're user idore and like
  your Discord user ID um uh because the other thing I did is by so with the way that
  this like weird world of AI text analysis Works um you can kind of do the the scale
  of the text is you can be pretty like goall about it like you just make kind of
  a machine to analyze the text you just throw different Blobs of text into it so
  up until this point the only analysis was done at the chat level so at the level
  of those threads you were sort of doing summaries and pulling out things that look
  like this um but part of the refactoring was making it more generic which is often
  what happens um and so now it's also set up that instead of dropping in a chat I
  can also drop in like every blob text in a particular category um so this is I'm
  actually not sure so this is basically like the summary of the text channels category
  which is not a very exciting one um but the so every folder with a category also
  has a thing says category index um and this is the summary of everything that happened
  in that category and then you can also go into individual channels and channel index
  so it's the same thing so it's kind of this there's this multiscale thing happening
  here which I think is kind of a very general idea in a lot of the natural world
  where you have this kind of like the term is like scale-free structure where you
  can do the same analysis on zoomed in version of the thing as well as the zoomed
  out version of the thing um so and then yeah and then that does sort of interesting
  thing to uh yeah so and then by user or know what this is going to look like yeah
  I don't I don't actually this person see it's like this it looks like this person
  only has one chat but I don't trust the code enough to trust that so if that is
  you and you have more we'll probably clean that up um but yeah so theoretically
  you should be in there so now if you look at the graph view we again get just the
  white dots of nothing until we add tags and now we get this kind of thing and we
  can do as well let's see so we can do groups new group and then we look for file
  colon uh user ID and then we can look for file uh channel channel index actually
  just do index and we're getting sort of this interesting kind of structure there's
  still not like a ton of navigability here um largely I think because of H obsidian
  works but basically actually I can do now a search so I so in the filters I do file
  colon user ID user is just kind of a generic term for anybody using a thing in this
  context user kind of means student um I'm also in there uh but yeah so now these
  so the blue dots here are the chats for a given one of you uh and I think if you
  just search for your user ID you'll find yourself um and I'll I'll make better ways
  to navigate this but with oh come on now dang it right so groups file user pink
  bright pink so theoretically here this is also a place that I wish that I had more
  control over like what is visible at which point and you know like I wish I could
  make the tags have less pole than the other ones but that's kind of limitation of
  uh obsidian but this is a you doing that oh text fate distance be brighter okay
  Center Force so this is now starting to get at like a map of y'all's actual proper
  interests so if I hover over one of these pink ones which are the students um this
  particular person has interest in so things like Neuroscience are obviously very
  highly connected because everyone has been talking about Neuroscience stuff um and
  just so again just to be clear this sort of summary of a given person is every single
  chat all the text of every chat that they have even been tangentially a part of
  so if you even just sent one message and one in like a 50 message Chat that's all
  in here um and then it runs through and says hey give me a give me a title give
  me an extremely short summary give me some highlights give me a very short summary
  blah blah blah blah blah um so these are the things so for you these are the things
  that just emerg from the statistics of what you were talking to the machine about
  um and like lose again damn it that is so annoying a file user user all right it's
  fine poies to any red green color bind people in the room um so for example good
  old user 12830 95453 45953 3792 uh has the main tags that came out of them which
  again like don't if if your favorite thing didn't come out if the thing if like
  if you don't think this is a good representation of you um just know that it's like
  the bot's kind of dumb like it it doesn't know like it can't tell if you're excited
  it can't tell like if it's if it if you said something and it said a bunch of stuff
  about something you don't care about it can't tell that cuz those words are in the
  data um so this will person so 53792 is the last digits has an interest has interest
  in Neuroscience epidemiology public health and hallucinations this is one of those
  where like that's the only epidemiology which I know isn't true because I know that
  y'all been talking about that but like pick this person over here um you know so
  they so they they're now so the motor hierarchy tag is connecting these two people
  um and you know so like all of these people have said enough about biomechanics
  that it showed up in their message uh or in their summary um this this one motor
  control so theoretically um not quite yet but this is kind of a it's a landscape
  of like an interest map so this is sort of it's different I think like these are
  not because if your guys are because there's in the the larger scale thing in all
  of this this is everything that was discussed at all like this was the total conversation
  and a lot of this could be cleaned up blah blah blah um here the the gray dots are
  just any chat um but once you start looking at the the statistics of the user based
  stuff we start to get the things that like hypothetically like if you are going
  around and every time you're in a chat you mention epidemiology it's going to show
  up here differently than would show up in the general statistics because we're now
  grouping by particular factors and that particular factor is roughly one per human
  um so that's cool uh so we can navigate that and um sort of uh I need to make a
  better like interface for navigating that but it is technically there uh the other
  thing that I did is related to this concept so this is this is the place where I'm
  not going to go down this rabbit hole although I will do it later in the semester
  um we've talked a bit about 3D space and sort of like objects exist in 3D space
  and you can have XYZ data and in spatial Dimensions so if you're thinking about
  data if you have up to three dimensions you can plot that spatially by just putting
  XYZ as you know length width height or whatever um and so if you have two data points
  in a three-dimensional space you can measure distances between them um which is
  you know ukian geometry not particularly exciting or it is exciting but it's probably
  not it's probably familiar um there's a there's a strange corollary to that in this
  world of AI natural language processing um that relates to the concept of an embedding
  um and basically in the same way that each one of those Blobs of text can be attached
  to uh can we keep run through that summarization scheme you can also get the the
  embedding of that blob of text within the very high dimensional space of the language
  that the language model has access to um I'm not going to be able to say this in
  any way that makes sense in the short in a briefly but basically instead of being
  like threedimensional things like each blob of text that an AI an open AI B llm
  processes is embedded in a 1532 dimensional space so 1,53 too and so a given blob
  of text gets put into that space and the that location in that super high dimensional
  space has something to do with its meaning and in that space you can also do things
  like measure distances and see like things that are close together are similar in
  meaning and things that are far are dissimilar in meaning this is kind of how like
  search engines work it's a little goopy um but um what that means is that you can
  take all of the text that was generated and get these embedding vectors which are
  these 1500 long numbers do some weird math to collapse it down into three dimensions
  and then look at the sort of space of conversations that we've been having within
  that sort of strange spatial Dimension um so I did that uh again this is not going
  to make a ton of sense it's going to make a like a strange abstract kind of sense
  um but we're going to we'll come back to this and I'll make it a little bit better
  but basically this this strange orb um one of the many strange orbs I've shown you
  this semester um but this orb uh represents the sort of the threedimensional projection
  of the 1500 dimensional vectors associated with with each of the chats that have
  happened in this class so each one of these little markers and dots represents one
  chat um and sort of its position and the the the I think how did I do this I think
  it's color oh I think each each Channel category pair is a unique color symbol pair
  so all of the blue dots are things that happened in the general text Channel all
  of the purple squares are the center of mass balance channel in the lectures category
  and you can see that they kind of they they lump together so the purples are all
  close to each other um and sort of some of the overlaps are knowable so this or
  interpretable I guess so this orange is from the motor hierarchy lecture it's a
  chat about motor hierarchies in basil gangle from the motor hierarchy lecture which
  shows up here um by the way in the zip file there's an HTML which will open up the
  sphere part of that it won't do this part because I I don't know how to if that
  runs from my computer I will figure out how to share that but you can you could
  if you just open that HTML it'll just be that and it won't have this associated
  with it um but so this is a chat in that channel about motor hierarchies and Basel
  ganglia this one right next door to it I don't know what it is but it's going to
  be similar Huntington's disease and motor control happening in the general text
  channel so there's like down here I have I this I lost some time to it this morning
  this is the the Sea of Bot playground um because I I this is I tried to remove it
  and it caused some problems and so now there's this blob of chats that are not about
  the topic of the course and you can see they're all kind of like stuffed down here
  in this like sad little zone so uh I want to remove them because that is like real
  estate that's not being taken care of um but so this is the general space here is
  called cluster analysis I'm looking for lumps and clusters and large unstructured
  data um and the I think the the next phase of this will be to try to clean up some
  of the technical stuff um but also now that we so this is just the chats but as
  I just mentioned before um we also have your actual individual Student Self user
  self so uh it would not be too hard but I wasn't able to do it today um to basically
  take each of your Associated text gooal and calculate the vector embedding of it
  and then plop those markers on this sphere um and then you know look for some distance
  score and say okay students that are within this range of each other have similar
  interests uh chats that are kind of it would be kind of like if I PL like if one
  of you popped up here then there would be this sort of group of chats that it's
  like hey these things are probably relevant to you this is basically like a recommendation
  system now that I say it out loud it's kind of how like Netflix and stuff works
  like that um but yeah so uh these are also chats I want to also plot the individ
  ual messages within the chat um specifically like the what I've been calling couplets
  which is like you say something and the bot responds so that like two message couplet
  um would be interesting to put on here um and then yeah sort of this is my my homework
  assignment of trying to figure out how to basically how to Wrangle the very large
  unstructured stuff oh another thing I could definitely do um which I've mentioned
  before it's like do a second pass through cuz right now it's processing each text
  blob kind of independently um where it's saying you know for for a given blob of
  text it's like you know just it's extracting all these things independently and
  specifically it's extracting the tags um independently um which is not really ideal
  because it means that there's some there's probably some like synonyms happening
  that could have been the same tag that would lead to better structure uh one second
  um but yeah so I think if I were to go through and do the first pass get all the
  tags and then run that through and say hey AI condense these down into like you
  know 40 or 50 and then replace the ones that are sort of covered so that there's
  a total of like 50 total tags then this would be a much more sort of structured
  mess but uh but yeah uh is that hand what's that so the red dots are what happens
  if I type if I hit groups new group um and I in the in the the group I type file
  colon user ID um which is basically just coloring all the dots associated with files
  that have user ID in the name as red um and if I filter by that and I say only show
  those then this is showing the red dots are the are the the notes damn it I always
  do that it doesn't remember um and then the green ones are the the tag so the the
  the hashtag words yes yes so each I checked the number um I didn't check I didn't
  actually like connect it to your actual ident enties so I don't know which one of
  these is which but uh that is hypothetically there's one dot per human um and then
  there's also one dot per markdown file in this by user folder and if I turn on the
  tags so just view the tags those will show up as green and so the ones that are
  connecting are ones that are shared so all of these connected red dots the AI says
  that when I was looking for tags associated with the words these are all people
  who talked about Neuroscience enough to get a neuroscience tag um and so yeah and
  the again the there's just the limitations in how there's only so much I can do
  with the visualization here but um the big ones are ones that are more connected
  and the small ones are the ones that are like this would be called an orphan because
  it only has actually not an orphan it's just um it's not a connected thing only
  only this user has talked about surgery enough for that to be extracted as a tag
  um so if you're like and what does that all mean it's like I don't know working
  on that this is part of the joy of Discovery is I don't know either um this whole
  thing is basically an experiment in like experimental the term is pedagogy which
  means the teaching of children I don't like that term because it's weird um androgogy
  is a teaching of adults which I think is when I think about it that distinction
  is like I think pedagogi is like much more handh holdy and Andre I think of as like
  I'm going to teach you how to do stuff and then you do that stuff um so it's Andrei
  is like adults so I don't know so this is basically uh trial four in my continued
  exploration of how can we use AI to teach better and burn the world to the ground
  um that's later not out of scope for this class um great okay so uh yeah so you
  can explore the obsidian stuff um you can also theoretically open this HTML file
  and it will open partially that sphere um you are supposed to be confused at this
  point there is not if you're like I don't know what's going on that's correct uh
  we are exploring and confusion is the proper State when when examining anything
  related to the Natural World okay oh and if you're a Cody person um this oh you
  actually may not have this um never mind the the full server data is now 180 gig
  sorry megabytes of just numbers and letters um which is not currently available
  to you but I wouldn't really recommend trying to dig through it anyway it's mostly
  like repeated text and like those many instances of that 1500 uh digit number okay
  cool so eyeballs right got that um I realized that I actually have a where where'd
  you go um I have a video of myself wearing an ey tracker from a previous previous
  life um that I can share a sort of like remind ourselves how eyeballs look um so
  I have I put a lot of stuff on this YouTube account um John math is it probably
  Linked In the server somewhere um it's kind of a way for me to communicate with
  other researchers like the numbers are small but consistent um but there was a time
  in my life when I was making more internet sort of public appealing stuff and one
  of them was this video of me playing OverWatch in my living room in Texas that got
  have 300,000 views um and I think it's like from a different iteration of my life
  where I was like much worse at making these kind of visuals um but it is is it playing
  I guess it's playing at full speed so this is same basic eye tracker slightly different
  visual um and I'm in my apartment in Austin Texas as a post do and I'm calibrating
  to this little I have a laser pointer so I'm using I'm just looking at that and
  I calibrated it after the fact and then this is the the data that I wish I had been
  able to show in real time uh last time uh and it shows the X position so the horizontal
  position is blue so if I look go left to right it'll go the blue will go up and
  down and the Orange is y in that direction there and I'm playing a g playing OverWatch
  is a game where you shoot people with cartoons I don't know um and I'm playing around
  as roadhog who is a character in that game anyone played OverWatch anyone please
  thank you great appreciate it um so video games are a really interesting I think
  just like perceptual motor task because they are like very visually complex but
  the motor commands are are quite limited and the task is often very well defined
  like you have a certain this is a competitive game where you have people trying
  to shoot each other and you go out and so you have this is where the bullets go
  this is your health bar and these are your abilities they you use them and they
  cool down um and this particular character is like big and slow and has like a powerful
  thing here so you can see there's kind of like so the task is very clear of like
  win the game don't get shot so much that your health goes to zero and then use the
  abilities to like stay alive um so first of all you're seeing a lot of this I mentioned
  like people don't blink when they're doing stuff that's hard so all of these kind
  of gaps here are what's happening before the game really starts and you can see
  I'm blinking all over the place eventually people will show up and I have to play
  the game and I start blinking a lot less um so here you have is that yeah so in
  YouTube you can go frame by frame with period and comma if you didn't know that
  um so you see kind of like as I'm coming around this corner here I sort of Scot
  over look through that thing you can see the jumps down here I guess I'm recording
  this at 30 FPS which is unfortunate so those little jumps are sads um and and so
  yeah so you see here coming here's a big jump in X and Y at the same time which
  is a diagonal um so it's going to be positive x negative y so it's going to be I
  guess in that direction yeah so that's yeah that's so this is the first time I look
  down here at the ability so this shape is going to become more familiar because
  this is a diagonal down to this way um and then making a blink during a aod like
  we do and then this is checking the other side which is the health bar and then
  back to Center uh we tend to really like our eyes to be in the middle of our head
  um this is our strong preference so when we're making eye movements in the real
  world uh there is a pattern that is a stereotype pattern of if I'm trying to redirect
  my body in a particular direction my eyes will go there then my head will go there
  and then my body will go there and then I'll move so there's kind of a a trade-off
  there where the to you want to get the information before you initiate the action
  and you move the fastest moving things first um but this is yeah then so oops and
  I'm shooting this guy here see another one of those shapes coming up that's going
  to be cuz because they tend to start from The Middle um that actually those are
  positional so that so if the two dots are here and here that's going to be the same
  place every time so this one is going to be to the same location as that one and
  this sad you could you know 33 milliseconds per Gap there um so because I think
  I had already like thrown the hook and so I'm fighting this big scary one and I
  have to like am I ready can I do it again so I look down uh and then yeah actually
  that's that same pattern so it's like Center to the bottom left to the yeah and
  then making these cads here so this four in a row is a big jump happening um so
  that's 120 milliseconds and you're sort of traveling so that's a big CAD uh the
  actual image on my retina is blurring when that happens um because of just the movements
  happening there um okay I'll let let this play a little more here we have one two
  3 three little sads oh so this is as I'm turning around a corner so another thing
  I find I've mentioned this before like the amount of information we get in a very
  small amount of time is enough to change our Behavior so each of these little steps
  has four dots on it which is again little right about 150 milliseconds which is
  about as fast as you can move your eyes but enough time to get the information from
  that part of the visual field and here we are blinking I'm in this empty space I'm
  like there's nothing going on I have time to Blink um and so now we have also this
  little curve which the curve I'm not moving my head so it's not v um but I am moving
  the stick on the controller so the world is moving smoothly and I'm going to be
  tracking probably whatever this is as that happens nope guess not but uh yeah so
  running up here then this guy runs out get him shoot him um and so this kind of
  stuff here like the swoopy things I like small CA like small sort of rolls back
  um I I started to associate this with it it's kind of like a Vish type of thing
  V is the head stabilization one um where it's sort of it's not a big CAD it's not
  even a small CAD um it's a it's more of a tracking behavior um there is some object
  on the screen that I am tracking smoothly uh and then making these little things
  little dinky sads here um hard to know exactly what that is but yeah sort of a little
  those are sometimes called catch-up sods in in the context of smooth Pursuit your
  eyes can track the thing but sometimes they track it a bit slower so you'll periodically
  make little catchup cods to sort of like you know I'm tracking this and as it moves
  over my eye lags behind so I'll jump ahead to get on top of it you can kind of see
  that happening here as I'm again coming around this corner because I want to shoot
  this mean Ninja um here's that same pattern again double checking and then I don't
  need to watch the whole thing necessarily but uh so again so this is this is like
  this is behavior this is a a task that I performed a visual motor task that I performed
  at this point several years ago um actually I don't even know when that was 20 some
  20 something that doesn't start with a two uh and the the the sort of the nature
  of the data gives us this really interesting insight into the kind of the cognitive
  task that was being performed um you can see this was something I I had this sort
  of like vague intuition this intention to like do this for different characters
  and sort of uh like get different patterns for each of the different sort of like
  play Styles and stuff like that and it didn't quite work out because for most of
  the players you're mostly just like staring at the center of the screen the whole
  time so you don't get the big jumps this guy in particular just because he has huge
  Health pool and slow coold downs you get that really standard sort of triangle shape
  that I really enjoy um but it's this interesting thing where like you the ability
  just like point a camera at your eyes and the screen uh gives you this readout of
  the physical movements associated with the information gathering process that your
  visual system is made for and the specific sort of like tying in so yeah here I
  am blinking a lot um is this is an interesting one little jaggedy bits here this
  is what it looked like when I was doing those big turns like the this is what that
  looks like again my head is not actually moving so it's not the same behavior but
  it is sort of related I am turning in this case but it's kind of like my eye is
  attaching to a particular part of the world and then sort of Shifting around there
  and so I'll let this play out because it's only a couple more minutes and I'll just
  talk over it um but part of the I think like I I I I like approaching the question
  of how Vision Works from this perspective of looking at it how it's actually used
  in real life or not real life but sort of simulated real life is an act I was alive
  I did I did do that um but in that that approach is um very sorry it's hard not
  to look at it um but the concept of of looking at the going to shad my post-doctoral
  adviser who taught me how to use an ey tracker and also came up with the idea sort
  of her her main her name is Mary heho and her main focus is kind of on uh task Dynamics
  and how the uh so Mary is you know been around for a while I think she's in her
  70s at this point possibly late '70s um and she kind of was one of the first people
  to really start trying to study natural behavior um and people moving we won um
  I think uh right and so notice now too is like now that I'm not now that I'm not
  engaged so Mary studied natural behavior still does um and when she started studying
  it in like you know ' 80s uh she had a lot of people telling her that it's not possible
  like you just you cannot study natural behavior it's too noisy it's not controlled
  the data you're going to get get the data you're going to get is going to be some
  messy nonsense and there's not going to be any way to interpret it um because at
  the time still still now but doubly so back then uh the standard mode of educ of
  of research was highly controlled experiments people in dark rooms head attached
  to a vice of some kind um fixating and doing very very simple experiments of like
  look to the left if the thing is blue look to the right if the thing is red so the
  idea that Mary was going to try to study people who were less constrained was met
  with derision um because the idea was that you're not you're never going to be able
  to get anything meaningful out of data like this that's behavior is too complex
  and so Mary's idea was to focus on the task Dynamics um which is to basically rather
  than focusing on the the biological system on its own think about it in the context
  of what is the task that this organism is trying to actually compete um and what
  are the things that define success and failure on that task and if we think about
  things in that context then the data all of a sudden starts to make a lot more sense
  like if I if I didn't know that the health bar was the health bar was down here
  and the cool Downs are down here this weird shape that keep showing up would just
  be a weird shape that keep showing up but because I know the task I can sort of
  interpret what that is and then if we wanted to we could sort of look at how that
  corresponds to different sort of this stats and the others um and also start asking
  questions about like like the speed at which these sods happens H can sort of you
  know like oh all like the fastest sads are only at this 150 millisecond rate it's
  like oh well there's people doing the proper Neuroscience that tell us that but
  you know that if it's moving that fast then that means that the it's more important
  to get information from multiple places than it is to get really good information
  from one place um and I wanted to show this thing at the end here so now here that
  I'm actually not really engaged in a particular task my eye movements are way more
  all over the place they're far less stereotyped don't see the same shape showing
  up and if you wanted to you could definitely come up with stories about what I'm
  looking at looking at but even here in the same exact task same ex same exact environment
  um you have to start making a bunch of different guesses about why I'm choosing
  to look one place versus the other because we we always have a task every time you're
  anywhere you have a task that you're performing um but if the task is not like difficult
  in time constrained um you're not going to be able to really interpret why I think
  so it's like you know I like looking at people like looking at faces and I'm looking
  at his hands people like looking at faces and hands um looking at the rest of the
  kit and body and whatnot and now it's kind of like looking looking here and so there's
  a lot of research that kind of tries to interpret data like this of just watching
  complicated tasks and watching videos and watching people do things um and this
  is kind of like your pupilometry stuff uh where people you can get the data and
  you can get the you can you can look at it it's the same data type um but actually
  interpreting it becomes much more difficult um because you don't actually know the
  context of what people were doing okay 2:30 12:30 I'm trying to do in time warse
  let's try to yeah okay so task Dynamics and the study of Neuroscience natural Behavior
  Mary heho all good terms to look up um and yeah so now let's look so looking at
  how the the so there's there's kind of these two sides to the question one is like
  how is the physiological system of of vision used in natural tasks and the other
  is what is the actual structure of that thing and how do these two sort of How does
  the structure of the visual system play into to the usage of it in the real world
  and vice versa um and I think that's probably why I often tend to struggle with
  like ordering in this class it's like these are all chicken and egg questions like
  there is no real linear progression that I think makes sense and I think that talking
  about the physiology absent of the behavior is sort of just as lost as the other
  way around so um looking so let's think about eyeballs uh should I draw this draw
  a little bit I I'll get a picture before I draw it why are you going so slow oh
  it's cuz come on man oh wait yeah so uh open Imes new tab so that's an eyeball that's
  the side view cutout of the the thing we've been looking at from the front um and
  the most important thing that you'll notice when you look at human eye tracking
  data is that we point our eyes at things uh and we move them a lot and we point
  the the center little cross we tend to put on the thing that we care the most about
  um where's this line I'm not sure what that line is but this line here so this is
  called the phobia centralis your phobia is a very important part of your visual
  system when you point your eyes at something you're pointing this at that thing
  it is a area of extremely high high density of visual [Music] phobia yeah so your
  phobia phobia means pit and is basically a place where we've moved the goop out
  of way so that we have a better view of the actual photo receptors at the eye um
  I mentioned one point that your eyes are backwards um which is true um rods and
  cones so we've heard of rods and cones these are the things that are sort of uh
  let me do this let's let's Zoom back out here okay so you got your eyeball you got
  your pupil and light comes into the pupil and it'sit the back of your eye um and
  so the rods and cones are basically like your rods are basically little sticks the
  cones are a little bit pointier and in inside of them they have um a bunch of things
  but the most important one okay I got to turn this off I was still running that
  other thing so the options in your eye are the chemicals that actually respond to
  the light and they they look like the hexagons your standard standard hexagon with
  like a sort of long tail coming off of it and you have different types of opsins
  that respond to different types of light when a photon comes and hits it uh the
  opson uh changes shape and so one of the sections become what if it kyru or whatever
  um and sort of changes shape and it gets us kink in it actually think I did this
  backwards I think it starts with a kink and it straightens out when it absorbs a
  light but the idea is that the the energy of the photon of the light induces this
  change in the physical structure the physical chemical chemical structure of the
  opson and that changes its charge and so that charge is what sort of becomes the
  neurochemical Cascade that uh Sor the the the the Cascade of neural firings that
  sort of leads to your perception of light um this is a weird process there's many
  options there sort of you have short medium and long uh cones that resp that correspond
  roughly to red blue and green um your rods are don't have the three colors but they
  only respond to Green um and it's your your night vision is your rods and there's
  a pereni shift that happens when they're trading off from each it's a whole thing
  um but the so basically it's this the the lumpy part of the rods and the cones that
  actually house those opsin in this sort of peaky part here and so you might if you
  were a reasonable person assume that we would want to point that part the photosensitive
  part towards where the light comes from um but that is not actually how our eyes
  are set up um the photo receptors are actually pointing back and then the the wiring
  that comes off of it uh goes back out through and so when the light is coming in
  um it has to pass through the the aons of the neurons attached to the RADS and CS
  rods and cones before it can actually be absorbed um by the by the actual opsins
  in in your eye um and so that is why the phobia so basically every part of your
  visual system is worse than it could be um because the light that you were trying
  to focus has to pass through all of these neuron bodies the of the the the these
  middle layers that have gangling cells stuff like that there's a whole whole lot
  going on there the light has to pass through that before it can get to the actual
  photosensitive area and so the fobia we push that goop to the side so that there's
  an unobstructed path of the that the light can get through the idea of why this
  stuff is that way is it's not to be related to when we crawled out of the ocean
  and our eyes kind of had to we had to carry some water along with us so we could
  focus the light better and something in that process inverted things I don't really
  understand that but uh uh cephalopods like squids and octopuses and cuttlefish their
  I face it's it's faced the right way like their their photo receptors face towards
  the source of light um there's another sort of troubling aspect of this which is
  that if all of the wiring coming off of the back of your photo receptors is sort
  of goes back onto the top of your retina this the thing on the back with the photo
  seis is called the retina at some point it has to punch back through in order to
  become the optic nerve that actually takes the data the neural the we call it data
  who cares the pattern of neural activity associated with the light in the environment
  has to punch back through your retina in order to get back to the the rest of your
  nervous system so that means that there is a blind spot on your retina um where
  you don't have vision and you can find it so if you close your left eye and then
  look at your um so close your left so right eye open look at a your thumb at arms
  length and then with your other hand with your thumb up put it like this and then
  move your thumb to where your knuckle is and it maintain your fixation on that thumb
  so watch me so I'm looking at the thumb and I'm I never stop looking at the thumb
  I line up my thumb here and then I move my thumb to where my knuckle was and if
  you do it right your thumb will disappear okay yeah it's it takes a little practice
  but for me so if I'm looking at this thumb my thumb is not visible to me right here
  it's just a empty empty Block in space um so that's another way to do it is just
  hold your thumbs together um so look at pick your pick the left one so with your
  right eye um focus on this one and then slowly move the other one out while maintaining
  fixation on that thumb and it should disappear anyone getting it yeah it just sort
  of like evaporates it's hard it's hard to maintain fixation on the thing without
  looking over and also your brain fills in the Gap so you kind of have to notice
  that it isn't there uh when you're done here just just look up like a blind spot
  demo and there's some other stuff that will show you there um but it's sort of just
  one of these main it's like a classic thing to show of this like blind spot where
  you don't get visual information but you get information from all around it and
  so but because we have two blind spots and they're not over the same area we we
  can fill in the gaps and there's interesting research on like if you give people
  patterns in the blind spot how will the brain fill in the pattern like it because
  it tends to um and yeah uh so should here's just another example of that so this
  chunky BET right here is your optic nerve and that's the part that goes from your
  that takes so you're when you're looking at stuff you're looking at it with your
  phobia um periperal periperal Vision Wikipedia I'm looking for particular image
  here um this is roughly speaking your uh field of view for for I think this is per
  I um in this Central zone right here it's actually not going to be visible here
  so this is 30 20 10 probably 5 so probably right around this circle here that's
  roughly speaking your phobia um you also have your fola which is like a smaller
  area within that space um and then sort of others Z so we have pretty wide vision
  I mean you know I can see my hands out to here and if I Wile my finger so you can
  just like interesting games you can play with yourself just kind of like move your
  hands until you can't see them and then wiggle your fingers and then you can see
  them because we are more sensitive to Motion in the periphery um and also notice
  that it's not this is not a circle it's not a ISO like the central part is circular
  but the whole field of view is laterally oriented because we live in a world that
  is tends to be laterally oriented um and so our sensitivity is sort of it's not
  arranged in a sort of circle around our phobia um it is horizontally distributed
  U we are also Vision oriented Predators so we have a different field of view than
  if we were um you rodents or equines like goats have the rectangular eyes mice have
  the eyes that point out to the side um all these cases of like the Ecology of how
  the animal uses Vision in its ecological niche uh shapes the way that the information
  that the visual system is set up and as I said before I think I'm not sure if I
  said it today but it's it Bears repeating that fobia is again roughly the size of
  your thumbnail at arms length um it takes up roughly 1% of your visual field roughly
  50% of your visual cortex is devoted to processing the information from that small
  spot there um so that is that concept is called cortical magnification um and it's
  kind of why I feel somewhat com comfortable um with these representations that as
  a as I said like I this circle is roughly the size of the phobia um plus or minus
  one visual degree um and I think representations like this overemphasize that fobal
  perspective because we are getting information from the whole thing from the whole
  field of view um but it is nonetheless I think it's valuable to look at the location
  of that sort of directed visual Focus because that is basically an indication of
  this is the part of the visual field that my nervous system wanted information from
  at this time and I think that concept is very important because it's like I could
  have looked anywhere and you know but I have to look somewhere and so my cognitive
  system sort of makes these little decisions about where the information like where
  in the world do I want to pull information from um and you know if I'm just sitting
  around you know doing not not so much those decisions are not particularly uh costly
  but as the task becomes more hard and as the as you sort of start doing more and
  more complex and difficult Behavior the choices of where to look one place versus
  the other can be is very um critical uh show this briefly then I'll what we doing
  on time I won't show this I'll come back to it later in the semester when I we look
  back at the my main research from this era was like visual control of foot placement
  and looking at the patterns of path on the ground when you're choosing footholds
  walking over rough Terrain in that kind of context you only have about you know
  400 milliseconds per step and you have to find a location on very rough terrain
  that you're you can support your whole body or you'll fall into a river and break
  your leg um so that the sort of yeah the niess that there is a aspect where you
  can um you can get basically a readout of that cognitive question of where in the
  environment do I want information from um because we are highly fiated IM ey Focus
  uh Predators we have this nice feature where we can point a camera at the eyeballs
  do some old school computer vision um to get the pupil Center here and then get
  a measure both of where the eyes are pointing not not only where the eyes are pointing
  but where in the environment did my central nervous system want to get information
  about to complete whatever task it is I'm doing um yeah so I think I can draw fast
  enough for this the internet is already drawn all the pictures I could care about
  um optic kaym stop it with the AI so so so you got your eyeballs and you got the
  optic nerves that come in and there's this part in the middle here where things
  kind of split apart um and that is called the optic kaym it is optic kaym ioy so
  Imam was a Islamic scholar in 7 Century uh Iraq um and he discovered optic kaym
  by doing just old school physiology um so Imam has been called the father of Optics
  he basically invented Optics he is credited as the person who discovered that light
  was a thing that you can like measure and do science about like refraction and stuff
  like that that um and it was later his work was later rediscovered um by good old
  Des cartez um and translate one of dayarts so dayart you know of cartisian coordinates
  Fame one of his main things was he was a polyglot he spoke a ton of languages and
  so a lot of his claim to fame was that he would find these old records written in
  Arabic and translate them into Latin and then once it's Latin all the Europeans
  are like wow day cart you're so smart um so this is the model of the eye you can
  sort of see it's got Vitus humor cornea this was the um so uh the lens so IAM got
  everything basically right but he didn't understand how the lens worked um so he
  just had some comment in this thing that there's some probably some Demon that lives
  in there and bends the light cuz back back in the day when you didn't know what
  something how something worked you just said the little demon does that part like
  the rest of it I can do math about um but that part there's some Demon doing stuff
  um but you can see kind of all these parts and then these uh what's it called um
  these are like the muscles and stuff like that and yeah and he's on money in Iraq
  good for him uh iel heam is his Arabic name you'll often see it or alhazen is for
  some reason the English term um but yeah and so this is a good representation so
  showing how things split and so there's this distinction between your visual Fields
  um and how they map to different parts of your brain so this part I will draw because
  I think it's helpful but um because we tend to think of as like because we have
  a right eye and a left eye right shocking um godamn okay so that's one eye that's
  the other eye oops and this is our brain as seen from above um so you have left
  hemisphere right hemisphere I don't know why this is my text stack is struggling
  um and so so like there's lateralization in the brain so like your right hand is
  controlled by your left hemisphere for some for some reason um and so sort of a
  naive view might be to think that it's just like the same for your eyes like your
  left eye connects to your right hemisphere um but it is not actually how that works
  uh because your left hemisphere so your visual cortex is here in the back um and
  your left hemisphere handles the right visual field not the right eye so if I want
  to know about the things that are over here um I don't necessarily want to know
  about what's going on in this eye but as they project let's pretend I move my eyes
  um they're going to project on so from the right side it's going to project onto
  the left side of each eyeball and so we need right so this is the right I'm super
  dyslexic so this is hard uh so the right the projections from the right visual field
  need to make it to the left visual cortex so these ones can go straight back and
  these ones have to cross over and so then if you want to know about stuff going
  on from the left visual field gu I got to figure out how this stupid thing works
  come on so this is the so this is an object in my left visual field um and that's
  projecting onto the right side of each eye so that is the left it has to get to
  the right hemisphere so these ones can go straight back and this one can cross over
  and that's this crossing over point there that's called that's the optic kaym um
  the kaym is actually the The Crossing part but the yeah so this is the this is how
  those literal wiring like the literal likey back in the 7th century was just cutting
  open heads and looking at where the the the the optic nerve is like a tough thing
  like if you ever find yourself in a butcher shop or a pig roast and you feel like
  being like weird and gross you can go check it out um but it's a very fibrous and
  dense thing so if you just like open up the head and just see where it goes you
  can see that it splits apart and then crosses over and then these little guys right
  here are the um is that Thalamus um I think that is a Thalamus which is kind of
  like a way station all your senses go through the thalamus except for smell uh because
  smell is chemo sensation sensation of chemicals in the environment the the story
  is that that's that is the oldest sense that like bacteria have smell because they're
  detecting chemical gradients and so that is the only one that doesn't go through
  the whatever the thalamus stuff um but anyways it goes through here this there's
  we stuff that happens here like motion s sensitivity stuff can happen there the
  whole thing of you're more sensitive to this or that there's also some tracks that
  sort of now but so these ones are going to going going back to the visual cortex
  proper which is the thing that lives on the back of your brain and then this is
  where you also get actually some of these tracks don't go to your cortex I don't
  think some of some of them don't even go to the thalamus some of them go like straight
  into the spine and straight into like they bypass cortex and give you things like
  the startle response that happen where visual information makes you move and do
  like ah stuff like that a lot of like balance stuff has subcortical Pathways that
  bypass the brain and just go straight down to the spine um oh this is a good image
  this what I was looking for um oh lateral geniculate body my bad um but yeah so
  this is this is what you will generally see as the visual path but there are subcortical
  Pathways that bypass all of the the big pink wrinkly bit on top um oh yeah you also
  have a blind spot because you have a nose like there's just a part of your visual
  feel that just like never really has anything going on um so that's kind of I find
  funny um yeah uh subcortical pathways are interesting um and what else do I want
  to show here I'm kind of trying to checkbox some things here just because the main
  thing to sort of to remember here is the this concept of visual field kind of quadrants
  sort of or or not quadrants necess but like just the idea that you're the retina
  and the visual Fields have kind of a complic ated relationship that is sort of there
  a lot of mirroring that happens where you see the picture of like now the the tree
  is upside down because of how lenses work so you can see like the lower visual field
  here is on the top down there um so there's this sort of spatial correspondence
  between um there's a bunch of different angles going on here one is the anatomical
  structure of the eye itself the other is like the visual field relative to your
  body I guess so like if I'm sitting here moving my eyes around like my visual field
  kind of moves with my eyes but my visual environment does not so there's sort of
  complicated playoff there um and that structure is kind of maintained as it gets
  back into back through this the the the good oldfashioned just physics and Optics
  and into the weird goopy electric meatloaf um that spatial structure of the visual
  environment is sort of maintained um in these kind of weird like split apart and
  stuff like that so that by the time you get back to the V1 visual cortex visual
  CeX uh what was I look for cortical expansion what am I looking for here um am I
  not finding this picture I feel like I'm being let down by people who put pictures
  from Neuroscience books on what am I missing here feel like why am I not being able
  to find this retinotopic that's retinotopy that's the term I was looking for sorry
  retinotopy that's the term I was looking for and not able to find um so the the
  concept the main concept that to think about here is that there is a retinotopic
  map um kind of similar to the cartoon of the motor the sensory motor culous the
  horrible guy that lives in your motor cortex who has giant hands and giant mouth
  because that's where we have our most sensitivity in terms of sensation and movement
  um there is also a kind of map in your visual cortex that corresponds to your visual
  field and they're sort of the the cartoons that we draw about it look a lot like
  this and similar to the horrible man that lives in your head um horrible person
  that lives in your head and sort of is the sort of the cartoon monster that represents
  your Sentry motor sensitiv this is also not it's like we love this story it's a
  great story it's in every textbook um and it's true to a certain extent but the
  the data looks more goopy than that like it's not this like perfect beautiful map
  it's like it's it's more of of this type of thing oh was that know this person um
  and so if you uh so this representation of the brain by the way the the black spots
  are the are the pits and then the white spots are the tops so you basically take
  the brain and like expand it out that's what this represents um and so this is stimulating
  in the visual field and having this not particular not my favorite color map um
  you can see that there is kind of a a a striation that happens there where there
  is that different parts tend to correspond to different parts of the visual field
  um but it is complicated um uh this is a very famous image I think it may have won
  a Nobel Prize I'm not quite sure but this is showing the um Superior calculus of
  a monkey and they yeah retinotopic organization and what they did is they were they
  were they were stimulating in the monkeys so Superior calculus handles eye movements
  um and they stimulated like little electrical signals to the to the cortex and generated
  eye movements that sort of mapped that pattern so also in the same way that there's
  like both the sensory cortex and the motor cortex and they're kind of paired to
  each other uh the visual perception system and the ocular motor movement system
  are also kind of paired through these retinotopic Maps um because if I have you
  know if there's if I'm looking here and there's something in the periphery that
  I want to see this retinotopic location sort of you know I'm I'm fixating here but
  there's some bright little shiny thing that shows up in the upper right that is
  also the coordinates that I need to know to make an eye movement to fixate on that
  thing so there's this there's a linked map that I've been talking about V1 which
  is that's the stuff in the back of the brain um that's your perceptual system that
  is not your ocula motor system that ocul motor system is more spread out and weird
  um we're going to talk more about that during next class we talk about um we're
  going to briefly talk about it in the evolution chat um well here's a nice sort
  of different animals have different sort of shaped visual fields and stuff like
  that um but yeah so um so yeah so there's kind of a a general sort of like a complicated
  relationship between the physiology of the eye in terms of the optical characteristics
  of how the light bends and all that kind of stuff um the physiology of the retina
  which is the part of your visual the part of your eye that actually responds to
  like that's the part where you have neurons in your eye like there's an argument
  that you're that your eyeballs should be considered a part of your censor your central
  nervous system because even though we think of them as kind of peripheral they're
  they do computation on the retinal gangan cells um so there is processing that happens
  like in these the middle layer so if you want to know that's like the term there
  so in the in the retina you have the photo receptors you have the optic nerve and
  then you have these like middle layers you have there's like something like 60 some
  different cell types in the middle layers some of them are connecting uh the neuron
  the the photo receptors to the the the optic nerve bodies some of them are connecting
  to each other some of them have long short middle term distances um recently was
  discovered that some of these middle layer cells are sensitive to light um specifically
  blue light and they're thought to be related to our circadian rhythms um but there's
  yeah and then retinol gangan cells retinol gangan gangan cells um yeah so horizontal
  cells which connect them to each other and so the the there is like processing that
  happens on here and it has to do with a number of different sort of like like it
  it's it's a little mysterious about what all is actually happening in there but
  you it leads to a lot of uh famous Illusions shman grid Illusions uh which for some
  of y'all with Mac computers will have this in directly available so stuff like this
  which you may have seen before open image in new tab so each one of these circles
  is white but as you are looking at one of them the periphery will be dark um Herman
  grid uh famous illusion that illusion is happening at the level of your retina because
  of lateral inhibition and sort of in the periphery the the black of the square kind
  of overlaps with the white so there suppression that happens but only in the periphery
  because when you're fixating on it your phobia is small enough to have enough resolution
  there but bunch of weird little Illusions happening there so so yeah 110 I think
  I think I'll probably leave that brain dump there that's probably enough to enough
  to chew on um and enough sort of relevant relevant terms there so you got uh the
  task Dynamics thing in terms of the actual usage you have the the physiology of
  the eye you have this concept of lateralization and um the optic kaym and the the
  the retinotopic mapping between your visual fields and your your uh your visual
  cortex um got the middle layers going on in the strange cacophony of your retina
  you have the blind spot um you have all the you neurons there um and yeah you have
  the ocular motor system and in particular if you want to know more about that Superior
  culus uh which handles the um oculo oculo motor retino topy yes yeah and so like
  the that relationship between like the retinotopic aspects of your perceptual system
  and then the retinotopic aspects of your ocul motor system and sort of how those
  things play together um and none of that has anything to do with movement um I guess
  IM movements have stuff to do with movement and often times people will talk about
  eye movements as body movements um and they technically are but the question of
  sort of how this information actually makes it into your body and actually allows
  you know like how does the information get from your visual system down to whatever
  system is handling like throws and catches and stuff like that um we can it has
  to do with your prial Lo probably prial cortex also has to do with a bunch of subcortical
  Pathways um and also your the cortical spinal tract which I realiz I I said wrong
  about that I said like only humans have it it's not true a lot of animals have it
  it's just that we have it's to greater or lesser extent um so like quadrip PEDs
  in particular like cats and dogs have a very minimal one and more complex not complex
  but animals that use their for lims more tend to have more um and uh something else
  going to say there um and it has to do with sensation it's a it's apparently a direct
  mapping from your motor cortex cortico spinal tract so it's a direct mapping from
  your motor cortex down to your spine so you can have like a very short uh synaptic
  Loop between the sensory information that you get from your body and your motor
  commands that sort of respond quickly to things that don't have to Route all the
  way through the weird complex wetwear because that's a very slow route like things
  that go through the cortex take about 200ish milliseconds to really like get all
  the the way through and this is that this is the visual representation of how that
  thing mentioned mentioned before okay um all right I'm going to stop there um and
  let's do what has now become somewhat stereotype behavior of 2024 D1 D no not- 1105
  visual neuroscience and um yeah in the 10 minutes we have left uh please just do
  the thing we've been doing of just pop in there and uh just ask the bot about the
  stuff that I've been saying I said a lot of stuff on a lot of different many different
  layers of uh sort of cl cl Clarity um so but you can kind of see how this game is
  going now like it's it's this is less about trying to get specific high quality
  text written in there and more an opportunity for me to filter the stuff that I've
  been saying through your individual nervous system so I can get a sense of where
  people's interests are and um also as we have learned it tends to gum up when it
  gets slammed like this so just give it a second to catch up um and let's do that
  for 10 minutes I've noticed that some of yall are not all the chats come from class
  time which I appreciate uh so feel free to go and yeah dump dump data into the machine
  as much as you can and uh yeah I think by the end of the semester we're getting
  some good some good structures out okay cool

  text: and recording great hello everybody Welcome to whatever today may bring um
    yikes so uh let's see a lot of things a lot of sort of technical things that nobody
    asked for have been partially completed um so today the topic of the day will
    be eyeballs um specifically like the basic biology Neuroscience of how your eyeballs
    work and connect to your brain all that kind of stuff um and we're going to get
    to that but that's that's going to be another kind of like in the spirit of the
    motor hierarchy thing where I have less prepared because I was making these things
    um but this is a topic I know a lot about and so this is some some mainly going
    to be trying to give like a large scale overview of all of the relevant of as
    many of the relevant parts to Vision as we can get to um and then sort of see
    where that gets us uh and then next week we'll talk about Evolution and then we'll
    take stock from there because there's a couple other things I want to get done
    this semester um at this point in semester y'all are probably wondering about
    your grades don't worry about your grades just show up check boxes you're fine
    um the concept of grading is about ordering you relative to your performance relative
    to your peers and I just don't think that's a valuable form of Education um there's
    a really awful but very formative paper written in 1970 called higher education
    as a filter written by Kenneth filter Kenneth no Kenneth arrow with the premise
    being that what we're supposed to do in higher ed is give you guys a chance to
    outcompete your peers so that the purchasers of Labor know which one of you are
    the good ones who are worth the money and uh that in general and that's not what
    I like doing in my job um I do not care about how you perform relative to each
    other I don't even know what performance would mean in this context um so don't
    worry about it talk to the bot as long as you as long as you have like at least
    a thousand words written in this in the server which I'm pretty sure almost all
    of you already have um you're fine even that like just that's you'll be fine if
    if anyone is a problem I'll let you know and say hey just check some boxes so
    that I don't so I could stand up to audit I guess if I need to As Long As I don't
    record it and put it online anywhere um yeah so don't stress dear thing uh I'm
    sure you have plenty of other parts of your life that are adding stress so focus
    on those um education doesn't have to hurt learning doesn't have to be a painful
    process if you feel that here doing great okay where are we

  text: now so um I did a big refactor of the AI code uh refactor in the context of
    code and software basically means like redoing it like rewriting it like changing
    the structure up cleaning things out it was kind of a lot of like code that I
    wrote Under duress like at sort of like over the past several years in various
    classes so when there's a very important rule that you unfortunately are also
    not really prepared they're not it's not really a part of the undergraduate education
    to focus on things that last for longer than a semester um and you guys are really
    given this I think pretty awful approach to productivity which is like here's
    a shortterm hard deadline get it over the case throw it away start again from
    scratch and if you're going to be working on something you work on it a lot for
    a long time and then it'll get better and better and blah blah blah that's not
    really how the world tends to work typically things are much more iterative and
    you sort of work on the same thing over and over again um and when that happens
    you can kind of get to this point where you're kind of like blocked by your own
    work um in software they call it Tech debt like you have a bunch of like slop
    that you every little sloppy decision you made along the way kind of builds up
    um and so it's very important to like often just like take a step back and kind
    of like restart um it's again a very counterintuitive thing that it like like
    throwing all your work away and starting again from scratch is often a very productive
    way to live your life because often when you start a project it's more Discovery
    and then once you kind of know what the structure is recreating it with the end
    point and the starting point known can often lead to much cleaner work all that
    is to say um I rewrote the code and now it does some neat stuff um well it does
    the same things this one of the frustrating about refactoring code it actually
    has very similar functionality but now it's cleaner you can build off of it and
    one of the things I built off of it was uh looking per student um so and then
    some other stuff which I will show you shortly so let's take a quick um quick
    sort of pass through that do time okay yeah yeah I'm not going to get too into
    the Weeds on this although we want to uh so most recent server thing same as before
    just download it here um there might be a couple extra things in the zip file
    but don't stress about that and so grab that and if you open it now in obsidian
    uh open folder as a vault paste that go there

  text: uh probably actually this one yeah select that it's white always white I don't
    know why actually not always white always white on this computer when I open a
    new one while my other computer doesn't do that dark mode because light is effort
    um okay uh so it's quite similar um to before um the main difference is I also
    change the way that I do the like the call to open AI to do the AI analysis stuff
    um and the new way should be cleaner it should like have less slop um hard to
    tell numerically but just generally should be more robust and also now there's
    this server there's this little U what's it called folder called by user which
    is basically I I went through in every chat that your IDE appeared in is sort
    of smushed into there um I didn't really do any anything beyond that uh and so
    there's a bunch of files in there they're user idore and like your Discord user
    ID um uh because the other thing I did is by so with the way that this like weird
    world of AI text analysis Works um you can kind of do the the scale of the text
    is you can be pretty like goall about it like you just make kind of a machine
    to analyze the text you just throw different Blobs of text into it so up until
    this point the only analysis was done at the chat level so at the level of those
    threads you were sort of doing summaries and pulling out things that look like
    this um but part of the refactoring was making it more generic which is often
    what happens um and so now it's also set up that instead of dropping in a chat
    I can also drop in like every blob text in a particular category um so this is
    I'm actually not sure so this is basically like the summary of the text channels
    category which is not a very exciting one um but the so every folder with a category
    also has a thing says category index um and this is the summary of everything
    that happened in that category and then you can also go into individual channels
    and channel index so it's the same thing so it's kind of this there's this multiscale
    thing happening here which I think is kind of a very general idea in a lot of
    the natural world where you have this kind of like the term is like scale-free
    structure where you can do the same analysis on zoomed in version of the thing
    as well as the zoomed out version of the thing um so and then yeah and then that
    does sort of interesting thing to uh yeah so and then by user or know what this
    is going to look like yeah I

  text: don't I don't actually this person see it's like this it looks like this person
    only has one chat but I don't trust the code enough to trust that so if that is
    you and you have more we'll probably clean that up um but yeah so theoretically
    you should be in there so now if you look at the graph view we again get just
    the white dots of nothing until we add tags and now we get this kind of thing
    and we can do as well let's see so we can do groups new group and then we look
    for file colon uh user ID and then we can look for file uh channel channel index
    actually just do index and we're getting sort of this interesting kind of structure
    there's still not like a ton of navigability here um largely I think because of
    H obsidian works but basically actually I can do now a search so I so in the filters
    I do file colon user ID user is just kind of a generic term for anybody using
    a thing in this context user kind of means student um I'm also in there uh but
    yeah so now these so the blue dots here are the chats for a given one of you uh
    and I think if you just search for your user ID you'll find yourself um and I'll
    I'll make better ways to navigate this but with oh come on now dang it right so
    groups file user pink bright pink so theoretically here this is also a place that
    I wish that I had more control over like what is visible at which point and you
    know like I wish I could make the tags have less pole than the other ones but
    that's kind of limitation of uh obsidian but

  text: this is a you doing that oh text fate distance be brighter okay Center Force
    so this is now starting to get at like a map of y'all's actual proper interests
    so if I hover over one of these pink ones which are the students um this particular
    person has interest in so things like Neuroscience are obviously very highly connected
    because everyone has been talking about Neuroscience stuff um and just so again
    just to be clear this sort of summary of a given person is every single chat all
    the text of every chat that they have even been tangentially a part of so if you
    even just sent one message and one in like a 50 message Chat that's all in here
    um and then it runs through and says hey give me a give me a title give me an
    extremely short summary give me some highlights give me a very short summary blah
    blah blah blah blah um so these are the things so for you these are the things
    that just emerg from the statistics of what you were talking to the machine about
    um and like lose again damn it that is so annoying a file user user all right
    it's fine poies to any red green color bind people in the room um so for example
    good old user 12830 95453 45953 3792 uh has the main tags that came out of them
    which again like don't if if your favorite thing didn't come out if the thing
    if like if you don't think this is a good representation of you um just know that
    it's like the bot's kind of dumb like it it doesn't know like it can't tell if
    you're excited it can't tell like if it's if it if you said something and it said
    a bunch of stuff about something you don't care about it can't tell that cuz those
    words are in the data um so this will person so 53792 is the last digits has an
    interest has interest in Neuroscience epidemiology public health and hallucinations
    this is one of those where like that's the only epidemiology which I know isn't
    true because I know that y'all been talking about that but like pick this person
    over here um you know so they so they they're now so the motor hierarchy tag is
    connecting these two people um and you know so like all of these people

  text: have said enough about biomechanics that it showed up in their message uh
    or in their summary um this this one motor control so theoretically um not quite
    yet but this is kind of a it's a landscape of like an interest map so this is
    sort of it's different I think like these are not because if your guys are because
    there's in the the larger scale thing in all of this this is everything that was
    discussed at all like this was the total conversation and a lot of this could
    be cleaned up blah blah blah um here the the gray dots are just any chat um but
    once you start looking at the the statistics of the user based stuff we start
    to get the things that like hypothetically like if you are going around and every
    time you're in a chat you mention epidemiology it's going to show up here differently
    than would show up in the general statistics because we're now grouping by particular
    factors and that particular factor is roughly one per human um so that's cool
    uh so we can navigate that and um sort of uh I need to make a better like interface
    for navigating that but it is technically there uh the other thing that I did
    is related to this concept so this is this is the place where I'm not going to
    go down this rabbit hole although I will do it later in the semester um we've
    talked a bit about 3D space and sort of like objects exist in 3D space and you
    can have XYZ data and in spatial Dimensions so if you're thinking about data if
    you have up to three dimensions you can plot that spatially by just putting XYZ
    as you know length width height or whatever um and so if you have two data points
    in a three-dimensional space you can measure distances between them um which is
    you know ukian geometry not particularly exciting or it is exciting but it's probably
    not it's probably familiar um there's a there's a strange corollary to that in
    this world of AI natural language processing um that relates to the concept of
    an embedding um and basically in the same way that each one of those Blobs of
    text can be attached to uh can we keep run through that summarization scheme you
    can also get the the embedding of that blob of text within the very high dimensional
    space of the language that the language model has access to um I'm not going to
    be able to say this in any way that makes sense in the short in a briefly but
    basically instead of being like threedimensional things like each blob of text
    that an AI an open AI B llm processes is embedded in a 1532 dimensional space
    so 1,53 too and so a

  text: given blob of text gets put into that space and the that location in that
    super high dimensional space has something to do with its meaning and in that
    space you can also do things like measure distances and see like things that are
    close together are similar in meaning and things that are far are dissimilar in
    meaning this is kind of how like search engines work it's a little goopy um but
    um what that means is that you can take all of the text that was generated and
    get these embedding vectors which are these 1500 long numbers do some weird math
    to collapse it down into three dimensions and then look at the sort of space of
    conversations that we've been having within that sort of strange spatial Dimension
    um so I did that uh again this is not going to make a ton of sense it's going
    to make a like a strange abstract kind of sense um but we're going to we'll come
    back to this and I'll make it a little bit better but basically this this strange
    orb um one of the many strange orbs I've shown you this semester um but this orb
    uh represents the sort of the threedimensional projection of the 1500 dimensional
    vectors associated with with each of the chats that have happened in this class
    so each one of these little markers and dots represents one chat um and sort of
    its position and the the the I think how did I do this I think it's color oh I
    think each each Channel category pair is a unique color symbol pair so all of
    the blue dots are things that happened in the general text Channel all of the
    purple squares are the center of mass balance channel in the lectures category
    and you can see that they kind of they they lump together so the purples are all
    close to each other um and sort of some of the overlaps are knowable so this or
    interpretable I guess so this orange is from the motor hierarchy lecture it's
    a chat about motor hierarchies in basil gangle from the motor hierarchy lecture
    which shows up here um by the way in the zip file there's an HTML which will open
    up the sphere part of that it won't do this part because I I don't know how to
    if that runs from my computer I will figure out how to share that but you can
    you could if you just open that HTML it'll just be that and it won't have this
    associated with it um but so this is a chat in that channel about motor hierarchies
    and Basel ganglia this one right next door to it I don't know what it is but it's
    going to be similar Huntington's disease and motor control

  text: happening in the general text channel so there's like down here I have I this
    I lost some time to it this morning this is the the Sea of Bot playground um because
    I I this is I tried to remove it and it caused some problems and so now there's
    this blob of chats that are not about the topic of the course and you can see
    they're all kind of like stuffed down here in this like sad little zone so uh
    I want to remove them because that is like real estate that's not being taken
    care of um but so this is the general space here is called cluster analysis I'm
    looking for lumps and clusters and large unstructured data um and the I think
    the the next phase of this will be to try to clean up some of the technical stuff
    um but also now that we so this is just the chats but as I just mentioned before
    um we also have your actual individual Student Self user self so uh it would not
    be too hard but I wasn't able to do it today um to basically take each of your
    Associated text gooal and calculate the vector embedding of it and then plop those
    markers on this sphere um and then you know look for some distance score and say
    okay students that are within this range of each other have similar interests
    uh chats that are kind of it would be kind of like if I PL like if one of you
    popped up here then there would be this sort of group of chats that it's like
    hey these things are probably relevant to you this is basically like a recommendation
    system now that I say it out loud it's kind of how like Netflix and stuff works
    like that um but yeah so uh these are also chats I want to also plot the individ
    ual messages within the chat um specifically like the what I've been calling couplets
    which is like you say something and the bot responds so that like two message
    couplet um would be interesting to put on here um and then yeah sort of this is
    my my homework assignment of trying to figure out how to basically how to Wrangle
    the very large unstructured stuff oh another thing I could definitely do um which
    I've mentioned before it's like do a second pass through cuz right now it's processing
    each text blob kind of independently um where it's saying you know for for a given
    blob of text it's like you know just it's extracting all these things independently
    and specifically it's extracting the tags um independently um which is not really
    ideal because it means that there's some there's probably some like synonyms happening
    that could have been the same tag that would lead to better structure uh one second
    um but

  end: 1620.0
  start: 1440.0
  text: yeah so I think if I were to go through and do the first pass get all the
    tags and then run that through and say hey AI condense these down into like you
    know 40 or 50 and then replace the ones that are sort of covered so that there's
    a total of like 50 total tags then this would be a much more sort of structured
    mess but uh but yeah uh is that hand what's that so the red dots are what happens
    if I type if I hit groups new group um and I in the in the the group I type file
    colon user ID um which is basically just coloring all the dots associated with
    files that have user ID in the name as red um and if I filter by that and I say
    only show those then this is showing the red dots are the are the the notes damn
    it I always do that it doesn't remember um and then the green ones are the the
    tag so the the the hashtag words yes yes so each I checked the number um I didn't
    check I didn't actually like connect it to your actual ident enties so I don't
    know which one of these is which but uh that is hypothetically there's one dot
    per human um and then there's also one dot per markdown file in this by user folder
    and if I turn on the tags so just view the tags those will show up as green and
    so the ones that are connecting are ones that are shared so all of these connected
    red dots the AI says that when I was looking for tags associated with the words
    these are all people who talked about Neuroscience enough to get a neuroscience
    tag um and so yeah and the again the there's just the limitations in how there's
    only so much I can do with the visualization here but um the big ones are ones
    that are more connected and the small ones are the ones that are like this would
    be called an orphan because it only has actually not an orphan it's just um it's
    not a connected thing only only this user has talked about surgery enough for
    that to be extracted as a tag um so if you're like and what does that all mean
    it's like I don't know working on that this is part of the joy of Discovery is
    I don't know either um this whole thing is basically an experiment in like experimental
    the term is pedagogy which means the teaching of children I don't like that term
    because it's weird um androgogy is a teaching of adults which I think is when
    I think about it that

    I think of as like I'm going to teach you how to do stuff and then you do that

    trial four in my continued exploration of how can we use AI to teach better and
    burn the world to the ground um that's later not out of scope for this class um
    great okay so uh yeah so you can explore the obsidian stuff um you can also theoretically
    open this HTML file and it will open partially that sphere um you are supposed
    to be confused at this point there is not if you're like I don't know what's going
    on that's correct uh we are exploring and confusion is the proper State when when
    examining anything related to the Natural World okay oh and if you're a Cody person
    um this oh you actually may not have this um never mind the the full server data
    is now 180 gig sorry megabytes of just numbers and letters um which is not currently
    available to you but I wouldn't really recommend trying to dig through it anyway
    it's mostly like repeated text and like those many instances of that 1500 uh digit
    number okay cool so eyeballs right got that um I realized that I actually have
    a where where'd you go um I have a video of myself wearing an ey tracker from
    a previous previous life um that I can share a sort of like remind ourselves how
    eyeballs look um so I have I put a lot of stuff on this YouTube account um John
    math is it probably Linked In the server somewhere um it's kind of a way for me
    to communicate with other researchers like the numbers are small but consistent
    um but there was a time in my life when I was making more internet sort of public
    appealing stuff and one of them was this video of me playing OverWatch

  text: in my living room in Texas that got have 300,000 views um and I think it's
    like from a different iteration of my life where I was like much worse at making
    these kind of visuals um but it is is it playing I guess it's playing at full
    speed so this is same basic eye tracker slightly different visual um and I'm in
    my apartment in Austin Texas as a post do and I'm calibrating to this little I
    have a laser pointer so I'm using I'm just looking at that and I calibrated it
    after the fact and then this is the the data that I wish I had been able to show
    in real time uh last time uh and it shows the X position so the horizontal position
    is blue so if I look go left to right it'll go the blue will go up and down and
    the Orange is y in that direction there and I'm playing a g playing OverWatch
    is a game where you shoot people with cartoons I don't know um and I'm playing
    around as roadhog who is a character in that game anyone played OverWatch anyone
    please thank you great appreciate it um so video games are a really interesting
    I think just like perceptual motor task because they are like very visually complex
    but the motor commands are are quite limited and the task is often very well defined
    like you have a certain this is a competitive game where you have people trying
    to shoot each other and you go out and so you have this is where the bullets go
    this is your health bar and these are your abilities they you use them and they
    cool down um and this particular character is like big and slow and has like a
    powerful thing here so you can see there's kind of like so the task is very clear
    of like win the game don't get shot so much that your health goes to zero and
    then use the abilities to like stay alive um so first of all you're seeing a lot
    of this I mentioned like people don't blink when they're doing stuff that's hard
    so all of these kind of gaps here are what's happening before the game really
    starts and you can see I'm blinking all over the place eventually people will
    show up and I have to play the game and I start blinking a lot less um so here
    you have is that yeah so in YouTube you can go frame by frame with period and
    comma if you didn't know that um so you see kind of like as I'm coming around
    this corner here I sort of Scot over look through that thing you can see the jumps
    down here I guess I'm recording this at 30 FPS which is unfortunate so those little
    jumps are sads um and and so yeah so you see here coming here's a big jump in
    X and Y at the same time which is a diagonal um so

    direction yeah so that's yeah that's so this is the first time I look down here
    at the ability so this shape is going to become more familiar because this is
    a diagonal down to this way um and then making a blink during a aod like we do
    and then this is checking the other side which is the health bar and then back
    to Center uh we tend to really like our eyes to be in the middle of our head um
    this is our strong preference so when we're making eye movements in the real world
    uh there is a pattern that is a stereotype pattern of if I'm trying to redirect
    my body in a particular direction my eyes will go there then my head will go there
    and then my body will go there and then I'll move so there's kind of a a trade-off
    there where the to you want to get the information before you initiate the action
    and you move the fastest moving things first um but this is yeah then so oops
    and I'm shooting this guy here see another one of those shapes coming up that's
    going to be cuz because they tend to start from The Middle um that actually those
    are positional so that so if the two dots are here and here that's going to be
    the same place every time so this one is going to be to the same location as that
    one and this sad you could you know 33 milliseconds per Gap there um so because
    I think I had already like thrown the hook and so I'm fighting this big scary
    one and I have to like am I ready can I do it again so I look down uh and then
    yeah actually that's that same pattern so it's like Center to the bottom left
    to the yeah and then making these cads here so this four in a row is a big jump
    happening um so that's 120 milliseconds and you're sort of traveling so that's
    a big CAD uh the actual image on my retina is blurring when that happens um because
    of just the movements happening there um okay I'll let let this play a little
    more here we have one two 3 three little sads oh so this is as I'm turning around
    a corner so another thing I find I've mentioned this before like the amount of
    information we get in a very small amount of time is enough to change our Behavior

    from that part of the visual field and here we are blinking I'm in this empty
    space I'm like there's nothing going on I have time to Blink um and so now we
    have also this little curve which the curve I'm not moving my head so it's not
    v um but I am moving the stick on the controller so the world is moving smoothly
    and I'm going to be tracking probably whatever this is as that happens nope guess
    not but uh yeah so running up here then this guy runs out get him shoot him um
    and so this kind of stuff here like the swoopy things I like small CA like small
    sort of rolls back um I I started to associate this with it it's kind of like
    a Vish type of thing V is the head stabilization one um where it's sort of it's
    not a big CAD it's not even a small CAD um it's a it's more of a tracking behavior
    um there is some object on the screen that I am tracking smoothly uh and then
    making these little things little dinky sads here um hard to know exactly what
    that is but yeah sort of a little those are sometimes called catch-up sods in
    in the context of smooth Pursuit your eyes can track the thing but sometimes they
    track it a bit slower so you'll periodically make little catchup cods to sort
    of like you know I'm tracking this and as it moves over my eye lags behind so
    I'll jump ahead to get on top of it you can kind of see that happening here as
    I'm again coming around this corner because I want to shoot this mean Ninja um
    here's that same pattern again double checking and then I don't need to watch
    the whole thing necessarily but uh so again so this is this is like this is behavior
    this is a a task that I performed a visual motor task that I performed at this
    point several years ago um actually I don't even know when that was 20 some 20
    something that doesn't start with a two uh and the the the sort of the nature
    of the data gives us this really interesting insight into the kind of the cognitive
    task that was being performed um you can see this was something I I had this sort
    of like vague intuition this intention to like do this for different characters

    is what that looks like again my head is not actually moving so it's not the same
    behavior but it is sort of related I am turning in this case but it's kind of
    like my eye is attaching to a particular part of the world and then sort of Shifting
    around there and so I'll let this play out because it's only a couple more minutes
    and I'll just talk over it um but part of the I think like I I I I like approaching
    the question of how Vision Works from this perspective of looking at it how it's
    actually used in real life or not real life but sort of simulated real life is
    an act I was alive I did I did do that um but in that that approach is um very
    sorry it's hard not to look at it um but the concept of of looking at the going
    to shad my post-doctoral adviser who taught me how to use an ey tracker and also
    came up with the idea sort of her her main her name is Mary heho and her main
    focus is kind of on uh task Dynamics and how the uh so Mary is you know been around
    for a while I think she's in her 70s at this point possibly late '70s um and she
    kind of was one of the first people to really start trying to study natural behavior
    um and people moving we won um I think uh right and so notice now too is like
    now that I'm not now that I'm not engaged so Mary studied natural behavior still
    does um and when she started studying it in like you know ' 80s uh she had a lot
    of people telling her that it's not possible like you just you cannot study natural
    behavior it's too noisy it's not controlled the data you're going to get get the
    data you're going to get is going to be some messy nonsense and there's not going
    to be any way to interpret it um because at the time still still now but doubly
    so back then uh the standard mode of educ of of research was highly controlled

    and doing very very simple experiments of like look to the left if the thing is
    blue look to the right if the thing is red so the idea that Mary was going to
    try to study people who were less constrained was met with derision um because
    the idea was that you're not you're never going to be able to get anything meaningful
    out of data like this that's behavior is too complex and so Mary's idea was to
    focus on the task Dynamics um which is to basically rather than focusing on the
    the biological system on its own think about it in the context of what is the
    task that this organism is trying to actually compete um and what are the things
    that define success and failure on that task and if we think about things in that
    context then the data all of a sudden starts to make a lot more sense like if
    I if I didn't know that the health bar was the health bar was down here and the
    cool Downs are down here this weird shape that keep showing up would just be a
    weird shape that keep showing up but because I know the task I can sort of interpret
    what that is and then if we wanted to we could sort of look at how that corresponds
    to different sort of this stats and the others um and also start asking questions
    about like like the speed at which these sods happens H can sort of you know like
    oh all like the fastest sads are only at this 150 millisecond rate it's like oh
    well there's people doing the proper Neuroscience that tell us that but you know
    that if it's moving that fast then that means that the it's more important to
    get information from multiple places than it is to get really good information
    from one place um and I wanted to show this thing at the end here so now here
    that I'm actually not really engaged in a particular task my eye movements are
    way more all over the place they're far less stereotyped don't see the same shape
    showing up and if you wanted to you could definitely come up with stories about
    what I'm looking at looking at but even here in the same exact task same ex same
    exact environment um you have to start making a bunch of different guesses about
    why I'm choosing to look one place versus the other because we we always have
    a task every time you're anywhere you have a task that you're performing um but
    if the task is not like difficult in time constrained um you're not going to be
    able to really interpret why I think so it's like you know I like looking at people
    like looking at faces and I'm looking at his hands people like looking at faces
    and hands um looking at the rest of the kit and body and whatnot and now it's
    kind of like looking looking here and so there's a lot of research that kind of
    tries to interpret data like this of just watching complicated tasks and watching
    videos and watching people do things um and this is kind of like your pupilometry

    I'm trying to do in time warse let's try to yeah okay so task Dynamics and the
    study of Neuroscience natural Behavior Mary heho all good terms to look up um
    and yeah so now let's look so looking at how the the so there's there's kind of
    these two sides to the question one is like how is the physiological system of
    of vision used in natural tasks and the other is what is the actual structure
    of that thing and how do these two sort of How does the structure of the visual
    system play into to the usage of it in the real world and vice versa um and I
    think that's probably why I often tend to struggle with like ordering in this
    class it's like these are all chicken and egg questions like there is no real
    linear progression that I think makes sense and I think that talking about the
    physiology absent of the behavior is sort of just as lost as the other way around
    so um looking so let's think about eyeballs uh should I draw this draw a little
    bit I I'll get a picture before I draw it why are you going so slow oh it's cuz
    come on man oh wait yeah so uh open Imes new tab so that's an eyeball that's the
    side view cutout of the the thing we've been looking at from the front um and
    the most important thing that you'll notice when you look at human eye tracking
    data is that we point our eyes at things uh and we move them a lot and we point
    the the center little cross we tend to put on the thing that we care the most
    about um where's this line I'm not sure what that line is but this line here so
    this is called the phobia centralis your phobia is a very important part of your
    visual system when you point your eyes at something you're pointing this at that
    thing it is a area of extremely high high density of visual

  text: '[Music] phobia yeah so your phobia phobia means pit and is basically a place
    where we''ve moved the goop out of way so that we have a better view of the actual
    photo receptors at the eye um I mentioned one point that your eyes are backwards
    um which is true um rods and cones so we''ve heard of rods and cones these are
    the things that are sort of uh let me do this let''s let''s Zoom back out here
    okay so you got your eyeball you got your pupil and light comes into the pupil
    and it''sit the back of your eye um and so the rods and cones are basically like
    your rods are basically little sticks the cones are a little bit pointier and
    in inside of them they have um a bunch of things but the most important one okay
    I got to turn this off I was still running that other thing so the options in
    your eye are the chemicals that actually respond to the light and they they look
    like the hexagons your standard standard hexagon with like a sort of long tail
    coming off of it and you have different types of opsins that respond to different
    types of light when a photon comes and hits it uh the opson uh changes shape and
    so one of the sections become what if it kyru or whatever um and sort of changes
    shape and it gets us kink in it actually think I did this backwards I think it
    starts with a kink and it straightens out when it absorbs a light but the idea
    is that the the energy of the photon of the light induces this change in the physical
    structure the physical chemical chemical structure of the opson and that changes
    its charge and so that charge is what sort of becomes the neurochemical Cascade
    that uh Sor the the the the Cascade of neural firings that sort of leads to your
    perception of'

  text: light um this is a weird process there's many options there sort of you have
    short medium and long uh cones that resp that correspond roughly to red blue and
    green um your rods are don't have the three colors but they only respond to Green
    um and it's your your night vision is your rods and there's a pereni shift that
    happens when they're trading off from each it's a whole thing um but the so basically
    it's this the the lumpy part of the rods and the cones that actually house those
    opsin in this sort of peaky part here and so you might if you were a reasonable
    person assume that we would want to point that part the photosensitive part towards
    where the light comes from um but that is not actually how our eyes are set up
    um the photo receptors are actually pointing back and then the the wiring that
    comes off of it uh goes back out through and so when the light is coming in um
    it has to pass through the the aons of the neurons attached to the RADS and CS
    rods and cones before it can actually be absorbed um by the by the actual opsins
    in in your eye um and so that is why the phobia so basically every part of your
    visual system is worse than it could be um because the light that you were trying
    to focus has to pass through all of these neuron bodies the of the the the these
    middle layers that have gangling cells stuff like that there's a whole whole lot
    going on there the light has to pass through that before it can get to the actual
    photosensitive area and so the fobia we push that goop to the side so that there's
    an unobstructed path of the that the light can get through the idea of why this
    stuff is that way is it's not to be related to when we crawled out of the ocean
    and our eyes kind of had to we had to carry some water along with us so we could
    focus the light better and something in that process inverted things I don't really
    understand that but uh uh cephalopods like squids and octopuses and cuttlefish
    their I face it's it's faced the right way like their their photo receptors face
    towards the source of light um there's another sort of troubling aspect of this
    which is that if all of the wiring coming off of the back of your photo receptors
    is sort of goes back onto the top of your retina this the thing on the back with
    the photo seis is called the retina at some point

  text: it has to punch back through in order to become the optic nerve that actually
    takes the data the neural the we call it data who cares the pattern of neural
    activity associated with the light in the environment has to punch back through
    your retina in order to get back to the the rest of your nervous system so that
    means that there is a blind spot on your retina um where you don't have vision
    and you can find it so if you close your left eye and then look at your um so
    close your left so right eye open look at a your thumb at arms length and then
    with your other hand with your thumb up put it like this and then move your thumb
    to where your knuckle is and it maintain your fixation on that thumb so watch
    me so I'm looking at the thumb and I'm I never stop looking at the thumb I line
    up my thumb here and then I move my thumb to where my knuckle was and if you do
    it right your thumb will disappear okay yeah it's it takes a little practice but
    for me so if I'm looking at this thumb my thumb is not visible to me right here
    it's just a empty empty Block in space um so that's another way to do it is just
    hold your thumbs together um so look at pick your pick the left one so with your
    right eye um focus on this one and then slowly move the other one out while maintaining
    fixation on that thumb and it should disappear anyone getting it yeah it just
    sort of like evaporates it's hard it's hard to maintain fixation on the thing
    without looking over and also your brain fills in the Gap so you kind of have
    to notice that it isn't there uh when you're done here just just look up like
    a blind spot demo and there's some other stuff that will show you there um but
    it's sort of just one of these main it's like a classic thing to show of this
    like blind spot where you don't get visual information but you get information
    from all around it and so but because we have two blind spots and they're not
    over the same area we we can fill in the gaps and there's interesting research
    on like if you give people patterns in the blind spot how will the brain fill
    in the pattern like it because it tends to um and yeah uh so should here's just
    another example of that so this chunky BET right here is your optic nerve and
    that's the part that goes from your that takes so you're when you're looking at

    um this is roughly speaking your uh field of view for for I think this is per
    I um in this Central zone right here it's actually not going to be visible here
    so this is 30 20 10 probably 5 so probably right around this circle here that's
    roughly speaking your phobia um you also have your fola which is like a smaller
    area within that space um and then sort of others Z so we have pretty wide vision
    I mean you know I can see my hands out to here and if I Wile my finger so you
    can just like interesting games you can play with yourself just kind of like move
    your hands until you can't see them and then wiggle your fingers and then you
    can see them because we are more sensitive to Motion in the periphery um and also
    notice that it's not this is not a circle it's not a ISO like the central part
    is circular but the whole field of view is laterally oriented because we live
    in a world that is tends to be laterally oriented um and so our sensitivity is
    sort of it's not arranged in a sort of circle around our phobia um it is horizontally
    distributed U we are also Vision oriented Predators so we have a different field
    of view than if we were um you rodents or equines like goats have the rectangular
    eyes mice have the eyes that point out to the side um all these cases of like
    the Ecology of how the animal uses Vision in its ecological niche uh shapes the
    way that the information that the visual system is set up and as I said before
    I think I'm not sure if I said it today but it's it Bears repeating that fobia
    is again roughly the size of your thumbnail at arms length um it takes up roughly
    1% of your visual field roughly 50% of your visual cortex is devoted to processing
    the information from that small spot there um so that is that concept is called
    cortical magnification um and it's kind of why I feel somewhat com comfortable
    um with these representations that as a as I said like I this circle is roughly
    the size of the phobia um plus or minus one visual degree um and I think representations
    like this overemphasize that fobal perspective because we are getting information
    from the whole thing from the whole field of view um but it is nonetheless I think
    it's valuable to look at the location of that sort of directed visual Focus because
    that is basically an indication of this is the part of the visual field that my

    not so much those decisions are not particularly uh costly but as the task becomes

    um critical uh show this briefly then I'll what we doing on time I won't show

    at the patterns of path on the ground when you're choosing footholds walking over
    rough Terrain in that kind of context you only have about you know 400 milliseconds

    can support your whole body or you'll fall into a river and break your leg um
    so that the sort of yeah the niess that there is a aspect where you can um you
    can get basically a readout of that cognitive question of where in the environment
    do I want information from um because we are highly fiated IM ey Focus uh Predators
    we have this nice feature where we can point a camera at the eyeballs do some
    old school computer vision um to get the pupil Center here and then get a measure
    both of where the eyes are pointing not not only where the eyes are pointing but
    where in the environment did my central nervous system want to get information
    about to complete whatever task it is I'm doing um yeah so I think I can draw
    fast enough for this the internet is already drawn all the pictures I could care
    about um optic kaym stop it with the AI so so so you got your eyeballs and you
    got the optic nerves that come in and there's this part in the middle here where

    and stuff like that that um and it was later his work was later rediscovered um
    by good old Des cartez um and translate one of dayarts so dayart you know of cartisian
    coordinates Fame one of his main things was he was a polyglot he spoke a ton of

    written in Arabic and translate them into Latin and then once it's Latin all the
    Europeans are like wow day cart you're so smart um so this is the model of the
    eye you can sort of see it's got Vitus humor cornea this was the um so uh the
    lens so IAM got everything basically right but he didn't understand how the lens
    worked um so he just had some comment in this thing that there's some probably
    some Demon that lives in there and bends the light cuz back back in the day when
    you didn't know what something how something worked you just said the little demon
    does that part like the rest of it I can do math about um but that part there's

    right hemisphere I don't know why this is my text stack is struggling um and so
    so like there's lateralization in the brain so like your right hand is controlled
    by your left hemisphere for some for some reason um and so sort of a naive view
    might be to think that it's just like the same for your eyes like your left eye
    connects to your right hemisphere um but it is not actually how that works uh
    because your left hemisphere so your visual cortex is here in the back um and
    your left hemisphere handles the right visual field not the right eye so if I
    want to know about the things that are over here um I don't necessarily want to
    know about what's going on in this eye but as they project let's pretend I move
    my eyes um they're going to project on so from the right side it's going to project
    onto the left side of each eyeball and so we need right so this is the right I'm
    super dyslexic so this is hard uh so the right the projections from the right
    visual field need to make it to the left visual cortex so these ones can go straight
    back and these ones have to cross over and so then if you want to know about stuff
    going on from the left visual field gu I got to figure out how this stupid thing
    works come on so this is the so this is an object in my left visual field um and
    that's projecting onto the right side of each eye so that is the left it has to
    get to the right hemisphere so these ones can go straight back and this one can
    cross over and that's this crossing over point there that's called that's the
    optic kaym um the kaym is actually the The Crossing part but the yeah so this
    is the this is how those literal wiring like the literal likey back in the 7th
    century was just cutting open heads and looking at where the the the the optic

    and then these little guys right here are the um is that Thalamus um I think that
    is a Thalamus which is kind of like a way station all your senses go through the
    thalamus except for smell uh because smell is chemo sensation sensation of chemicals
    in the environment the the story is that that's that is the oldest sense that
    like bacteria have smell because they're detecting chemical gradients and so that
    is the only one that doesn't go through the whatever the thalamus stuff um but
    anyways it goes through here this there's we stuff that happens here like motion
    s sensitivity stuff can happen there the whole thing of you're more sensitive
    to this or that there's also some tracks that sort of now but so these ones are
    going to going going back to the visual cortex proper which is the thing that
    lives on the back of your brain and then this is where you also get actually some
    of these tracks don't go to your cortex I don't think some of some of them don't
    even go to the thalamus some of them go like straight into the spine and straight
    into like they bypass cortex and give you things like the startle response that
    happen where visual information makes you move and do like ah stuff like that
    a lot of like balance stuff has subcortical Pathways that bypass the brain and
    just go straight down to the spine um oh this is a good image this what I was
    looking for um oh lateral geniculate body my bad um but yeah so this is this is
    what you will generally see as the visual path but there are subcortical Pathways
    that bypass all of the the big pink wrinkly bit on top um oh yeah you also have
    a blind spot because you have a nose like there's just a part of your visual feel
    that just like never really has anything going on um so that's kind of I find
    funny um yeah uh subcortical pathways are interesting um and what else do I want
    to show here I'm kind of trying to checkbox some things here just because the
    main thing to sort of to remember here is the this concept of visual field kind
    of quadrants sort of or or not quadrants necess but like just the idea that you're
    the retina and the visual Fields have kind of a complic ated relationship that
    is sort of there a lot of mirroring that happens where you see the picture of
    like now the the tree is upside down

  text: because of how lenses work so you can see like the lower visual field here
    is on the top down there um so there's this sort of spatial correspondence between
    um there's a bunch of different angles going on here one is the anatomical structure
    of the eye itself the other is like the visual field relative to your body I guess
    so like if I'm sitting here moving my eyes around like my visual field kind of
    moves with my eyes but my visual environment does not so there's sort of complicated
    playoff there um and that structure is kind of maintained as it gets back into
    back through this the the the good oldfashioned just physics and Optics and into
    the weird goopy electric meatloaf um that spatial structure of the visual environment
    is sort of maintained um in these kind of weird like split apart and stuff like
    that so that by the time you get back to the V1 visual cortex visual CeX uh what
    was I look for cortical expansion what am I looking for here um am I not finding
    this picture I feel like I'm being let down by people who put pictures from Neuroscience
    books on what am I missing here feel like why am I not being able to find this

  text: retinotopic that's retinotopy that's the term I was looking for sorry retinotopy
    that's the term I was looking for and not able to find um so the the concept the
    main concept that to think about here is that there is a retinotopic map um kind
    of similar to the cartoon of the motor the sensory motor culous the horrible guy
    that lives in your motor cortex who has giant hands and giant mouth because that's
    where we have our most sensitivity in terms of sensation and movement um there
    is also a kind of map in your visual cortex that corresponds to your visual field
    and they're sort of the the cartoons that we draw about it look a lot like this
    and similar to the horrible man that lives in your head um horrible person that
    lives in your head and sort of is the sort of the cartoon monster that represents
    your Sentry motor sensitiv this is also not it's like we love this story it's
    a great story it's in every textbook um and it's true to a certain extent but
    the the data looks more goopy than that like it's not this like perfect beautiful
    map it's like it's it's more of of this type of thing oh was that know this person
    um and so if you uh so this representation of the brain by the way the the black
    spots are the are the pits and then the white spots are the tops so you basically
    take the brain and like expand it out that's what this represents um and so this
    is stimulating in the visual field and having this not particular not my favorite
    color map um you can see that there is kind of a a a striation that happens there
    where there is that different parts tend to correspond to different parts of the
    visual field um but it is complicated um uh this is a very famous image I think
    it may have won a Nobel Prize I'm not quite sure but this is showing the um Superior
    calculus of a monkey and they yeah retinotopic organization and what they did
    is they were they were they were stimulating in the monkeys so Superior calculus
    handles eye movements um and they stimulated like little electrical signals to
    the to the cortex and generated eye movements that sort of mapped that pattern
    so also in the same way that there's like both the sensory cortex and the motor
    cortex and they're kind of paired to each other uh the visual perception system
    and the ocular motor movement system are also kind of paired through these retinotopic
    Maps um because if I have you know if there's if I'm looking here and there's
    something in the periphery that I want

  text: to see this retinotopic location sort of you know I'm I'm fixating here but
    there's some bright little shiny thing that shows up in the upper right that is
    also the coordinates that I need to know to make an eye movement to fixate on
    that thing so there's this there's a linked map that I've been talking about V1
    which is that's the stuff in the back of the brain um that's your perceptual system
    that is not your ocula motor system that ocul motor system is more spread out
    and weird um we're going to talk more about that during next class we talk about
    um we're going to briefly talk about it in the evolution chat um well here's a
    nice sort of different animals have different sort of shaped visual fields and
    stuff like that um but yeah so um so yeah so there's kind of a a general sort
    of like a complicated relationship between the physiology of the eye in terms
    of the optical characteristics of how the light bends and all that kind of stuff
    um the physiology of the retina which is the part of your visual the part of your
    eye that actually responds to like that's the part where you have neurons in your
    eye like there's an argument that you're that your eyeballs should be considered
    a part of your censor your central nervous system because even though we think
    of them as kind of peripheral they're they do computation on the retinal gangan
    cells um so there is processing that happens like in these the middle layer so
    if you want to know that's like the term there so in the in the retina you have
    the photo receptors you have the optic nerve and then you have these like middle
    layers you have there's like something like 60 some different cell types in the
    middle layers some of them are connecting uh the neuron the the photo receptors
    to the the the optic nerve bodies some of them are connecting to each other some
    of them have long short middle term distances um recently was discovered that
    some of these middle layer cells are sensitive to light um specifically blue light
    and they're thought to be related to our circadian rhythms um but there's yeah
    and then retinol gangan cells retinol gangan gangan cells um yeah so horizontal
    cells which connect them to each other and so the the there

  text: is like processing that happens on here and it has to do with a number of
    different sort of like like it it's it's a little mysterious about what all is
    actually happening in there but you it leads to a lot of uh famous Illusions shman
    grid Illusions uh which for some of y'all with Mac computers will have this in
    directly available so stuff like this which you may have seen before open image
    in new tab so each one of these circles is white but as you are looking at one
    of them the periphery will be dark um Herman grid uh famous illusion that illusion
    is happening at the level of your retina because of lateral inhibition and sort
    of in the periphery the the black of the square kind of overlaps with the white
    so there suppression that happens but only in the periphery because when you're
    fixating on it your phobia is small enough to have enough resolution there but
    bunch of weird little Illusions happening there so so yeah 110 I think I think
    I'll probably leave that brain dump there that's probably enough to enough to
    chew on um and enough sort of relevant relevant terms there so you got uh the
    task Dynamics thing in terms of the actual usage you have the the physiology of
    the eye you have this concept of lateralization and um the optic kaym and the
    the the retinotopic mapping between your visual fields and your your uh your visual
    cortex um got the middle layers going on in the strange cacophony of your retina
    you have the blind spot um you have all the you neurons there um and yeah you
    have the ocular motor system and in particular if you want to know more about
    that Superior culus uh which handles the um oculo oculo motor retino topy yes
    yeah and so like the that relationship between like the retinotopic aspects of
    your perceptual system and then the retinotopic aspects of your ocul motor system
    and sort of how those things play together um and none of that has anything to
    do with movement um I guess IM movements have stuff to do with movement and often
    times people will talk about eye movements as body movements um and they technically
    are but the question of sort of how this information actually makes it into your
    body and actually allows you know like how does the information

  text: get from your visual system down to whatever system is handling like throws
    and catches and stuff like that um we can it has to do with your prial Lo probably
    prial cortex also has to do with a bunch of subcortical Pathways um and also your
    the cortical spinal tract which I realiz I I said wrong about that I said like
    only humans have it it's not true a lot of animals have it it's just that we have
    it's to greater or lesser extent um so like quadrip PEDs in particular like cats
    and dogs have a very minimal one and more complex not complex but animals that
    use their for lims more tend to have more um and uh something else going to say
    there um and it has to do with sensation it's a it's apparently a direct mapping
    from your motor cortex cortico spinal tract so it's a direct mapping from your
    motor cortex down to your spine so you can have like a very short uh synaptic
    Loop between the sensory information that you get from your body and your motor
    commands that sort of respond quickly to things that don't have to Route all the
    way through the weird complex wetwear because that's a very slow route like things
    that go through the cortex take about 200ish milliseconds to really like get all
    the the way through and this is that this is the visual representation of how
    that thing mentioned mentioned before okay um all right I'm going to stop there
    um and let's do what has now become somewhat stereotype behavior of 2024 D1 D
    no not- 1105 visual neuroscience and um yeah in the 10 minutes we have left uh
    please just do the thing we've been doing of just pop in there and uh just ask
    the bot about the stuff that I've been saying I said a lot of stuff on a lot of
    different many different layers of uh sort of cl cl Clarity um so but you can
    kind of see how this game is going now like it's it's this is less about trying
    to get specific high quality text written in there and more an opportunity for
    me to filter the stuff that I've been saying through your individual nervous system
    so I can get a sense of where people's interests are and um also as we have learned
    it tends to gum up when it gets slammed like this so just give it a second to
    catch up um and let's do that for 10 minutes I've noticed that some of yall are
    not all the chats come from class time which I appreciate uh so feel free to go
    and yeah dump dump data into the machine as
