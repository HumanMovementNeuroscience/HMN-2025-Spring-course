# HMN25: Research Methodology

## Summary
Research methodology in human perceptual motor neuroscience encompasses the systematic approaches and techniques used to collect, analyze, and interpret data related to human movement and perception. This theme highlights the importance of empirical data collection, the subjective nature of research, and the application of various methodologies to enhance understanding in the field. Key points include:

- The significance of individual perspectives in data interpretation.
- The role of technology, such as eye tracking and photogrammetry, in research.
- The necessity of careful experimental design to address challenges in data collection.
