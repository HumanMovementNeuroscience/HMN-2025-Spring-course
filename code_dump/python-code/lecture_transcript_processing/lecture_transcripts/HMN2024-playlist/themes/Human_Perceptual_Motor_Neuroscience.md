# HMN25: Human Perceptual Motor Neuroscience

**Summary:**
Human perceptual motor neuroscience explores the intricate relationship between perception, motor control, and the underlying neural mechanisms that facilitate movement and interaction with the environment. This field encompasses various aspects of human physiology, balance, eye tracking, and the neuro motor hierarchy, providing insights into how individuals navigate and respond to their surroundings.

**Highlights:**
- Understanding the interplay between perception and motor control.
- The significance of balance and center of mass in human movement.
- The role of eye tracking in studying visual attention and cognitive processes.
- The neuro motor hierarchy and its impact on coordinated movement.
