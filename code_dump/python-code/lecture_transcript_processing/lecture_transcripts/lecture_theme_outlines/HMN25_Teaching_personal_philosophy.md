# HMN25: Teaching/personal philosophy

## Abstract
The theme of "Teaching/personal philosophy" in the HMN25 course is centered around the professor's approach to education, emphasizing student engagement, personalized learning, and the integration of technology. The philosophy is rooted in fostering curiosity, encouraging exploration, and supporting individual academic journeys. Key highlights include:

- **Student-Centered Learning**: Encouragement of personal exploration and engagement with individual interests.
- **Integration of AI**: Use of AI tools to provide personalized support and flexible learning structures.
- **Philosophical Foundations**: Emphasis on understanding complex systems and emergent properties.
- **Empirical and Skeptical Approach**: Encouragement of skepticism and empirical measurement in scientific inquiry.
- **Communication and Presentation**: Importance of effective communication in scientific presentations and poster creation.

## Comprehensive Outline

### Introduction to Teaching Philosophy
- **Student Engagement**: 
  - Encouragement for students to engage with their interests and curiosities in human perceptual motor neuroscience.
  - Emphasis on personal exploration and the uniqueness of each student's academic journey.
  - Exposure to new concepts without the requirement of complete understanding.

- **AI in Education**:
  - AI-mediated tools assist students in navigating complex scientific language.
  - Personalized support through AI, contrasting with traditional professor-defined structures.
  - AI tracks student interests, providing a more flexible and personalized learning approach.

### Philosophical Foundations
- **Human-Centered Neuroscience**:
  - Focus on topics relevant to individual interests rather than a comprehensive list of important field topics.
  - Encouragement for students to absorb information and ask questions about intriguing topics.

- **Reductionism and Emergent Properties**:
  - Introduction of reductionism as a philosophical approach to breaking down complex systems.
  - Limitations of reductionism in understanding emergent properties that arise from larger-scale interactions.
  - Example of traffic illustrating the need to understand collective behavior rather than individual components.

### Discovery and Engagement in Teaching
- **Diverse Conversations**:
  - Gratification in diverse conversations arising from student engagement with material through AI.
  - Exploration of different topics of interest by each student, leading to rich discussions.

- **Research Focus**:
  - Emphasis on human behavior in natural environments rather than isolated laboratory studies.
  - Connection of behavioral observations with underlying biological mechanisms.

### Empirical and Skeptical Approach
- **Scientific Method and Empirical Research**:
  - Teaching the nature of science and the process of generating knowledge.
  - Importance of specificity and clarity in empirical research.
  - Skepticism as a basis for scientific reality, examining and justifying beliefs.

- **Empirical Measurement and Knowledge**:
  - Foundation of empirical measurement for making predictions and building tools.
  - Knowledge generation as relative, building on existing knowledge and experiences.

### Communication and Presentation
- **Scientific Posters and Presentation**:
  - Importance of understanding poster structure and content for effective communication.
  - Emphasis on distilling research essence into key findings for poster presentations.
  - Encouragement to avoid overwhelming viewers with text and focus on visual aids.

- **Effective Presentation Strategies**:
  - Conveying study essence within a short time frame, highlighting key points.
  - Avoiding verbatim reading of posters, providing high-level overviews instead.
  - Preparing for predictable audience questions and including visual representations of methods.

### Conclusion
The teaching and personal philosophy in HMN25 is characterized by a student-centered approach, integration of AI, and a focus on empirical and skeptical inquiry. The course emphasizes the importance of effective communication and presentation in scientific research, encouraging students to engage deeply with their interests and develop a robust understanding of human perceptual motor neuroscience.
