# HMN25: Biomechanics, posture, and balance

## Abstract
The theme of "Biomechanics, posture, and balance" in the HMN25 course explores the intricate relationship between the mechanical aspects of human movement and the neural control systems that maintain posture and balance. This theme delves into the principles of biomechanics, the role of the nervous system in motor control, and the methodologies used to study human movement. Key highlights include:

- The application of Newtonian physics to understand body movement and balance.
- The concept of the center of mass and its significance in maintaining stability.
- The role of the spinal cord and central pattern generators in locomotion and balance.
- The use of motion capture technology to analyze human movement and posture.
