# Poster Proposal #1: Topic Selection and Paper Identification

## Background
- This is the first step in the semester-long poster presentation assignment, which is the major project for the course. The purpose is to explore a topic within the realm of neural control of human movement that interests you. You'll identify a single representative paper in this area to help frame your research and presentation.

## Learning Objectives
- Identify a topic area of personal interest related to the course themes.
- Develop skills in researching academic literature.
- Gain experience in using research tools like PubMed, Google Scholar, and Zotero.
- Learn to format citations in APA 7th edition.

## Step-by-Step Guide
1. Choose a general topic area within the course's scope that interests you.
2. Search for a paper using databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, or other academic resources.
3. Select a paper that represents the type of research in your chosen area.
4. Import the paper into Zotero for citation management.
5. Provide a citation for the selected paper in APA 7th edition format.

## NOTES:
- You're not getting married here, you will have plenty of opportunites to alter and adjust your chosen topic before the poster presentation itself!

### Question 1

What is the topic you want your poster presentation to focus on? Is it a particular domain of inquiry? A particular methodology or technology? A particular application or societal problem?

What draws you to this area? What do you find interesting about it, and what do you want to know more about?

There are no wrong answers here, this question is to help you learn how to identify and navigate your own interests, so that you can choose a topic that is the best fit for YOU

### Question 2
Provide a citation (in APA 7th format) of a research article that represents the kind of research that you find interesting about this topic area.

Ideally, this paper should represent the kind of research that you could see yourself conducting someday (whether or not you actually want to be a researcher later in your life, just daydream about the kind of thing that you would be interested in if you did)

For reference, an APA 7th citation looks like this:

Matthis, J. S., Yates, J. L., & Hayhoe, M. M. (2018). Gaze and the Control of Foot Placement When Walking in Natural Terrain. Current Biology, 28(8), 1224-1233.e5. https://doi.org/10.1016 j.cub.2018.03.008

##NOTES -
- Choose a relatively recent paper, i.e. something within the past 10-20 years
- Your paper should a primary research article, not a review paper (if you aren't sure if your paper is a review article, dump the abstract into the a bot /chat and ask it to help)
