    "page_summary": "# Overview of Human Perceptuomotor Neuroscience\n\n- **Assignment Instructions**: Students are required to select a singular empirical research paper for their semester project, avoiding review articles. A bot-mediated conversation will assist in paper selection and understanding methodologies.\n- **Philosophical Approaches**: The lecture discusses reductionism, which breaks down complex systems into smaller parts for study, and holism, which looks at systems as a whole to understand emergent properties.\n- **Perception-Action Cycle**: This cycle involves the conversion of environmental energy into neural activity and back into motor actions. It starts with sensory input, such as light entering the eye, and ends with motor output, like moving a hand to touch an object.\n- **Visual Processing**: Light is transduced into neural signals in the retina, processed in the visual cortex, and interpreted as objects. The brain's visual processing involves multiple stages, from detecting edges to recognizing objects.\n- **Motor Cortex and Movement**: The motor cortex, along with the cerebellum and spinal cord, plans and executes movements. The cerebellum, with its high neuron count, plays a crucial role in motor control and coordination.\n- **Spinal Cord and Central Nervous System**: The spinal cord is part of the central nervous system, handling reflexes and basic movement patterns. It works in conjunction with the brain to process sensory input and generate motor output.\n- **Muscles and Movement Mechanics**: Muscles act as variable stiffness springs, converting neural commands into mechanical energy to move the body. The interaction between neural activity and muscle mechanics is a key focus of neuromechanics.\n- **Eye Movements and Visual Perception**: Eye movements are controlled by the oculomotor system and are crucial for visual perception. Eye tracking is used to study where and how the brain seeks visual information.\n- **Research Methods**: Motion capture and eye tracking are primary methods used to study human movement and perception. These tools provide data on body configuration and eye movements, offering insights into perceptual-motor processes.\n- **Educational Philosophy**: The lecture emphasizes personalized learning and the use of AI tools to tailor education to individual interests, encouraging students to explore topics that resonate with them.",
    "paragraph_summary": "The lecture provides an overview of human perceptuomotor neuroscience, focusing on the perception-action cycle, visual processing, and motor control. It discusses philosophical approaches like reductionism and holism, emphasizing the importance of understanding both the parts and the whole of complex systems. The lecture also covers the role of the cerebellum, spinal cord, and muscles in movement, as well as the significance of eye movements in visual perception. Research methods such as motion capture and eye tracking are highlighted as tools for studying these processes.

    "timestamped_utterances": "00:00 we&amp;#39;re recording now um so to repeat that\n00:04 um the the proper assignment like the\n00:07 the proper proper like poster proposal\n00:09 assignment will be on uh like a one or\n00:13 two sentence right up on the topic area\n00:15 that you&amp;#39;re going to want your poster to\n00:17 be on and a singular citation of a paper\n00:21 that kind of represents what that\n00:24 research what what what that like\n00:27 research in the area that you&amp;#39;re going\n00:28 to be presenting on um um the standard\n00:31 assignment for 22.99 is that you&amp;#39;re\n00:33 supposed to pick a singular paper for\n00:35 the whole semester and then your poster\n00:37 is going to be you presenting just that\n00:39 paper um I think we can go a little bit\n00:42 beyond that if that&amp;#39;s all you want to do\n00:44 that&amp;#39;s totally valid um but I think we\n00:46 can do a little bit more broad of a of\n00:48 an overview um\n00:51 and uh but to keep us kind of honest\n00:54 we&amp;#39;re just I&amp;#39;m going to ask you to to\n00:56 pick a singular paper and then the the\n00:59 bot me mediated conversation will be\n01:02 sort of designed to help you do that so\n01:05 if you you know give it say here&amp;#39;s the\n01:07 topic I want to study um here&amp;#39;s a paper\n01:09 I&amp;#39;m thinking about here&amp;#39;s the abstract\n01:11 um I&amp;#39;ll prompt I&amp;#39;ll make the bot\n01:13 prompted to kind of like ask you the\n01:14 kind of questions um that you know I\n01:17 would ask you if I have the time and\n01:19 energy to kind of sit down and talk\n01:21 about it um behind the curtain when they\n01:24 talk about this class uh the most of\n01:29 what they tell us to do is try to help\n01:31 you guys not pick a review article for\n01:34 your paper and to pick an actual proper\n01:37 like Empirical research article like\n01:39 because it&amp;#39;s really it&amp;#39;s like like if\n01:42 you just go search for papers on a given\n01:44 topic you&amp;#39;re going to find review\n01:45 articles at the top of that list and\n01:46 it&amp;#39;s not always super obvious whether\n01:49 you&amp;#39;re looking at a review article or a\n01:50 book chaper or like an empirical study\n01:54 um so I can tell the bot to help you\n01:57 with that uh and it&amp;#39;ll do things like\n01:59 asking you about the methodologies and\n02:01 topics and stuff like that so just kind\n02:03 of like helping you kind of like parse\n02:05 the very very dense language that an\n02:07 abstract or scientific papers typically\n02:08 written in um and so then there will be\n02:10 some like sort of like simple check boxy\n02:12 style of canvas assignment and then like\n02:15 a Discord server based conversation\n02:18 space there um and those will be\n02:21 ostensibly um do um next week so end of\n02:27 next week meaning 11:59\n02:30 p.m. on Sunday before the following\n02:33 Monday and if you don&amp;#39;t hit that\n02:34 deadline there will be dire\n02:36 consequences um not really but it&amp;#39;s sort\n02:40 of we wanted to keep kind of in that\n02:43 General Cadence that the that we&amp;#39;re all\n02:45 kind of like on the same path\n02:50 um\n02:51 and\n02:53 probably probably by the end of this\n02:56 next week is when the I will have\n03:00 implemented the stuff where the bot will\n03:01 be kind of like keeping track of a\n03:03 profile of your interests and trying to\n03:04 like help in the journey that you will\n03:07 take through this General field\n03:12 um but we&amp;#39;ll see anytime I make a\n03:15 promise about the future just know\n03:17 internally I am\n03:21 screaming\n03:27 um great\n03:37 okay off up okay who cares\n03:47 um yes\n03:50 okay let&amp;#39;s go ahead and get into\n03:54 it\n03:56 um I know what to do\n04:00 methods I realized I forgot um Mo\n04:05 cap tracking\n04:09 Etc\n04:20 okay I also forgot a piece of equipment\n04:23 that I intended to bring today uh so I\n04:25 will use this instead\n04:33 someone doesn&amp;#39;t know how\n04:36 to great that\n04:39 works all\n04:48 righty\n04:50 okay so let us begin the lecture proper\n04:57 um so\n04:59 it&amp;#39;s been nice for the first part of\n05:01 this class kind of seeing you guys\n05:03 talking about your interest in the\n05:06 server you know kind of talking to the\n05:07 bot about what you&amp;#39;re into and what you\n05:09 want to study and things like that um\n05:13 and I I intentionally wanted to have\n05:16 that part happen first before I kind of\n05:18 talk about my own talk too much about my\n05:20 own\n05:21 particular sort of map of this space um\n05:25 because I I didn&amp;#39;t want\n05:27 to uh\n05:30 I wanted to let you guys kind of like\n05:32 think about it for yourselves before I\n05:34 came up and did like the like the\n05:36 traditional Professor thing which is to\n05:38 tell you here&amp;#39;s what this field is and\n05:39 here&amp;#39;s what this means and here&amp;#39;s what\n05:41 the here&amp;#39;s what is on topic here&amp;#39;s what\n05:43 is off topic um because I generally\n05:45 don&amp;#39;t think that that&amp;#39;s how we should\n05:48 think about intellectual inquiry um and\n05:53 the next chunk of time I&amp;#39;m going to give\n05:56 you an overview of this domain of human\n06:01 centered Neuroscience um that is mostly\n06:04 related to my own particular history my\n06:07 own research background my own the\n06:10 studies that I&amp;#39;ve done um and anytime\n06:13 that you you know by the time that you\n06:15 have sort of lived long enough to have\n06:17 Specialties and personal experiences and\n06:20 whatnot you will have sort of charted\n06:22 your own path and trajectory Into the\n06:24 Heart of some field or some domain um\n06:28 and for pretty much all of you you know\n06:30 for everyone that sort of chooses to\n06:32 follow a route kind of like that um you\n06:35 are going to have a sort of unique path\n06:38 like everybody&amp;#39;s path is going to be\n06:39 different and everybody&amp;#39;s sort of the\n06:42 the the topics that are relevant to\n06:44 everybody&amp;#39;s interest will all will be\n06:46 will be different um\n06:49 so I don&amp;#39;t want to present this stuff in\n06:52 the sense that in a sense of saying here\n06:55 is everything that matters here is\n06:56 everything that is relevant to this\n06:58 topic um I I really want to keep it kind\n07:01 of on that like relatively personalized\n07:05 Narrative of these are the topics that\n07:08 are the most important for me to be able\n07:11 to study human human perceptual motor\n07:14 Neuroscience in the ways that I\n07:16 specifically have learned how to do\n07:19 um and sort of talking about that in\n07:22 that Con in that context of like the the\n07:26 the component pieces of my particular\n07:28 specialty um and I think the beauty of\n07:30 using sort of AI mediated Tools in a\n07:35 classroom setting is that in a\n07:37 traditional class the professor kind of\n07:40 like lays out the curriculum lays out\n07:42 the structure lays out the topic area\n07:44 and then you are all kind of constrained\n07:46 to follow that structure um and that&amp;#39;s\n07:49 largely for practical reasons like it&amp;#39;s\n07:51 just it&amp;#39;s just too hard and it requires\n07:53 too much human labor to like really\n07:55 mediate and like sort of navigate the\n07:58 particular um sort of variations of\n08:01 interest of people in a room even even a\n08:04 room that is labeled under a particular\n08:05 course title um but I think with the AI\n08:09 you know limited though it may be it\n08:12 will always do a do its damnedest to\n08:15 sort of make whatever your interests are\n08:18 relevant to the topics that I have\n08:22 mandated it should care about um so as I\n08:25 start going through this stuff uh just\n08:30 encouraging you to really learn to key\n08:33 in to like your own personal feelings of\n08:37 interest in your own personal feelings\n08:38 of like being drawn or snagged or moved\n08:43 by some topic or some domain um and you\n08:48 know if you want to follow the\n08:49 trajectories that I&amp;#39;m doing that&amp;#39;s all\n08:52 well and good but even if you wanted to\n08:54 you wouldn&amp;#39;t it wouldn&amp;#39;t happen that way\n08:56 because that&amp;#39;s not how the world Works\n08:58 um and so as I give this sort of lecture\n09:03 um my main request for you is to just\n09:07 not let your brain turn all the way off\n09:09 I&amp;#39;m going to be talking fast about a lot\n09:11 of sort of topics that are going to be\n09:13 relatively unfamiliar um for some of\n09:15 them they might be the first time you&amp;#39;ve\n09:17 heard about it for some of them you\n09:18 might have heard about it before uh the\n09:21 goal is not to have you understand\n09:23 everything that I&amp;#39;m saying the goal is\n09:25 to just expose you to it um so as I\n09:28 start sort of blah blah bling at you\n09:32 um don&amp;#39;t get too hung up on whether or\n09:35 not you&amp;#39;re following everything just\n09:36 kind of like remember the words as much\n09:38 as you can try to let just try to let it\n09:40 wash over you I promise you nonzero of\n09:44 it will be attaching um and then when we\n09:48 kind of open things back up\n09:50 uh you can start asking the bot asking\n09:54 your neighbors the questions about the\n09:55 parts that were the most interesting to\n09:57 you and the part that I have found the\n10:00 most gratifying about doing this type of\n10:02 a class is the Discovery every time\n10:04 empirically that when I give a lecture\n10:07 on a given topic and then I say to 40\n10:11 students ask the bot about the parts you\n10:13 found most interesting typically what I\n10:15 see from that is 40 different\n10:18 conversations about 40 different topics\n10:20 and that&amp;#39;s really a lot of fun\n10:24 um\n10:25 so with that said let us get get into it\n10:30 um unfortunately\n10:34 I I\n10:36 brought I intended to bring a um like a\n10:39 tablet so I could like draw like stuff\n10:43 with colors um and I brought the tablet\n10:45 but then when I looked for like the the\n10:47 pen part I found I just thrown like this\n10:51 like standard pencil into here which I\n10:53 can&amp;#39;t even I can&amp;#39;t even imagine what was\n10:56 going on when I did that so we&amp;#39;re just\n10:59 doing we&amp;#39;re going to do it old school\n11:01 with unfortunately just a singular color\n11:02 but that&amp;#39;s\n11:04 okay\n11:06 um let&amp;#39;s see move over\n11:12 here\n11:16 so was your\n11:20 fault how dare you okay I&amp;#39;ll just I&amp;#39;ll\n11:24 put it on your bill\n11:28 um um\n11:31 um okay\n11:35 so right so the topic of the course is\n11:38 neuroscience the the department is\n11:39 biology and most of you as biology\n11:42 majors and whatnot have internalized to\n11:47 some degree or another with validity\n11:50 that biology and Neuroscience are things\n11:52 are is is Rel is related to things like\n11:54 cells and neurons and wet lab microscope\n12:00 types of conversations and stuff like\n12:02 that super valid super good topics good\n12:05 things to look at um and all kind of\n12:10 part and parcel with a particular\n12:12 philosophical tradition that is so\n12:15 fundamental to the way that we do\n12:17 scientific research in\n12:20 2025 in Earth um that we often don&amp;#39;t\n12:25 even think about it and that is the\n12:26 concept of reductionism that&amp;#39;s not your\n12:28 way\n12:30 um so reductionism is just sort of a\n12:32 general philosophical approach to the\n12:35 study of the natural world um which\n12:37 tries to break things down into smaller\n12:41 and smaller pieces so that with you can\n12:43 sort of make more and more precise\n12:44 measurements and more more precise\n12:46 topics more more precise investigations\n12:48 but this kind of like sort of like\n12:50 implicit assumption that at some point\n12:53 there will be that by looking at the\n12:54 component pieces of the world you&amp;#39;ll be\n12:57 able to get a sense of the istic view of\n13:00 how everything works um and there&amp;#39;s a\n13:03 lot of validity to that approach but\n13:04 there&amp;#39;s also obviously a lot of\n13:06 limitations to that um because if you&amp;#39;re\n13:08 only looking at the small pieces in\n13:10 isolation you never going to see or\n13:13 you&amp;#39;re going to have a hard time seeing\n13:15 what we call emergent properties which\n13:17 are things that only really come about\n13:19 when you look at the the combination of\n13:21 things at a larger scale than the kind\n13:24 of things you can put into a test tube\n13:26 and under a microscope um the classic\n13:29 example of emergence is traffic um so\n13:32 traffic is a property of cars on a road\n13:36 um but you can never understand traffic\n13:37 by looking at a singular car it&amp;#39;s\n13:39 something that only really comes about\n13:41 when you&amp;#39;re looking at the cars\n13:42 operating in\n13:43 their natural environment\n13:47 um and so you know the the counter to\n13:52 reductionism is what you might call more\n13:55 holism or something like that um\n13:59 but that tends to be the scale that my\n14:04 sort of research domain tends to operate\n14:06 in is I I tend not to be like I look at\n14:09 the research of the people who are doing\n14:11 the highly reduced sort of like\n14:13 electrophysiology studies where they put\n14:15 electrodes into the brains of various\n14:17 animals um fmri where they have people\n14:19 in a tube and they&amp;#39;re looking at the\n14:21 magnetic resonance of their hemoglobin\n14:23 in their brain um but my particular\n14:27 domain of research tends to focus on\n14:29 humans behaving in natural environments\n14:33 doing um the kinds of stuff that we do\n14:36 in our sort of day-to-day lives so you\n14:38 know like throwing things in the air and\n14:40 catching them involves there&amp;#39;s a motor\n14:42 behavior of putting Force into the\n14:44 marker an information gathering phase\n14:48 and then another motor command which if\n14:50 it lines up with the\n14:51 world works out if it doesn&amp;#39;t I drop it\n14:55 um\n14:57 and large sort of trying to understand\n15:01 that behavioral process um in its\n15:05 natural context and then trying to use\n15:08 whatever the best measurements that I\n15:10 can come up with um of those behaviors\n15:13 and then trying to attach them to sort\n15:15 of the more low-level reductionist sort\n15:17 of um fields of inquiry so that we can\n15:21 have a sense of like you know how the\n15:23 things like cells and neurons can lead\n15:26 to complex behaviors like that so I\n15:30 think of it as kind of like it&amp;#39;s almost\n15:31 like a robotics approach so it&amp;#39;s I like\n15:33 to tell people that I studi the part of\n15:35 Neuroscience that overlaps with robotics\n15:38 um because robotics is another field\n15:41 that kind of like keeps you honest in\n15:43 the sense that it&amp;#39;s you make things that\n15:45 move around in the real world so you\n15:47 can&amp;#39;t really cut that many corners so\n15:48 the thing just stops working um and the\n15:52 difference is that the like robots we\n15:56 know how they work because we made them\n15:58 but we they can&amp;#39;t do all the things we\n16:00 want humans we don&amp;#39;t really know how\n16:02 they work but they can do pretty much\n16:03 anything so there&amp;#39;s this kind of\n16:05 combination of those two sort of\n16:07 thinking about the human as like a\n16:09 magical meat robot and trying to study\n16:11 it and understand it from the that\n16:14 perspective um can lead to a lot of\n16:17 useful results um and the nice thing\n16:21 about that is kind of the abstraction\n16:24 away from the biology and from the the\n16:28 the knowledge that it is in fact under\n16:30 the hood cells and neurons and you know\n16:33 membrane potentials and things like that\n16:35 um and thinking about it more in the\n16:37 terms of the things that we can measure\n16:39 um which we will talk about shortly\n16:43 um so let&amp;#39;s\n16:47 talk so speaking of the natural world\n16:50 let&amp;#39;s sort of talk about something\n16:53 which you know is one of the ways to\n16:56 parse out that General topic which is\n16:58 what&amp;#39;s called the perception Action\n17:00 Cycle um\n17:07 so let&amp;#39;s start by drawing a brain I&amp;#39;m\n17:12 trying to draw\n17:14 it I&amp;#39;m\n17:19 draw yes let&amp;#39;s do it like that um so\n17:22 here&amp;#39;s how you draw a\n17:25 brain there you go\n17:32 um\n17:35 the sorry try and you&amp;#39;ll figure it out\n17:40 okay so this is your brain this is a\n17:43 picture of your brain that&amp;#39;s your\n17:45 temporal lobe this is your eye you&amp;#39;re\n17:47 facing that way\n17:51 um and there&amp;#39;s a lot of details that are\n17:54 not being covered here but this is the\n17:55 general shape so here you are that&amp;#39;s\n17:59 your that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s you and you existence\n18:03 in the\n18:04 world\n18:06 and let&amp;#39;s\n18:14 see let&amp;#39;s do this different\n18:22 way there you go that&amp;#39;s you you&amp;#39;re in\n18:26 the world and here here&amp;#39;s your\n18:30 body here&amp;#39;s your eye here&amp;#39;s your mouth\n18:32 and then inside of there that&amp;#39;s your\n18:35 brain not to scale and\n18:40 so as you are in the world you have a\n18:44 very limited awareness\n18:46 of of your given context and the\n18:51 everything that that you know comes in\n18:54 through your senses and well your senses\n18:56 in your memory so let&amp;#39;s think about a\n18:58 particular moment in time where you&amp;#39;re\n19:00 sitting here you have your eye and then\n19:03 you see out\n19:08 here there&amp;#39;s a\n19:10 cat you like cats and so you so the\n19:13 image so light from the sun bounces off\n19:16 the cat and goes into your eye and we&amp;#39;ll\n19:21 talk a lot about eyes we&amp;#39;ll talk about\n19:23 the lens we&amp;#39;ll talk about the retina\n19:25 we&amp;#39;ll talk about the phobia we&amp;#39;ll talk\n19:28 about the optic nerve um but the most\n19:31 the main thing is that\n19:34 their your eye is the place where\n19:36 environmental energy is first absorbed\n19:39 by your nervous system and this\n19:43 moment right here is a very special\n19:46 moment in your perceptual cycle which is\n19:49 the moment of\n19:50 transduction um which is the term for\n19:53 the moment when some form of\n19:56 environmental energy in this case light\n19:59 has gets transduced and converted into\n20:03 neural activity in this particular case\n20:06 in\n20:07 your this is your eye the light goes in\n20:12 it\n20:12 goes into your\n20:14 retina into your phobia which talk\n20:17 plenty about um there&amp;#39;s a\n20:22 particular\n20:24 uh class\n20:26 of molecule called opsin opsins look\n20:30 roughly like this this like you know um\n20:34 what are they called carbons and\n20:35 hydrogens and then the hexagon and then\n20:38 the long the long uh sort of Wiggly tail\n20:41 um the people in Biochemistry this is\n20:44 probably familiar shapes except this is\n20:46 not drawn well and then you have a bunch\n20:48 of these opsins in your eye um and\n20:52 they&amp;#39;re all there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s basically\n20:54 three main ones and they&amp;#39;re sort of\n20:55 they&amp;#39;re all they they&amp;#39;re tuned if you\n20:58 want to use that term to different\n21:00 wavelengths of light and they the nature\n21:02 of them is that when a photon of light\n21:05 hits them they absorb the energy of that\n21:08 Photon and then change shape and I think\n21:11 I actually did this backwards I think\n21:13 they start out with the Kink and then\n21:15 when they absorb the light they\n21:16 straighten out um but whatever happens\n21:19 this absorption of a photon changes the\n21:23 electrochemical properties of the\n21:27 molecule and it goes from being a\n21:30 neutral to a plus one or a minus one or\n21:32 whatever it is um but the point is that\n21:35 the the the light that is coming from\n21:37 the environment bouncing off the cat\n21:40 entering your eye changing the chemical\n21:42 layout of the opson um and happening in\n21:46 the trillions and billions of sort of\n21:48 instances that biology tends to operate\n21:50 in um this changes the polarity and the\n21:56 Electrical uh state\n21:59 of the rods and the cones in your retina\n22:02 which get sort of you know accumulated\n22:04 with ganglia and various sort of other\n22:07 stuff\n22:09 um and leads to a shift in the uh\n22:13 electrical potential in the in that\n22:15 section of your retina that then gets\n22:17 sent in as spikes down your optic nerves\n22:21 neurons are the things that Neuroscience\n22:24 is made of and mostly what neurons do is\n22:27 they Spike they send little electrical\n22:29 pulses and that&amp;#39;s how they communicate\n22:31 that whatever that neuron has tuned to\n22:33 has has occurred um and for a for a for\n22:38 perception for vision it&amp;#39;s this\n22:40 absorption of light into the opson and\n22:43 the and the shift in this polarity and\n22:46 then the change in that electrical state\n22:48 that leads to a change in the\n22:53 um what&amp;#39;s the term\n22:56 uh the spike rate of of a given gangan\n23:00 cell as it is sending its axon down the\n23:04 optic nerve into your um\n23:09 optic the occipital lobe and the the\n23:11 visual cortex\n23:14 um and so we&amp;#39;re going to talk more about\n23:17 this in more detail and more coherence\n23:20 um but the important thing here is that\n23:23 the light that has been absorbed by your\n23:25 eye that is then gets converted through\n23:28 this strange biochemical machine into a\n23:32 pattern of neural\n23:33 activity uh because the neural activity\n23:37 is caused by the light and because the\n23:39 light has been reflected off the object\n23:41 in question there is a general belief\n23:44 and assumption um that that the pattern\n23:48 of neural activity has somehow has some\n23:52 relationship with the object in the real\n23:54 world there&amp;#39;s some statistical\n23:56 correlation there&amp;#39;s some relationship\n23:58 and the pattern of neural activity\n24:00 somehow encodes information about the\n24:03 world that you&amp;#39;re looking at um the\n24:07 nature of that relationship is tenuous\n24:10 and complex um and generally speaking\n24:14 extremely impoverished like the actual\n24:16 information we&amp;#39;re getting in any mo One\n24:17 Moment In Time is far less than you\n24:20 think it would be it&amp;#39;s a lot but the\n24:23 richness of your visual environment for\n24:25 example is very much an illusion based\n24:28 off of your brain&amp;#39;s ability to sort of\n24:30 Cobble together a lot of noisy\n24:32 information to give you something that&amp;#39;s\n24:34 sort of accurate enough to move through\n24:36 the world but often in almost\n24:39 exclusively designed sort of like after\n24:41 the fact um\n24:49 so that&amp;#39;s your brain again um it&amp;#39;s more\n24:52 like a ma brain but that&amp;#39;s fine so your\n24:55 optic so the light comes into your eye\n24:57 gets absorbed by the retina which is on\n24:59 the back of your eye sends a pattern of\n25:01 neural activity down your optic nerve um\n25:05 passes through some subcortical areas\n25:07 and the thalamus and stuff like that\n25:09 which we&amp;#39;ll talk not that much about\n25:11 that part but there is some stuff that\n25:12 happens here um and then projects down\n25:16 to the occipital lobe which is otherwise\n25:18 known as the visual cortex which is in\n25:21 the back of your brain\n25:24 um not super important to know where it\n25:27 is but it&amp;#39;s just just kind of like one\n25:29 of those things like it&amp;#39;s like Vision\n25:31 happens here for in the back for\n25:35 whatever reason\n25:39 um and so this is the place\n25:42 where the first kind of like the first\n25:46 pass of information about your visual\n25:48 environment sort of starts to get\n25:50 computed and it&amp;#39;s mostly in the form of\n25:52 like edges and dark patches light\n25:55 patches you know and stuff like that and\n25:59 once you get from V1 which is primary\n26:02 visual cortex it goes through other\n26:05 stages of processing that lead to sort\n26:10 of more and more\n26:11 complex you know um structures to emerge\n26:15 so like you start with things like edges\n26:19 and then if you have enough edges you\n26:21 can get patches and if you get patches\n26:23 then you can get textures and if you get\n26:25 textures you can get objects and\n26:29 that sort of like each stage of visual\n26:32 processing Builds on the stage before um\n26:35 to sort of eventually lead to the\n26:37 ability to do things like object\n26:39 recognition of like oh that thing out\n26:40 there is a cat there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a\n26:42 conversation we can have about like like\n26:45 the the parts of that process that go\n26:48 down this lobe which is your temporal\n26:50 lobe which is here um tends to be the\n26:54 sort of object space of like that&amp;#39;s a\n26:56 desk that&amp;#39;s a computer um and then the\n27:00 part that we tend to care more about in\n27:03 this class is the part that goes up this\n27:07 direction um which tends to be more in\n27:09 tune of using that information to plan\n27:12 your movement out in the world\n27:16 um something that I haven&amp;#39;t said I think\n27:18 yet but probably but is something that\n27:20 bear is repeating is obviously this is a\n27:23 cartoon this is a very abstracted\n27:27 simplified version of a story which if\n27:30 you wanted to tell the whole story you\n27:32 would have to tell a thousand thousand\n27:34 stories of a thousand thousand humans in\n27:36 their Labs recording data getting a\n27:38 bunch of numbers and then making up\n27:41 their own stories and the discussion\n27:42 sections of their own papers about what\n27:45 the different parts mean and then this\n27:47 kind of cartoonified story is the\n27:50 version that tends to make it into the\n27:52 textbooks that we T sort of communicate\n27:54 back to you and sort of try to make\n27:56 sense out of any of it\n27:59 but I think it&amp;#39;s really important that\n28:01 we remember that this is not the real\n28:03 story this is the cartoon and the real\n28:06 story is something that we don&amp;#39;t\n28:08 actually have access to there is no\n28:12 there&amp;#39;s no level like of of class where\n28:16 I can just give you the book that says\n28:18 here is what the visual cortex is\n28:20 actually doing the best I could ever do\n28:22 is just to give you a record of all the\n28:24 empirical measurements that all the\n28:25 humans who have ever investigated this\n28:27 man to put together and then tell you\n28:29 the story that we have collectively\n28:31 decided is the best story that we can\n28:34 come up with for how we think this part\n28:36 of this lumpy pink thing inside of all\n28:39 of our skulls is\n28:40 operating\n28:43 um but yeah but that&amp;#39;s\n28:48 not there is a gap an essential gap\n28:51 between epistemology which is our\n28:54 knowledge of things and metaphysics\n28:57 which is what actually exists uh and the\n29:00 two things never truly touch there is\n29:03 always going to be a difference between\n29:04 knowing something and what that thing\n29:07 actually is and in the history of\n29:10 science we have told many many many\n29:12 stories about what we think is going on\n29:15 in the world and in our bodies and in\n29:16 our goopy bits um and historically over\n29:21 time every single one of those stories\n29:23 on a long enough time scale is proven\n29:25 wrong in some sense everything we\n29:27 currently think think will eventually be\n29:29 proven wrong in some way or another um\n29:32 evidence for that being everything we&amp;#39;ve\n29:34 ever thought up until this point has\n29:35 been proven wrong in some way or another\n29:38 um so as you think there&amp;#39;s something\n29:40 special about today that&amp;#39;s going to keep\n29:42 happening um indefinitely until the sun\n29:45 burns out but the beauty of the\n29:47 scientific process in some sense is that\n29:50 we have this belief that even though\n29:53 everything has been wrong there is a\n29:55 sense that each success of idea is less\n29:58 wrong than the one before it and less\n30:01 wrong means that it allows us to make\n30:03 more precise predictions it allows us to\n30:06 heal sickness better it allows us to\n30:08 build machines that do more exciting\n30:11 things um sometimes those improvements\n30:14 happen by completely throwing around\n30:16 throwing out philosophical sort of like\n30:19 base level beliefs about how certain\n30:20 things work um but yeah it&amp;#39;s a\n30:24 continuous process we&amp;#39;ll talk about it\n30:31 um yes\n30:35 so so here we are in this\n30:37 cycle you the light has bounced off the\n30:40 cat it&amp;#39;s hit your eye it&amp;#39;s been absorbed\n30:42 it&amp;#39;s been transmitted back to your\n30:45 visual cortex um you have identified\n30:49 that it&amp;#39;s a cat and you have a an\n30:52 inbuilt volition that says I like to\n30:55 touch cats great we support this for you\n31:02 so this is the parietal lobe don&amp;#39;t worry\n31:04 about the parietal lobe it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s great\n31:07 but you can worry about it if you want\n31:10 um but the important sort\n31:17 of okay\n31:19 so this back here is your visual cortex\n31:23 um this on the side here roughly\n31:26 speaking is your motor cortex\n31:31 and So eventually you start as you as\n31:34 you look in more and more pictures of\n31:35 the brain you will and you can look at\n31:37 this directly the the the wrinkles and\n31:39 stuff on the brain are not random they\n31:41 are conserved in the same sense that\n31:45 while every face that we have looks very\n31:48 different they generally have two eyes\n31:50 and a nose and a mouth and just in\n31:51 different kind of configurations the\n31:53 wrinkly stuff and the the crevices and\n31:56 bumps and stuff on her brain roughly the\n31:58 same like if you were to crack open all\n31:59 the brains in this room which I don&amp;#39;t\n32:01 recommend um you would find a lot of\n32:04 Correspondence in where the the big um\n32:07 creases and stuff come in um and I am\n32:11 not at the level of that anatomy where I\n32:14 can name them off the top of my head um\n32:17 but I do recognize them in pictures and\n32:19 that&amp;#39;s how you can kind of it&amp;#39;s easy to\n32:22 tell when someone is drawing a brain\n32:24 artistically versus when they&amp;#39;re looking\n32:26 at Anatomy because\n32:29 artists and whatnot often just say oh\n32:30 yeah it&amp;#39;s a bunch of like pink wrinkles\n32:32 and then you just sort of it&amp;#39;s like okay\n32:33 well that&amp;#39;s not that&amp;#39;s not actually how\n32:35 we do but anyways there&amp;#39;s a big one\n32:37 right in the mirror called the central\n32:38 sulcus sulcus is like the crease part\n32:42 and on this side of that sulcus is the\n32:46 somato sensory cortex somat sensation is\n32:49 like basically touch like think that\n32:52 this type of sensation um and on that\n32:55 side is the motor cortex so the n\n32:58 sensory cortex and then the motor cortex\n33:00 and they tend to be paired\n33:03 and you can look up I&amp;#39;ll you we&amp;#39;ll look\n33:06 up the huny LI when we talk about the\n33:08 motor cortex\n33:13 um but I kind of it&amp;#39;s It&amp;#39;s I enjoy this\n33:17 distinction and kind of like there&amp;#39;s\n33:18 these two sides of the brain where on\n33:21 this side of the brain it&amp;#39;s kind of like\n33:23 sensation and sort of the the perception\n33:26 of the world like visual aspects and\n33:28 this the sort of sensory aspects and\n33:31 then on this side of the brain is where\n33:32 we start getting to like motor actions\n33:33 and movements and kind of the outgoing\n33:36 parts of things um and as we sort of\n33:38 keep going forward you eventually get\n33:40 over here to the frontal loes um the\n33:43 frontal lobe is like the big lumpy part\n33:45 in the front that&amp;#39;s the like the the the\n33:47 most human part of the brain all Maman\n33:51 brains are roughly the sort of same\n33:55 anatomically they&amp;#39;re just very fun\n33:58 mirrored into different sort of shapes\n33:59 and sizes like you know rats have a much\n34:02 more pronounced Factory bulb for smell\n34:05 versus their visual cortex and the human\n34:08 brain has a has a lot of extra Anatomy\n34:13 on that frontal lobe area this is\n34:15 thought to be kind of where decision\n34:16 making comes from this is where sort of\n34:18 like language kind of lives and often in\n34:21 it&amp;#39;s um referenced in\n34:24 uh like executive function so that the\n34:27 feeling of like deciding what you want\n34:30 to do this is also where like\n34:32 metacognition happens so if you&amp;#39;re\n34:33 having thoughts about your thoughts like\n34:35 oh yeah I&amp;#39;m angry right now like that&amp;#39;s\n34:37 a that&amp;#39;s a frontal loby area and and\n34:40 just reiterating the point every time I\n34:43 point to a part of the brain and I say\n34:45 this is the part that does this thing a\n34:47 little part of me inside is screaming\n34:51 and dying because none of this is how\n34:54 any of it that like that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the\n34:56 cartoon that&amp;#39;s not how the real world is\n34:58 set up it&amp;#39;s much more complex than that\n34:59 it&amp;#39;s much noisier than that but it&amp;#39;s if\n35:03 I say this is where executive function\n35:05 happens and I point at the front of the\n35:07 brain and then this is where Vision\n35:08 happens and I point at the back of the\n35:09 brain that statement is more true than\n35:12 if I switch those two things around so\n35:14 just it&amp;#39;s important to reiterate that\n35:17 even though I am telling you these\n35:18 simplified stories these sort of\n35:20 textbook level conversations about how\n35:21 the brain\n35:23 is this is the stuff that if we come\n35:26 back to this class in 250 years we&amp;#39;re\n35:28 going to be saying very very different\n35:30 things but we&amp;#39;ll probably still say\n35:31 something like the vision happens in the\n35:33 back and the cognition happens in the\n35:35 front anyways um from this frontal lobe\n35:39 from the you get sort of the frontal\n35:41 area executive functions then you get\n35:43 your\n35:44 premotor area and somewhere around here\n35:47 is where volitions arise volition is\n35:52 sort of same route as voluntary it&amp;#39;s\n35:55 like the things that you want to do so\n35:56 you see you see the the cat and you say\n35:58 I want to touch the cat here\n36:01 is the cat and look at me I&amp;#39;m touching\n36:05 it and that&amp;#39;s this is what I want to\n36:08 happen and\n36:10 so now you are in this state where\n36:13 here&amp;#39;s your body here here&amp;#39;s your hand\n36:16 there here&amp;#39;s this cat there and here&amp;#39;s\n36:19 this desire that I sure wish that my\n36:20 hand part was on this cat part um and\n36:24 this sort of and now there&amp;#39;s a a gap\n36:27 between\n36:28 the way that the world is in your\n36:29 perception and the way the world that\n36:31 wish the way that you wish the world\n36:32 would be which is that your hand was\n36:33 sort of touching this object okay so\n36:37 those volitions kind\n36:38 of meld\n36:41 with uh the perceptual\n36:45 experience and from this sort of alchemy\n36:50 emerges something resembling a motor\n36:52 plan\n36:54 um we&amp;#39;re going to I&amp;#39;m trying to stop\n36:56 myself from going to some of these\n36:58 details because I am going to have like\n37:00 like we&amp;#39;re going to have a whole lecture\n37:01 about the eye we&amp;#39;re going to have a\n37:02 whole lecture about the motor cortex\n37:03 we&amp;#39;re going to talk about this in more\n37:04 detail I&amp;#39;m just giving the overview\n37:10 uh but\n37:12 um but yeah but this is where we would\n37:14 call\n37:15 something the first time we start seeing\n37:17 something resembling a motor plan\n37:19 there&amp;#39;s a lot of times in the chats\n37:22 y&amp;#39;all have been having where you talk\n37:24 about things like muscle memory um which\n37:26 is the sort of muscle memory is kind of\n37:29 like the uh it&amp;#39;s a term we like to use\n37:32 it&amp;#39;s like a very standard human\n37:34 expression um but it&amp;#39;s also one of the\n37:36 things that like it doesn&amp;#39;t really exist\n37:39 in a physiological sense like your Mo\n37:41 your muscles don&amp;#39;t have memory they&amp;#39;re\n37:43 much simpler object which we will talk\n37:45 about muscles too um usually what you\n37:49 mean when you say muscle memory is motor\n37:51 plan um and as you sort of work on\n37:55 something more and more and you get more\n37:56 expertise more experience that&amp;#39;s the\n37:59 that that what we tend to refer to as\n38:01 motor as muscle memory is really like\n38:03 the motor plans kind of becoming more\n38:05 robust and more sort of locked in\n38:09 um and typically where a lot of that\n38:12 kind of motor planning takes place is\n38:14 not necessarily in the motor\n38:17 cortex um but most of that starts\n38:19 happening\n38:21 in subcortical regions um so if you\n38:25 think about a picture of the brain and\n38:26 you think about the that pink wrinkly\n38:28 thing in your skull that&amp;#39;s T tends to be\n38:31 what we think about that&amp;#39;s your cortex\n38:33 that&amp;#39;s the um\n38:36 neocortex it&amp;#39;s the part where most of\n38:38 the processing happens um which we&amp;#39;ll\n38:42 talk a little about what processing\n38:43 means in this context um but it is I\n38:49 like to I like to talk about this as\n38:51 like that is the it&amp;#39;s like that&amp;#39;s kind\n38:54 of like the the bloom of the rose on the\n38:56 rose bush like when you think about the\n38:59 nervous system and you&amp;#39;re looking at\n39:02 when you&amp;#39;re looking at a rose bush it\n39:04 makes a lot of sense that we tend to\n39:05 focus on the rose like the red thing\n39:08 with petals and that smells nice and we\n39:10 spend a lot of our time focusing on that\n39:12 part of the plant in for very good\n39:13 reason but if you really take a step\n39:15 back and look at it from a b botney\n39:17 point of view it&amp;#39;s mostly Bush and just\n39:20 a little bit of row and I think that&amp;#39;s\n39:24 it&amp;#39;s kind of the same with the way our\n39:26 cortex works\n39:28 um the majority of our central nervous\n39:31 system is not in that cortex it&amp;#39;s in the\n39:33 subcortical regions and among my\n39:37 favorite of those subcortical regions is\n39:39 the cerebellum which it look sort of\n39:41 sits at this looks kind of like this\n39:43 fist shaped thing that sits right below\n39:45 your cortex when you look up pictures of\n39:47 the brain online you&amp;#39;ll see the big pink\n39:49 wrinkly thing you see this kind of more\n39:50 dense sort of like grayish looking thing\n39:52 underneath it um that&amp;#39;s your cerebellum\n39:56 your cerebellum is a very complicated\n39:58 Beast um it contains about 3.5 times as\n40:05 many neurons as the rest of your central\n40:08 nervous system combined um and that\n40:11 number is sort of strangely conserved\n40:13 across different animals like all\n40:15 animals mammals particular just because\n40:17 I don&amp;#39;t know about the other guys um we\n40:20 all have cortex we all have cerebellum\n40:22 we have very different brain to body\n40:24 ratios and different sort of proportions\n40:26 there but in General however big your\n40:28 brain is whatever animal you are your\n40:30 cerebellum is has three and a half times\n40:33 as many neurons as the rest of your\n40:36 cortex\n40:38 um which is one of those things like I I\n40:42 always sort of come back to that it&amp;#39;s\n40:43 sort of like that just seems anytime you\n40:45 find a number in nature that&amp;#39;s conserved\n40:47 across a bunch of different stases it&amp;#39;s\n40:49 just kind of like that seems like an\n40:50 interesting thing I wish I knew more\n40:52 about it um so your\n40:55 cerebellum the part of the reason why\n40:57 has so many more like neurons by by\n40:59 count is that the neurons in associated\n41:01 with it are teensy teensy tiny they are\n41:04 you have granual cells and you have\n41:06 pingi cells\n41:09 um which I W I&amp;#39;m going to look up\n41:12 pictures this because\n41:16 ah uh\n41:18 Peri\n41:21 cells oh do I have internet here\n41:31 yeah yeah preni cells in your cerebellum\n41:37 are like one of the more beautiful parts\n41:42 of the nervous of your of your brain\n41:44 it&amp;#39;s kind of you have the cell body you\n41:47 have the axon and then these are all the\n41:50 synapses and all of there&amp;#39;s thousands\n41:53 upon thousands of them um this picture\n41:55 is famous this was actually taken by\n41:58 not picture but it&amp;#39;s um this is from\n42:00 pinji the guy who sort of like he he\n42:04 created was it oh sorry kahal uh says\n42:07 right there um Ramon kahal\n42:11 who yeah um was part of the sort of\n42:15 group\n42:17 that came up with the staining\n42:19 mechanisms that allowed us to sort of\n42:20 start looking at neurons in their\n42:22 isolation that happened in roughly 1909\n42:24 before that we didn&amp;#39;t really know what\n42:26 neurons were and didn&amp;#39;t know if they\n42:27 were just one big mass or if they were\n42:30 individualized pieces and there was like\n42:31 a big scientific and philosophical\n42:34 debate about are neur is is the brain\n42:36 all one big connected piece or did the\n42:39 like do the do the neurons touch or are\n42:41 they separated from each other and there\n42:45 was Ramon Cal who was arguing in the\n42:47 favor of the synapse Doctrine which said\n42:49 that there was a gap between them and\n42:50 then there I think it was GOI who was\n42:52 arguing in favor of their it&amp;#39;s all\n42:54 touching whatever that was called and\n42:57 then um GOI came up with like a silver\n43:01 nitrate staining process that allowed\n43:04 them to make images like this of looking\n43:06 at cells and\n43:09 ironically by making that staining\n43:11 process prove the Cal side of that\n43:15 argument correct and that they tend not\n43:17 to touch and then they both got both\n43:20 Ramon Cal and GOI got they shared a\n43:23 Nobel Prize but apparently they had such\n43:26 bad blood between them that they both\n43:27 spent their entire speech bashing the\n43:29 other guy um so there you go there you\n43:32 got that\n43:34 um but yeah so\n43:38 your so your cerebellum is consists of\n43:41 preni cells and then granu\n43:46 cells\n43:48 which in comparison look more like this\n43:53 they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re small and they don&amp;#39;t\n43:55 have these super long fibers that sort\n43:58 of go very long distances they&amp;#39;re much\n44:00 more localized they only connect to\n44:02 their immediate neighbors um and the\n44:05 majority of ner of of neurons in your\n44:08 nervous system are these granular cells\n44:10 that live in your cerebellum your\n44:13 cerebellum is a layered thing\n44:17 um like most parts of your brain it&amp;#39;s\n44:20 got kind of like\n44:23 um like the layers tend to operate phog\n44:27 gentically so that on the outside is the\n44:28 newest stuff on the inside is the older\n44:31 stuff um sellum has that structure we\n44:35 may talk about it I&amp;#39;m not sure uh we&amp;#39;ll\n44:37 see it&amp;#39;s one of those things like if\n44:38 enough people talk to the bot and ask\n44:40 about this then I might like I&amp;#39;ll be\n44:42 I&amp;#39;ll be trying to steer the lectures\n44:43 based off the interest of the class um\n44:47 but anyway we&amp;#39;re talking about cats um\n44:50 so light hit the cat hit your eye\n44:53 absorbed in your retina tweaked your\n44:56 opsins triggered a neural\n45:00 Cascade vibrated your visual cortex uh\n45:04 gave you the perception of a cat your\n45:06 volitional desire to touch the cat\n45:09 combined with the knowledge that there&amp;#39;s\n45:11 a cat in front of you and started\n45:14 creating a motor plan which sort of you\n45:16 know this is where the cartoon gets\n45:19 really cartoony because it&amp;#39;s\n45:21 like there&amp;#39;s a lot of controversy about\n45:23 like the different steps of this process\n45:25 but long story short something in the\n45:28 com combination of your motor cortex and\n45:30 your cerebellum which is your cerebellum\n45:32 is largely like a motor based thing like\n45:34 a movement it mostly deals with movement\n45:37 of your body um it&amp;#39;s thought to be\n45:39 related to like tool use um so this this\n45:43 thing that we humans can do where we\n45:45 pick up an object and kind of pretty\n45:47 quickly learn the physics of it um and\n45:51 using it as a tool that has certain sort\n45:53 of characteristics is thought to be like\n45:56 a neoc thing the Neo is the new part\n45:58 it&amp;#39;s on the outside it&amp;#39;s complicated um\n46:03 but there&amp;#39;s a level there&amp;#39;s a\n46:05 hierarchical nature of your motor system\n46:08 where at the at the higher levels where\n46:11 the top is pretty much like the frontal\n46:13 lobe the the the plans are much more\n46:16 abstract so it&amp;#39;s things like I&amp;#39;m thirsty\n46:20 um I want I wish I was drinking water\n46:23 right now uh and then in order for that\n46:27 high level volition to be turned into\n46:28 something that can actually sort of lead\n46:31 me to my goal there has to be this sort\n46:33 of like um pairing down of specificity\n46:37 from that very high level volition uh\n46:40 down to something which at some level is\n46:42 going to have to boil down to muscle fir\n46:45 rings to move my body through space and\n46:48 so as I say oh I wish I had water I see\n46:50 that there&amp;#39;s water over there and\n46:52 somehow that volition is converted into\n46:54 motor commands that move my legs so now\n46:57 my body is in a place that I can move my\n46:58 arm I know how this thing works so I\n47:00 open the\n47:02 thing and I get to drink water\n47:07 um and\n47:09 so that process tends to go you know\n47:13 from the motor cortex then you got the\n47:16 cerebellum then your cerebellum sort of\n47:20 has connections to your brain stem I say\n47:23 connections but they&amp;#39;re really kind of\n47:24 like they&amp;#39;re wrapped around each other\n47:26 um\n47:27 so you have your brain stem your medulla\n47:29 oblongata your ponds um that&amp;#39;s the part\n47:33 of your brain people talk about your\n47:34 Reptilian Brain that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that part\n47:37 that&amp;#39;s the part that handles things like\n47:40 is my heart beating am I breathing is my\n47:43 temperature within a livable range that\n47:46 tends to be hanging out and controlled\n47:48 at your brain stem um and your brain\n47:51 stem is the start of\n47:53 your spinal cord which is another good\n48:00 friend there we go there you\n48:05 go there you\n48:14 perfect nice still you good job\n48:20 um and so your spinal cord is a part of\n48:25 your central nervous system often times\n48:28 when we think about the spinal cord it&amp;#39;s\n48:30 often kind of it&amp;#39;s It&amp;#39;s given a bad W\n48:33 and we tend even when we look at\n48:34 pictures of like if you Google pictures\n48:36 of the central nervous system you&amp;#39;ll\n48:37 often see pictures that stop here and\n48:39 it&amp;#39;s just sort of like you know cortico\n48:42 centrism sort of just focused on that\n48:44 that rose on the bush and then less to\n48:47 say about you the cerebellum often gets\n48:50 in the picture but we often like cut off\n48:52 where the spine is um but your spine is\n48:55 just as much a part of your nervous\n48:57 system as the rest of it and the\n48:59 specifically the way that we&amp;#39;re going to\n49:00 Define central nervous system as opposed\n49:02 to peripheral nervous system is uh\n49:06 Loosely that the central nervous system\n49:09 is where processing happens um where\n49:12 processing is a very goopy term um that\n49:16 basically means like information is\n49:20 coming in being some sort of conversion\n49:23 is happening which we might call a\n49:25 computation if we wanted to use like a\n49:27 computer analogy\n49:30 um but it information comes in changes\n49:33 form in some way and then information\n49:35 goes out um\n49:39 and\n49:41 the and you&amp;#39;re and the the spine is\n49:45 doing that kind of of processing um at\n49:49 various levels which we will also talk\n49:50 about let me see how we are on time okay\n49:53 on time um\n49:56 but it&amp;#39;s in very find it kind of\n49:58 fascinating ways and there are some\n50:01 stories that we will talk about later in\n50:03 the semester of studies that we aren&amp;#39;t\n50:07 allowed to do anymore um on cats where\n50:10 you can sever the spine like like cut\n50:13 the spine so it no longer connects to\n50:16 the upper part of the brain um and the\n50:19 cat can still do things like walk um\n50:22 because the spine is is housing the the\n50:25 gray matter that that does that handles\n50:28 things like Central pattern generation\n50:30 and reflex responses um or something\n50:33 like a central pattern generator is a\n50:35 thing that handles like the basic\n50:37 rhythmic motion of my legs and the thing\n50:40 that says oh well one foot is going to\n50:42 be in stance and the other one&amp;#39;s going\n50:43 to be in swing and then they&amp;#39;re going to\n50:44 sort of swap off um and a lot of that\n50:47 processing is handled in the spine\n50:50 itself\n50:52 um your spine goes down your spinal cord\n50:57 ends actually around here like right\n50:59 below your thoracic spine I know right\n51:03 um and then the stuff below that is\n51:04 what&amp;#39;s called like the cotus aquinus\n51:07 which is like that&amp;#39;s where it does\n51:09 become more um extension Cordy like and\n51:12 you you start to lose the gray matter\n51:14 and you get the more just like the\n51:16 peripheral nerves that go out to your\n51:19 limbs\n51:22 um yeah the yeah so the peripheral so I\n51:27 also just want to just again make that\n51:28 point that that distinction between\n51:30 central nervous system and peripheral\n51:32 nervous system is the kind of thing that\n51:34 is often stated as like this is a hard\n51:36 delineation um but there&amp;#39;s a lot of gray\n51:40 area there one of the most classic gray\n51:42 areas is the retina um the retina has a\n51:46 lot of neurons on the back of it and\n51:48 there&amp;#39;s layers to it and it&amp;#39;s often\n51:51 described like we think about the retina\n51:54 like the eye sort of like the classical\n51:56 sensory organ um but there&amp;#39;s stuff\n51:59 happening on the back of the retina\n52:01 before anything even leaves on on that\n52:04 optic nerve pass to the brain that\n52:06 really could be considered to be\n52:08 computation um similarly your skin has a\n52:11 lot of connections in it that you know\n52:15 might be doing things that we might\n52:16 consider computation um that&amp;#39;s why like\n52:19 when you get hurt if you like rub rub\n52:21 the thing it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt as much\n52:23 because the ACT the activity of\n52:25 activating sensory organs around the\n52:27 damaged area suppresses the feeling\n52:30 coming from the damaged area and that is\n52:32 all happening at the level of your skin\n52:35 um so just again this this these these\n52:38 names and terms and whatnot this is not\n52:42 like nature is not\n52:44 design divided into pieces with\n52:47 departments and names that&amp;#39;s a thing\n52:49 that we humans did to Nature so that we\n52:52 could have any hope of making any sense\n52:53 of it but anytime we put a name or a\n52:56 label or or a category into nature we&amp;#39;re\n52:59 always going to be making concessions\n53:01 and sort of we&amp;#39;re drawing lines around\n53:03 areas because it allows us to have\n53:05 better conversations about those things\n53:07 but there&amp;#39;s always going to be gray\n53:08 areas and often times it&amp;#39;s those gray\n53:10 areas or the cracks that the that tend\n53:12 to lead us to abandon certain thoughts\n53:15 and go towards\n53:16 others\n53:19 um okay so speaking of the peripheral\n53:22 nervous\n53:24 system um\n53:28 so where I wish had colors\n53:36 uh there you\n53:46 go okay this is your arm that&amp;#39;s these\n53:50 are your bones and your\n53:52 bones are mostly what you are like if\n53:57 we&amp;#39;re thinking about it in terms of like\n53:59 the space that you inhabit like the\n54:01 shape that you are your general sort of\n54:03 ability to move through the world it&amp;#39;s\n54:05 mostly bones um and then all the goop\n54:08 that&amp;#39;s associated with that is sort of\n54:10 the details but the General cookie\n54:12 cutter shape of you as a as a creature\n54:15 is driven by these weird sticks and\n54:17 these weird sticks have weird things\n54:20 attached to them called\n54:23 muscles um\n54:30 and yeah and\n54:33 So eventually one of the things that\n54:36 happens when you thinking about the sort\n54:37 of like more holistic picture of the\n54:39 world and sort of\n54:42 the way that you live in it\n54:45 um\n54:47 is be if you&amp;#39;re in a lab if you&amp;#39;re if\n54:51 you&amp;#39;re living this reductionist life\n54:53 where you&amp;#39;re choosing a particular\n54:54 domain of inquiry um and you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re\n54:57 sort of simplifying and cutting out any\n54:59 extraneous factors that get in your way\n55:00 to to sort of zoom in as far as you can\n55:02 on that particular thing um you get to\n55:06 remove all the parts of the question\n55:08 that you don&amp;#39;t want to look at and so if\n55:10 you&amp;#39;re a neuroscientist you might have\n55:13 you might take the mouse or the rat or\n55:15 the fruit fly or whoever you want to\n55:16 look at into the lab and then just like\n55:19 remove all the parts that you that\n55:20 aren&amp;#39;t Neuroscience so that you can have\n55:22 a better picture of the neurons that you\n55:24 care about when you want to think about\n55:27 when you don&amp;#39;t have that capacity and\n55:29 you want to think about things more\n55:30 generally um you don&amp;#39;t have that um that\n55:33 luxury and so if you want to think about\n55:36 how humans move through the world um and\n55:39 even if you care mostly about the neural\n55:42 aspects of it even if you care mostly\n55:43 about the perceptual aspects of that you\n55:45 are sort of required by the nature of\n55:48 reality to consider things like bones\n55:51 and muscles even though those are not\n55:52 particularly neural objects um because\n55:56 when we move when when our all this\n55:59 weird neural FL flam is eventually going\n56:03 to have to transmit down into something\n56:04 that moves the body through the world\n56:07 and this is where we get to the kind of\n56:08 the robotics y conversation because um\n56:13 this is the part where the neural\n56:14 activity which has been originally\n56:17 transduced into this sensory experience\n56:19 of of vision um all of that sort of\n56:25 combination of things is eventually\n56:27 going to get boiled down here to\n56:29 something that sort of flips that coin\n56:32 around and now the neural activity is\n56:34 going to be converted into environmental\n56:36 energy in this case in the form of\n56:38 mechanical energy so it&amp;#39;s going to\n56:41 squeeze my muscle and my arm is going to\n56:42 move that muscle my arm is going to be\n56:44 move and this is now has there&amp;#39;s an\n56:48 there&amp;#39;s literal like energy in this\n56:51 movement specifically in the form of\n56:53 kinetic energy or you know you know if\n56:57 I&amp;#39;m pulling on a spring or something\n56:59 like that might be mechanical energy\n57:01 like potential energy kinetic energy\n57:02 spring energy that&amp;#39;s the stuff that we\n57:04 get from our muscles and so there&amp;#39;s\n57:06 that&amp;#39;s the whole perception action cycle\n57:08 is this conversion of environmental\n57:10 energy into perceptual neural activity\n57:14 down back into a motor\n57:17 action and so your\n57:19 muscles are\n57:21 weird objects um and a muscle is\n57:25 effectively a variable stiffness spring\n57:29 that&amp;#39;s pretty much what a muscle is\n57:31 muscles only pull your muscle can only\n57:35 pull on things muscles cannot push if\n57:38 when I when it looks like I&amp;#39;m pushing\n57:40 it&amp;#39;s because this muscle is pulling on\n57:42 the tip of that bone so that my arm goes\n57:45 that way and that that&amp;#39;s called\n57:47 extension and then if I want to squeeze\n57:49 this one then I send a motor command\n57:52 down there it fires the motor tendon\n57:55 Union GGI body\n57:58 organs and it says Hey surrounding\n58:01 muscle tissue contract and so this what\n58:05 was originally a fairly Wiggly Soft\n58:07 Spring gets electrified and becomes a\n58:10 rather stiff spring and pulls this joint\n58:13 up and this one there&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re paired\n58:17 there&amp;#39;s a\n58:18 flexion uh muscle group and then there&amp;#39;s\n58:21 the extension muscle group and those two\n58:23 things operate in conjunction to to move\n58:27 this degree of freedom and that type\n58:32 of so yeah and so\n58:37 that so the motor plan that comes down\n58:41 from the motor cortex and sort of\n58:42 through the cerebellum if you&amp;#39;re a fancy\n58:45 type of an animal like a human it goes\n58:47 through the corticos spinal tract which\n58:49 goes there is a sort of connection\n58:51 straight from your motor cortex down to\n58:53 your spine bypassing things like your\n58:55 cerebellum\n58:57 all animals have a cortical spinal tract\n58:59 but it&amp;#39;s really um but not to equal\n59:02 degree um and that&amp;#39;s one of the\n59:04 interesting distinctions in the animal\n59:05 kingdom is\n59:07 like this is a fun this is one of my\n59:09 favorite I actually use this question to\n59:11 test like AI models to see how it does\n59:14 at Neuroscience is asking about the\n59:18 cortical spinal tract and how it varies\n59:19 across the animal kingdom because that&amp;#39;s\n59:21 one of the places where the questions\n59:24 get really subtle um and so I can look\n59:27 at how it does at that answer to see\n59:29 like I&amp;#39;m looking at like a local model I\n59:30 can run on my computer like the small\n59:33 ones I I can watch it get the subtle\n59:35 Parts wrong when I ask it that kind of a\n59:37 question so but a lot of stuff I&amp;#39;ve been\n59:39 talking about about how like motor\n59:41 cortex motor commands go through like\n59:43 the cerebellum and the brain stem and\n59:44 stuff like that that is true um but\n59:47 there is also this cortico spinal tract\n59:49 anytime you see one of those big words\n59:51 with an o in the middle just replace the\n59:53 o with a slash so cortico spinal is C\n59:58 cortex SL\n60:00 spinal that just basically go straight\n60:02 from the cortex down to the spine\n60:04 bypassing all the subcortical\n60:06 regions um and it&amp;#39;s what allows us to be\n60:12 to control our individual degrees of\n60:14 freedom of our body directly um as\n60:18 opposed to doing things in like it&amp;#39;s\n60:20 more synergistic way which\n60:22 is way deeper than I want to talk about\n60:24 in this particular lecture cheing that\n60:26 clock it&amp;#39;s killing me um so yeah so here\n60:30 I am I&amp;#39;m so close I&amp;#39;m so ready to almost\n60:32 touch this cat um and I my motor my\n60:37 motor plan which has come down from on\n60:39 high down this sort of hierarchical\n60:42 structure of our motor system has uh\n60:46 taken my awareness of the world and my\n60:50 own body so the vision gives me\n60:53 information about remote parts of the\n60:55 world things I can not touch things that\n60:57 are outside of mine here&amp;#39;s a great word\n60:59 peripersonal space the per personal\n61:01 space is the area that I can touch with\n61:04 my hands um outside of that is a\n61:07 different part of the world that&amp;#39;s kind\n61:10 of happening in the parietal Lo one of\n61:12 my favorite studies is this\n61:14 like they got a monkey Myck monkey and\n61:18 they trained it to grab things on a desk\n61:23 um and then they gave gave it a a\n61:27 temporary lesion so they just like\n61:28 squirt something into the part of the\n61:30 brain that handles that peripersonal\n61:31 perception so that that part of the\n61:33 brain kind of goes offline um and you\n61:36 get what&amp;#39;s called cortical blindness so\n61:38 the monkey sort of loses its ability to\n61:40 to see things cartoon cartoon um in that\n61:43 per personal Zone then they took the\n61:46 monkeys and they train it to use a\n61:47 grabber arm like a little like like claw\n61:51 arm so it now its reach is now farther\n61:53 because it can use this arm and when\n61:55 they ask after they teach it how to use\n61:56 it and they sort of leion that per\n61:59 personal Zone the blind spot increases\n62:03 to include the region that could be\n62:04 reached with the Grabber in addition to\n62:07 the hand um\n62:10 so put that into your worldview and see\n62:13 how it fits\n62:15 um so anyways um here I am I see this\n62:20 cat and I have this awareness of my body\n62:23 a lot of this is sort of call kind of\n62:26 associate that with um proprioception um\n62:30 so like as my arm is out here it is uh\n62:34 putting force on my joints because of\n62:37 the weight of the arm and my body can\n62:39 encode and is aware of those forces and\n62:41 I can use that to kind of be aware of\n62:43 where my arm is I can also see my arm I\n62:45 also have a memory of lifting it up\n62:47 there&amp;#39;s a lot of ways that we know where\n62:48 our bodies are um but I know that it&amp;#39;s\n62:52 here and that if I can make this part\n62:54 move that way um then I&amp;#39;ll have I will\n62:57 have achieved\n62:59 my my my deepest desire of touching this\n63:02 cat\n63:03 um and so there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot of comp\n63:06 complicated stuff about the like we\n63:08 don&amp;#39;t move our body one joint at a time\n63:10 we move it in the sort of like barely\n63:15 sophisticated dance um and a lot of that\n63:18 the breakdown and how we sort of how we\n63:20 choose to to to break down a complex\n63:23 movement across the available joints in\n63:25 the context of the world that&amp;#39;s a a\n63:27 cerebellum thing again cartoons um but\n63:32 let&amp;#39;s pretend like it&amp;#39;s not and so I I\n63:35 relax what is it so I I relax the flexor\n63:41 I\n63:41 tighten the extensor and that puts a\n63:46 torque on this bone which moves my hand\n63:50 here and now I\n63:52 have the reward of cat\n63:57 Sensations under my hand and I have now\n64:00 achieved this this goal of\n64:03 mine\n64:06 um right and so now and now we have and\n64:09 that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the loop so that&amp;#39;s one\n64:12 path through that perception action Loop\n64:14 because now that the information has\n64:16 gone in been processed been sort of\n64:19 whatever and now that I have moved my\n64:21 body I have now changed the state of the\n64:23 world like my body is in the world so\n64:25 now as I&amp;#39;m perceiving the situation as\n64:27 it stands I&amp;#39;m perceiving something\n64:29 different and now I&amp;#39;m going to go back\n64:30 through that Loop and so of you know you\n64:32 perceive you act and then you take in\n64:35 the information and you kind of like\n64:37 that Loop is tends to be where you live\n64:39 your whole life\n64:42 um and\n64:43 so yeah and so this is kind of the\n64:46 cartoon overview of of the story as it\n64:49 as it holds um I will name some of the\n64:53 uh the fields associated with the things\n64:55 that we talked about\n65:00 um yeah uh generally speaking when we\n65:04 talk\n65:05 about well talking about like the\n65:07 physiology of the eyeball tends to be\n65:09 kind of like optology I guess um uh but\n65:13 that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s more like lens and pupil\n65:15 and like the the goopy Parts um once\n65:18 you&amp;#39;re talking about like the the neural\n65:21 the neural activity aspect of it we tend\n65:23 to call that like visual like visual\n65:26 Neuroscience perceptual\n65:28 Neuroscience because we are such Vision\n65:30 heavy animals as humans often when you\n65:33 hear perceptual we tend to mean visual\n65:37 um but strictly speaking it&amp;#39;s all like\n65:40 anything sensory is perceptual um when\n65:43 we start talking about the parts of the\n65:45 Neuroscience that are moving your body\n65:47 we tend to call that motor Neuroscience\n65:50 you will often hear people talk about\n65:51 perceptual motor Neuroscience which\n65:53 again perceptual motor is the same\n65:55 perceptual SL motor and it&amp;#39;s kind of\n65:58 like it&amp;#39;s this connection and this kind\n65:59 of like this reality that the two parts\n66:02 are um perception in action and\n66:04 perception in motor control they&amp;#39;re sort\n66:06 of intimately\n66:08 linked um oh I should mention this too\n66:11 um in your peripheral nervous system you\n66:16 have peripheral\n66:18 neurons and your peripheral neurons come\n66:20 in two types there is perceptual and\n66:23 there&amp;#39;s motor shockingly\n66:27 and that distinction is is defined by\n66:30 basically which direction the\n66:32 information is Flowing so a motor\n66:34 command goes out from your central\n66:38 nervous system towards your periphery\n66:40 carrying a motor command so this this is\n66:43 a a neuron that&amp;#39;s connected to a you\n66:46 know motor unit in my muscle and if it\n66:49 gets sort of tapped by one of these\n66:51 higher level structures it&amp;#39;s going to\n66:54 get spikes\n66:56 that are telling it to Fire and that\n66:58 will contract the muscle um once I touch\n67:03 the cat what was the object of my plans\n67:08 um there are the the\n67:12 the the the the neurons connected to\n67:14 like the sensory um organs in my hand\n67:19 start firing differently and they send\n67:21 information back down your sensory\n67:24 peripheral nerves peripheral sensory\n67:26 nerves yeah\n67:28 so in your periphery it is just it&amp;#39;s out\n67:31 outward stuff is your motor neurons um\n67:35 inward stuff is your Sensory neurons and\n67:36 that&amp;#39;s kind of the main distinction\n67:38 there um again uh just the word cartoons\n67:42 going on there yeah why are you\n67:46 aware what&amp;#39;s that why you not like\n67:51 aware why are you not\n67:53 aware yeah\n67:56 this is one of I think the\n67:58 most troubling realities of being alive\n68:04 is that and this is also part of the the\n68:07 standard um existential crisis that\n68:10 classes like this tends to give to\n68:11 people so have fun with that um we have\n68:16 a very very thin awareness of what is\n68:21 going on under the hood in our bodies\n68:24 and we have\n68:26 we have some awareness we have some\n68:28 conscious experience of like I&amp;#39;m going\n68:29 to reach out and grab this thing I&amp;#39;m\n68:30 going to oh yeah this feels cool in my\n68:33 hand this feels hard in my hand um\n68:37 but the more you learn about\n68:39 neuroscience and the more you learn\n68:41 about what&amp;#39;s going on in the Hood the\n68:42 more you realize that those sensory that\n68:44 like the cognitive like the the\n68:46 conscious personal experience of having\n68:49 a motor experience um is a really really\n68:53 thin layer on top of a lot of complexity\n68:55 that&amp;#39;s going on and that is\n68:58 unfortunately just like the situation\n69:01 that we are in um remember one time I\n69:04 was in grad\n69:05 school and we were in like a a parking\n69:08 lot my friends and winter waiting to go\n69:10 on a hike or something like that and for\n69:13 some reason this really stuck with me\n69:14 but there was just like a puddle of like\n69:17 dirty water in the middle of the parking\n69:20 lot that had this like really beautiful\n69:23 like oil sheen on top of it and it was\n69:26 just like the sort of fractal iridescent\n69:29 colors just and by the nature of oil\n69:33 it&amp;#39;s just like one molecule thick that\n69:35 is giving this really beautiful like\n69:38 vibrant colorful shape on top of just\n69:43 cold dark murky water and I think about\n69:46 that a lot when I think about the\n69:48 nervous system because it just feels\n69:50 like that is kind of our experience of\n69:52 living in a body is we have this\n69:55 experience that is sort of riding on top\n69:58 of this really deep and\n70:00 complex biological neural complex system\n70:06 and the that conscious Sheen is related\n70:11 to the depths of what&amp;#39;s going on there\n70:13 but we don&amp;#39;t really tend to have access\n70:15 to it like I can&amp;#39;t feel my stomach\n70:18 deciding when it wants to squirt out\n70:20 more enzymes to digest my food and I\n70:23 can&amp;#39;t tell the difference between\n70:26 you know parts of this thing happening\n70:29 and you know like it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s not\n70:31 really available to me there are once\n70:34 you start learning about the about the\n70:36 bits and pieces you can start kind of\n70:39 mapping on your your conscious\n70:41 experiences to the things that I&amp;#39;m going\n70:43 to be telling you is maybe happening\n70:44 under the hood um one of the ones that&amp;#39;s\n70:47 coming to me right now for whatever\n70:49 reason is like it&amp;#39;s kind of a thing that\n70:51 is known where when when when a person\n70:53 starts lifting weights for the first\n70:54 time if you&amp;#39;ve never been a\n70:56 weightlifting person there&amp;#39;s a a thing\n70:58 that happens where you very quickly like\n71:01 you&amp;#39;ll shoot up the amount of weight\n71:03 that you can lift in a very short amount\n71:04 of time because your body is learning\n71:08 how to fire all of your motor units at\n71:10 once and that&amp;#39;s just the thing that in\n71:12 your general life you just tend not to\n71:13 do and you kind of have to learn how to\n71:15 do that like how to extend like maximal\n71:17 effort\n71:19 and that is something that&amp;#39;s happening\n71:21 at the level of like recruitment of\n71:23 motor units and so if you then if you\n71:26 now go to the gym and you start having\n71:27 that experience you sort of feel oh yeah\n71:29 I&amp;#39;m getting super strong and it&amp;#39;s just\n71:30 kind of like you can map that experience\n71:32 onto this thing I just said about how\n71:34 your motor units work but it&amp;#39;s in but\n71:36 that mapping is in the this like weird\n71:38 cognitive space like it&amp;#39;s not at that\n71:40 level of like deep awareness but then\n71:43 you have to ask like what what would\n71:45 that even look like if it was yeah so\n71:47 over time when you&amp;#39;re like lifting\n71:49 weight why do you hit\n71:51 a because eventually you you&amp;#39;re\n71:53 recruiting all of your motor units and\n71:55 then you just don&amp;#39;t have enough muscle\n71:57 to produce the force so that&amp;#39;s the that\n71:59 beginner spike in performance is you&amp;#39;re\n72:02 not actually growing muscle mass in that\n72:04 period of time you&amp;#39;re just learning how\n72:06 to actually like use all the muscles\n72:08 that you have and then you hit that\n72:09 plateau and it&amp;#39;s like okay well now I&amp;#39;m\n72:11 using I&amp;#39;m firing 100% of my muscle\n72:14 abilities just my muscles aren&amp;#39;t strong\n72:16 enough to actually move my body so and a\n72:18 lot of those sort of plateaus in\n72:20 performance can be sort of tied back to\n72:23 sort of physiological structures that\n72:24 change and like the time courses of of\n72:27 improvement happen that you know like\n72:29 growing more muscle takes time whereas\n72:31 learning how to fire motor units also\n72:34 takes time but not in the same way\n72:37 so a lot of dep there\n72:42 um that area that I was just so speaking\n72:44 of\n72:45 naming I never I&amp;#39;ve never been able to\n72:48 finish a leure before the end of class\n72:53 um that thing were just that little area\n72:56 is kind of often in the area we would\n72:58 call neuromechanics neuromechanics is a\n73:02 relatively new newly named field I would\n73:06 be curious to see if it&amp;#39;s in that\n73:08 mesh uh terminology thing we learned\n73:10 about last time um but neuromechanics\n73:14 neural mechanics um is kind of like at\n73:17 that boundary of neural activity and\n73:21 like and like physics like mechanics um\n73:25 stuff uh so that thing of like firing a\n73:28 motor unit to create a spring force that\n73:30 moves the limb that&amp;#39;s a neuromechanical\n73:33 question um and then like how that\n73:34 connects to like the spinal Central\n73:36 pattern generators you know that&amp;#39;s where\n73:38 it starts to get like is that still\n73:40 neuromechanics is that you know these\n73:41 are murky areas um on the other side of\n73:46 neuromechanics you have biomechanics\n73:48 biomechanics is\n73:49 literally Newton&amp;#39;s Laws as it applies to\n73:54 meat\n73:55 um and we will be talking about that\n73:59 uh to some level of specificity um the\n74:04 not too distant future\n74:06 um let&amp;#39;s\n74:11 see yeah let me let me finish this up\n74:14 and we&amp;#39;ll talk about\n74:16 that um yeah so biome mechanics is\n74:19 related to like just the physics of\n74:21 moving your body um we&amp;#39;re particularly\n74:23 going to talk about\n74:25 descriptions of the body that are that\n74:27 basically remove any conception of\n74:31 biology from them and just thinking\n74:32 about the human as an object that weighs\n74:36 a lot and is balanced on a pretty narrow\n74:40 uh platform and that&amp;#39;s sort of center of\n74:44 mass base of support level of uh\n74:47 description of the human body which we\n74:48 will talk about in some detail pretty\n74:51 soon um another thing I haven&amp;#39;t\n74:54 mentioned but we will talk about to is\n74:55 evolution because all of these systems\n74:58 are evolved systems they all they\n75:00 developed over billions of years um to\n75:06 the form that they currently are and in\n75:08 the same sense of things you can\n75:10 describe the system as it stands right\n75:12 now but you&amp;#39;re always going to be\n75:14 missing some of the story if you don&amp;#39;t\n75:15 think about it in the context of how it\n75:17 emerged um and so I haven&amp;#39;t quite\n75:20 figured\n75:22 out a lot of the things I&amp;#39;m talking\n75:24 about are the things that are going to\n75:25 go into these sort of numbered lectures\n75:28 once I sort of figure out how I want to\n75:30 chop things up um there&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m going to\n75:33 be extracting a lot of things from what\n75:35 your conversations are to figure out how\n75:37 to steer that those lectures um there&amp;#39;s\n75:40 some hit points that I&amp;#39;m going to hit no\n75:42 matter what you guys want to do um and\n75:44 evolution is going to be one of those\n75:46 things and\n75:47 specifically for us\n75:49 um it&amp;#39;s going to I&amp;#39;m going to be well I\n75:52 guess talk a little about the evolution\n75:53 of your eye but um I think a lot of my\n75:56 particular interest is in the thing that\n75:59 is often yeah evolution of your your\n76:02 skeleton um like why our skeletons are\n76:05 the particular weird shape that they are\n76:07 how we sort of developed from our\n76:10 Origins as fish that turn into lizards\n76:13 that turn\n76:15 into squirrels that turn into monkeys\n76:17 that turn into Apes that turn into us um\n76:21 because it matters a lot um\n76:26 evolution of our eye is another odd\n76:29 story\n76:31 uh the our retina is backwards in some\n76:34 pretty interesting ways like it&amp;#39;s not\n76:37 it&amp;#39;s like flipped in the direction that\n76:39 you would expect it to be like you would\n76:41 expect that the light sensing aspects of\n76:43 it will be facing towards the light but\n76:46 they&amp;#39;re actually backwards they face\n76:48 back and they kind of have to bounce\n76:50 through and this is thought to be\n76:51 related to like when we crawled out of\n76:53 the ocean and our eyes kind of inverted\n76:56 to\n76:56 allow the same kind of refraction to\n76:59 happen\n77:03 um yeah so uh we didn&amp;#39;t talk in this\n77:06 particular story about eye movements eye\n77:08 movements we will talk about also in\n77:10 some detail um I we have we humans have\n77:14 very mobile eyes that&amp;#39;s a very\n77:16 Cornerstone aspect of our visual system\n77:18 is that our eyes move a lot um it is\n77:22 part of the motor system to be able to\n77:25 move any part of your body including the\n77:26 eyes and that specific area is called\n77:29 ocul motor control oculo eye motor\n77:33 movement oculo motor is sort of stuff\n77:36 related to eye movements um and so\n77:40 things like ocul motor control is\n77:42 obviously very overlapping with things\n77:43 like visual perception and perceptual\n77:45 Neuroscience because as we move our eyes\n77:48 the information on the retina changes\n77:51 and we have to make and we make\n77:52 decisions about where to move our eyes\n77:55 in the same way we make decisions about\n77:56 where to move our our arms but this is\n77:59 also a place that\n78:01 like as like we you can live a whole\n78:04 happy life and like never really think\n78:07 about your eye movements but once you\n78:09 start thinking about your eye movements\n78:10 you&amp;#39;ll realize that it&amp;#39;s I think about\n78:13 it a lot like it&amp;#39;s it feels a lot like\n78:15 breathing to me where usually your\n78:19 breathing is something that just happens\n78:21 on its own but you can control it to\n78:24 some EXT like I can hold my breath I can\n78:26 take a breath I can do that I have\n78:28 volitional control over my breathing in\n78:31 a way that I don&amp;#39;t over my heart um and\n78:35 our eye movements are kind of like that\n78:36 as well like I can choose to look one\n78:38 place or another um I can choose not to\n78:40 look at something um but for the most\n78:44 part for\n78:45 99.9% of my Waking Life my eyes are just\n78:48 kind of doing what they do um and being\n78:51 driven by a combination of a ailable\n78:55 visual information and my desires of the\n78:59 world and sometimes like if I throw\n79:01 something in the air I will look at it\n79:03 and then catch it and there&amp;#39;s a lot of\n79:06 that process that is happening just\n79:09 below that level of conscious awareness\n79:12 um and that I think is a nice enough\n79:14 segue into we&amp;#39;re going to talk about for\n79:17 the last 10 minutes which is methods\n79:21 methodologies um methods is kind of a\n79:24 it&amp;#39;s just just the term that we use\n79:26 for like how in God&amp;#39;s name are you going\n79:29 to study any of this that&amp;#39;s kind of what\n79:30 methods means\n79:33 and generally speaking when we talk\n79:35 about methods we&amp;#39;re talking about\n79:38 um equipment and and ways that we can do\n79:41 empirical measurements of the world that\n79:43 will give us information about parts of\n79:47 the world that we think might we might\n79:48 be able to glean some insight into these\n79:51 deeper weirder aspects of the this is\n79:55 another great term desiderata of our\n79:58 investigation desiderata means that\n80:01 which is desired um and it is a sort of\n80:04 philosophy of science term\n80:06 about what are you trying to figure out\n80:09 you came into this room as a scientist\n80:11 because you have a certain there&amp;#39;s\n80:13 something you want to know more about\n80:14 there&amp;#39;s some part of the world that you\n80:16 want to gain insight into what is that\n80:20 thing and how how can you do it given\n80:23 all the limitations and straints and\n80:25 sort of difficulties of like how the\n80:28 world is um for me in for me in my sort\n80:32 of domain of inquiry um I I use two\n80:37 primary uh research tools map which is\n80:40 sort for motion capture um which is the\n80:43 thing if you see like behind the scenes\n80:46 stuff in movies and video games like the\n80:47 suit with the dots and stuff like that\n80:50 that&amp;#39;s motion capture and that&amp;#39;s\n80:51 basically related to um moving the body\n80:55 like sort of recording the movement of\n80:57 the body um in space and I will\n81:00 be at one of the lab sections I will be\n81:03 showing um I&amp;#39;ll be bringing in some\n81:05 cameras and doing a freeo cap recording\n81:08 which is the open source software that\n81:09 I&amp;#39;ve been building um which is designed\n81:11 to like help um record the body with a\n81:14 high degree of fidelity um like this\n81:17 specific three-dimensional configuration\n81:19 of the body at any given moment in time\n81:21 because you know I would love to be able\n81:23 to study all the Bing activity of the\n81:25 pingi cells and the cerebellum but\n81:27 that&amp;#39;s not available to me in this year\n81:29 of Our Lord\n81:30 2025 um I can&amp;#39;t actually get that\n81:33 measurement and the methods that I could\n81:34 use even if we if we if we could get\n81:36 that from something like fmri which is\n81:38 like the tube that you get the sort of\n81:40 colorful pictures of the brain um in\n81:43 this current moment in technology I\n81:46 can&amp;#39;t use that type of a tool and also\n81:49 have a person out in the world throwing\n81:51 and catching and doing stuff like that\n81:54 um\n81:55 and so we use motion capture as a\n81:58 methodology to record the 3D\n82:01 configuration of the body over time then\n82:04 we use those movements to try to infer\n82:07 while if the if the arm did this and\n82:10 gravity is like that then the muscles\n82:13 must have done this or that in order to\n82:16 produce the forces that generated that\n82:17 movement and then you kind of backtrack\n82:19 from well if the mo if the muscles did\n82:21 this then the spine must have done that\n82:23 and sort of you can use this kind of\n82:25 like this observable aspect of reality\n82:28 which is like the location of the arm\n82:31 measure it to the level of fidelity that\n82:33 you can with the available technology\n82:34 that you have and then use those\n82:37 empirical measurements to try to infer\n82:39 all this weird goopy nonsense of what\n82:41 I&amp;#39;ve been talking about about this part\n82:43 of the brain that part of the brain that\n82:44 part of the brain um the other\n82:46 technology that I tend to use a lot is I\n82:49 can draw on this board ey tracking which\n82:52 everybody loves eye tracking um it&amp;#39;s\n82:54 always a crowd favorite um but that&amp;#39;s\n82:59 another sort of\n83:00 like there&amp;#39;s different tools to use it\n83:03 but mostly these days we use video-\n83:05 based eye trackers which is literally\n83:06 just little cameras pointed at the eye\n83:10 and it&amp;#39;s kind of a a convenient thing\n83:14 that we are as humans um have these\n83:17 highly mobile eyes um that sort of wind\n83:21 up giving this really interesting\n83:23 readout of what my brain wanted to get\n83:27 more information about at each moment in\n83:29 time so if you give me a task like\n83:32 walking over rough terrain or sort of\n83:34 juggling or throwing and catching or\n83:36 something like that um you can look at\n83:39 the movement of my eye and at the very\n83:42 least know the visual information that\n83:45 was available to me in that moment by\n83:47 doing sort of 3D modeling and sort of\n83:49 saying okay the eye moved this way and\n83:51 then this the object was over here and\n83:53 so you know\n83:54 you know based on what I know about the\n83:56 eye I couldn&amp;#39;t see it then or I could\n83:58 see it in my\n84:00 periphery um and then I chose to make a\n84:02 movement that would align my eye so now\n84:04 it&amp;#39;s in my phobia and so you can use\n84:08 just like a camera pointed at the eye to\n84:10 tell the information that was being\n84:13 transmitted into my visual cortex and\n84:15 sort of going down that way which both\n84:17 gives you the information that I had\n84:20 available and more importantly arguably\n84:23 the place that my eyes move to tells me\n84:26 the place that my central nervous system\n84:28 decided I want more information from\n84:30 this part of the world and because those\n84:33 eye movements tend to happen really\n84:35 really fast like you know 150\n84:36 milliseconds per eye movement if you&amp;#39;re\n84:38 doing a difficult task um like well\n84:42 below the level of conscious awareness\n84:43 we can tell stories about what we were\n84:45 doing after the fact but in the moment\n84:47 the eyes just kind of go where they need\n84:49 to go um and so I can tell both what\n84:53 information was available to this weird\n84:55 magical meat robot at any moment in time\n84:57 and I can also look at the decisions\n85:00 that were made of oh I&amp;#39;m going to move\n85:01 my eyes this way and not that way until\n85:05 where my central nervous system desired\n85:08 more information from in the world at\n85:11 any moment in time and so in the by the\n85:13 combination of these things of being\n85:15 able to measure the sort of the\n85:17 perceptual input in the form of eye\n85:19 tracking and the motor output in the\n85:21 form of motion capture um\n85:26 Wei this is my general attempt is to my\n85:30 my general approach to scientific\n85:32 research is to try to combine these two\n85:34 methodologies to give a sense of like\n85:36 get a picture of what&amp;#39;s h of what a\n85:38 given of a what a human is doing in the\n85:40 world as they sort of perform complex\n85:42 actions and then use that weird pile of\n85:46 data that pours out of those machines to\n85:48 give some insight into this stuff often\n85:51 in my particular case\n85:54 in the sort of conversation of science\n85:57 um I I this domain this typ type of\n86:00 research tends to give ecologically\n86:03 valid like like realist like it&amp;#39;s real\n86:05 data of real people doing real stuff but\n86:07 the Fidelity is just limited like\n86:09 there&amp;#39;s only the the accuracy and\n86:11 precision of information that I can\n86:13 provide with these methods is just very\n86:14 very limited relative to someone who&amp;#39;s\n86:16 in a lab pulling out individual neurons\n86:19 and sort of doing all the reductionist\n86:21 work that they can do to get really\n86:22 precise numbers so the so the the\n86:25 sociology of Sciences people like me\n86:28 doing the broad scoke type of research\n86:31 work with people who to the more careful\n86:33 reduction of stuff and ideally we kind\n86:36 of we both work together so that we can\n86:38 tell more complete stories and tell more\n86:40 satisfying cartoon stories of what&amp;#39;s\n86:42 going on for humans to new generations\n86:45 of undergrads every every year or two\n86:51 okay get all that covered no more\n86:55 questions Neuroscience nailed it great\n86:59 cool well actually that&amp;#39;s it as there\n87:01 any um any we do have like three more\n87:04 minutes does anyone have any questions\n87:06 or what&amp;#39;s the word emotional outbursts\n87:09 uh exential\n87:11 crises uh things I wish you wish I&amp;#39;d\n87:13 said more about no one would say\n87:15 anything in this moment in class I\n87:17 appreciate oh you do like the phon thing\n87:22 about the\n87:25 yeah yeah opson opson is that&amp;#39;s the term\n87:29 Ops i n reminded me of\n87:32 like yeah yeah it&amp;#39;s the same I mean\n87:36 plants don&amp;#39;t really have the motor\n87:38 aspect but yeah that&amp;#39;s for the\n87:40 biochemistry people I think it&amp;#39;s the\n87:42 opson is the part that has the more\n87:45 there&amp;#39;s a lot of lot of depth there\n87:46 there&amp;#39;s\n87:47 only it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like a class of chemical\n87:51 and so you can you can look at that okay\n87:54 um great thank you for showing up um\n87:58 keep an eye on the Discord server\n88:00 Discord server and canvas I&amp;#39;ll make an\n88:02 announcement about the actual\n88:03 assignments going on\n88:05 um and uh yeah see you on m not an\n88:09 assignment to this what&amp;#39;s that so no\n88:11 assign this Sunday no not this Sunday\n88:13 and then I guess Monday is a holiday so\n88:16 I&amp;#39;ll see you in a\n88:18 week yeah someone here told me that\n88:20 which I was it you somebody told me\n88:22 someone told me that there was a holiday\n88:24 yeah thank you appreciate that I\n88:26 probably would have figured it\n88:29 out I didn&amp;#39;t have either one of them\n88:31 yeah I think it was just those two yeah\n88:35 exactly H okay",
    "cleaned_transcript": "We're recording now. To repeat that, the proper assignment, like the proper poster proposal assignment, will be a one or two sentence write-up on the topic area that you want your poster to be on, along with a singular citation of a paper that represents the research in the area you will be presenting on. \n\nThe standard assignment for 22.99 is that you are supposed to pick a singular paper for the whole semester, and then your poster will be you presenting just that paper. I think we can go a little bit beyond that. If that's all you want to do, that's totally valid, but I think we can do a broader overview. To keep us honest, I'm going to ask you to pick a singular paper, and the bot-mediated conversation will be designed to help you do that. \n\nSo if you say, \"Here's the topic I want to study, here's a paper I'm thinking about, here's the abstract,\" I'll prompt the bot to ask you the kinds of questions I would ask you if I had the time and energy to sit down and talk about it. Behind the curtain, when they talk about this class, most of what they tell us to do is to help you not pick a review article for your paper, but to pick an actual empirical research article. If you just search for papers on a given topic, you're going to find review articles at the top of that list, and it's not always super obvious whether you're looking at a review article, a book chapter, or an empirical study. \n\nI can tell the bot to help you with that, and it will do things like ask you about the methodologies and topics, helping you parse the very dense language that abstracts or scientific papers are typically written in. There will be some sort of simple checkbox-style assignment on Canvas and a Discord server-based conversation space. Those will be due next week, meaning 11:59 p.m. on Sunday before the following Monday. If you don't hit that deadline, there will be dire consequences—not really, but we want to keep in that general cadence so that we're all on the same path. \n\nBy the end of this next week, I will have implemented the stuff where the bot will be keeping track of a profile of your interests and trying to help in the journey you will take through this general field. But we'll see. Anytime I make a promise about the future, just know that internally I am screaming. \n\nGreat, okay, let's go ahead and get into it. I know what to do—methods. I realized I forgot motion capture tracking, etc. I also forgot a piece of equipment that I intended to bring today, so I will use this instead. Someone doesn't know how to—great, that works. \n\nAlrighty, okay, so let us begin the lecture proper. It's been nice for the first part of this class seeing you guys talking about your interests in the server, kind of talking to the bot about what you're into and what you want to study. I intentionally wanted to have that part happen first before I talked too much about my own particular map of this space. I wanted to let you guys think about it for yourselves before I came up and did the traditional professor thing, which is to tell you, \"Here's what this field is, here's what this means, here's what's on topic, and here's what's off topic.\" \n\nI generally don't think that's how we should think about intellectual inquiry. In the next chunk of time, I'm going to give you an overview of this domain of human-centered neuroscience that is mostly related to my own particular history, my own research background, and the studies that I've done. By the time you have lived long enough to have specialties and personal experiences, you will have charted your own path and trajectory into the heart of some field or domain. \n\nFor pretty much all of you, for everyone who chooses to follow a route like that, you are going to have a unique path. Everybody's path is going to be different, and the topics that are relevant to everyone's interests will all be different. I don't want to present this stuff in the sense of saying, \"Here is everything that matters; here is everything that is relevant to this topic.\" I really want to keep it on a relatively personalized narrative of these are the topics that are the most important for me to study human perceptual-motor neuroscience in the ways that I specifically have learned how to do. \n\nTalking about that in the context of the component pieces of my particular specialty, I think the beauty of using AI-mediated tools in a classroom setting is that in a traditional class, the professor lays out the curriculum, the structure, and the topic area, and then you are all constrained to follow that structure. That's largely for practical reasons; it's just too hard and requires too much human labor to mediate and navigate the particular variations of interest of people in a room, even a room labeled under a particular course title. \n\nBut I think with AI, limited though it may be, it will always do its best to make whatever your interests are relevant to the topics that I have mandated it should care about. As I start going through this stuff, I encourage you to really key into your own personal feelings of interest and your own feelings of being drawn or moved by some topic or domain. If you want to follow the trajectories that I'm doing, that's all well and good, but even if you wanted to, it wouldn't happen that way because that's not how the world works. \n\nAs I give this sort of lecture, my main request for you is to not let your brain turn all the way off. I'm going to be talking fast about a lot of topics that may be relatively unfamiliar. For some of them, it might be the first time you've heard about it; for others, you might have heard about it before. The goal is not to have you understand everything I'm saying; the goal is to expose you to it. \n\nSo as I start sort of blah blah blahing at you, don't get too hung up on whether or not you're following everything. Just try to remember the words as much as you can and let it wash over you. I promise you some of it will stick. When we open things back up, you can start asking the bot or your neighbors questions about the parts that were the most interesting to you. \n\nThe part I have found most gratifying about doing this type of class is the discovery that every time empirically, when I give a lecture on a given topic and then say to 40 students, \"Ask the bot about the parts you found most interesting,\" typically what I see from that is 40 different conversations about 40 different topics, and that's really a lot of fun. \n\nWith that said, let us get into it. Unfortunately, I intended to bring a tablet so I could draw stuff with colors, and I brought the tablet, but when I looked for the pen, I found I just thrown a standard pencil into here, which I can't even imagine what was going on when I did that. So we're going to do it old school with just a singular color, but that's okay. \n\nSo the topic of the course is neuroscience. The department is biology, and most of you, as biology majors, have internalized to some degree or another, with validity, that biology and neuroscience are related to things like cells, neurons, and wet lab microscope types of conversations. Super valid, super good topics—good things to look at. \n\nAll of that is part and parcel with a particular philosophical tradition that is fundamental to the way we do scientific research in 2025 on Earth, and that is the concept of reductionism. Reductionism is just a general philosophical approach to the study of the natural world, which tries to break things down into smaller and smaller pieces so that you can make more precise measurements and investigations. \n\nThis approach has the implicit assumption that by looking at the component pieces of the world, you will be able to get a sense of the holistic view of how everything works. There is a lot of validity to that approach, but there are also obviously a lot of limitations. If you're only looking at the small pieces in isolation, you're going to have a hard time seeing what we call emergent properties—things that only really come about when you look at the combination of things at a larger scale than the kind of things you can put into a test tube and under a microscope. \n\nThe classic example of emergence is traffic. Traffic is a property of cars on a road, but you can never understand traffic by looking at a singular car. It's something that only really comes about when you're looking at the cars operating in their natural environment. The counter to reductionism is what you might call holism, but that tends to be the scale that my research domain operates in. \n\nI tend not to look at the research of people doing highly reduced electrophysiology studies where they put electrodes into the brains of various animals, or fMRI studies where they have people in a tube looking at the magnetic resonance of their hemoglobin in their brain. My particular domain of research tends to focus on humans behaving in natural environments, doing the kinds of stuff we do in our day-to-day lives. \n\nFor example, throwing things in the air and catching them involves a motor behavior of putting force into the marker, an information-gathering phase, and then another motor command. If it lines up with the world, it works out; if it doesn't, I drop it. I'm trying to understand that behavioral process in its natural context and then use the best measurements I can come up with of those behaviors, trying to attach them to the more low-level reductionist fields of inquiry. \n\nI think of it as almost like a robotics approach. I like to tell people that I study the part of neuroscience that overlaps with robotics because robotics is another field that keeps you honest in the sense that you make things that move around in the real world. You can't really cut that many corners; the thing just stops working. \n\nThe difference is that with robots, we know how they work because we made them, but they can't do all the things we want. Humans, on the other hand, we don't really know how they work, but they can do pretty much anything. There's this combination of thinking about the human as a magical meat robot and trying to study it from that perspective, which can lead to a lot of useful results. \n\nThe nice thing about that is the abstraction away from the biology and the knowledge that it is, in fact, under the hood, cells and neurons and membrane potentials and things like that. We think about it more in terms of the things we can measure, which we will talk about shortly. \n\nSpeaking of the natural world, let's talk about something that is one of the ways to parse out that general topic, which is called the perception-action cycle. Let's start by drawing a brain. I'm trying to draw it. Yes, let's do it like that. \n\nSo here's how you draw a brain. There you go. Sorry, try and you'll figure it out. Okay, so this is your brain. This is a picture of your brain. That's your temporal lobe; this is your eye; you're facing that way. There are a lot of details that are not being covered here, but this is the general shape. \n\nSo here you are; that's you and your existence in the world. Let's see, let's do this a different way. There you go; that's you. You're in the world, and here's your body. Here's your eye; here's your mouth, and then inside of there, that's your brain—not to scale. \n\nAs you are in the world, you have a very limited awareness of your given context, and everything you know comes in through your senses and your memory. Let's think about a particular moment in time where you're sitting here, you have your eye, and then you see out here there's a cat. You like cats. \n\nSo the image—light from the sun bounces off the cat and goes into your eye. We'll talk a lot about eyes; we'll talk about the lens, we'll talk about the retina, we'll talk about the fovea, and we'll talk about the optic nerve. The main thing is that your eye is the place where environmental energy is first absorbed by your nervous system. \n\nThis moment right here is a very special moment in your perceptual cycle, which is the moment of transduction. This is the term for the moment when some form of environmental energy—in this case, light—gets transduced and converted into neural activity in your eye. The light goes in, it goes into your retina, into your fovea, which we'll talk plenty about. \n\nThere's a particular class of molecules called opsins. Opsins look roughly like this: a hexagon with a long wiggly tail. People in biochemistry will probably recognize these shapes. You have a bunch of these opsins in your eye, and there are basically three main ones. They are tuned, if you want to use that term, to different wavelengths of light. \n\nThe nature of them is that when a photon of light hits them, they absorb the energy of that photon and then change shape. I think I actually did this backwards; I think they start out with a kink, and then when they absorb the light, they straighten out. But whatever happens, this absorption of a photon changes the electrochemical properties of the molecule, and it goes from being neutral to a positive or negative charge. \n\nThe point is that the light coming from the environment, bouncing off the cat, entering your eye, and changing the chemical layout of the opsin happens in the trillions and billions of instances that biology tends to operate in. This changes the polarity and the electrical state of the rods and cones in your retina, which get accumulated with ganglia and various other stuff. \n\nThis leads to a shift in the electrical potential in that section of your retina, which then gets sent in as spikes down your optic nerve. Neurons are the things that neuroscience is made of, and mostly what neurons do is they spike; they send little electrical pulses, and that's how they communicate that whatever that neuron has tuned to has occurred. \n\nFor perception, for vision, it's this absorption of light into the opsin and the shift in this polarity, and then the change in that electrical state that leads to a change in the spike rate of a given ganglion cell as it sends its axon down the optic nerve into your occipital lobe and the visual cortex. \n\nWe're going to talk more about this in more detail and more coherently, but the important thing here is that the light that has been absorbed by your eye gets converted through this strange biochemical machine into a pattern of neural activity. Because the neural activity is caused by the light, and because the light has been reflected off the object in question, there is a general belief and assumption that the pattern of neural activity has some relationship with the object in the real world. \n\nThere's some statistical correlation; the pattern of neural activity somehow encodes information about the world that you're looking at. The nature of that relationship is tenuous and complex, and generally speaking, extremely impoverished. The actual information we get in any one moment in time is far less than you think it would be. \n\nThe richness of your visual environment, for example, is very much an illusion based on your brain's ability to cobble together a lot of noisy information to give you something that's accurate enough to move through the world, but often in a sort of designed after-the-fact way. \n\nSo that's your brain again. It's more like a brain, but that's fine. Your optic nerve—the light comes into your eye, gets absorbed by the retina, which is on the back of your eye, and sends a pattern of neural activity down your optic nerve. It passes through some subcortical areas, the thalamus, and stuff like that, which we won't talk much about, but there is some stuff that happens here. \n\nThen it projects down to the occipital lobe, which is otherwise known as the visual cortex, located in the back of your brain. It's not super important to know where it is, but it's just one of those things—vision happens here for whatever reason. This is the place where the first pass of information about your visual environment starts to get computed, mostly in the form of edges, dark patches, light patches, and so on. \n\nOnce you get from V1, which is the primary visual cortex, it goes through other stages of processing that lead to more and more complex structures emerging. You start with things like edges, and if you have enough edges, you can get patches. If you get patches, then you can get textures, and if you get textures, you can get objects. Each stage of visual processing builds on the stage before to eventually lead to the ability to do things like object recognition—like, \"Oh, that thing out there is a cat.\" \n\nThere's a conversation we can have about the parts of that process that go down this lobe, which is your temporal lobe, which tends to be the object space—like, \"That's a desk, that's a computer.\" The part we tend to care more about in this class is the part that goes up this direction, which tends to be more in tune with using that information to plan your movement out in the world. \n\nSomething I haven't mentioned yet, but is worth repeating, is that this is obviously a cartoon. This is a very abstracted, simplified version of a story. If you wanted to tell the whole story, you would have to tell a thousand stories of a thousand humans in their labs recording data, getting a bunch of numbers, and then making up their own stories in the discussion sections of their own papers about what the different parts mean. \n\nThis cartoonified story is the version that tends to make it into the textbooks that we communicate back to you and try to make sense of. It's really important to remember that this is not the real story; this is the cartoon. The real story is something we don't actually have access to. \n\nThere's no level of class where I can just give you the book that says, \"Here is what the visual cortex is actually doing.\" The best I could ever do is give you a record of all the empirical measurements that all the humans who have ever investigated this have put together and then tell you the story that we have collectively decided is the best story we can come up with for how we think this part of this lumpy pink thing inside of all our skulls is operating. \n\nBut there is a gap—an essential gap—between epistemology, which is our knowledge of things, and metaphysics, which is what actually exists. The two things never truly touch; there is always going to be a difference between knowing something and what that thing actually is. \n\nIn the history of science, we have told many stories about what we think is going on in the world, in our bodies, and in our goopy bits. Historically, over time, every single one of those stories, on a long enough time scale, has proven wrong in some sense. Everything we currently think will eventually be proven wrong in some way or another. Evidence for that is everything we've ever thought up until this point has been proven wrong in some way or another. \n\nSo as you think there's something special about today that is going to keep happening indefinitely until the sun burns out, the beauty of the scientific process is that we have this belief that even though everything has been wrong, there is a sense that each successive idea is less wrong than the one before it. Less wrong means that it allows us to make more precise predictions, heal sickness better, and build machines that do more exciting things. \n\nSometimes those improvements happen by completely throwing out philosophical base-level beliefs about how certain things work. But yeah, it's a continuous process. We'll talk about it. \n\nSo here we are in this cycle: the light has bounced off the cat, it has hit your eye, it has been absorbed, it has been transmitted back to your visual cortex. You have identified that it's a cat, and you have an inbuilt volition that says, \"I like to touch cats.\" Great, we support this for you. \n\nThis is the parietal lobe. Don't worry about the parietal lobe; it's great, but you can worry about it if you want. The important part is that this back here is your visual cortex. This on the side here, roughly speaking, is your motor cortex. \n\nEventually, as you look at more and more pictures of the brain, you will see that the wrinkles and stuff on the brain are not random; they are conserved. In the same sense that while every face looks very different, they generally have two eyes, a nose, and a mouth in different configurations, the wrinkly stuff and the crevices and bumps on our brains are roughly the same. \n\nIf you were to crack open all the brains in this room—which I don't recommend—you would find a lot of correspondence in where the big creases and stuff come in. I'm not at the level of that anatomy where I can name them off the top of my head, but I do recognize them in pictures. \n\nIt's easy to tell when someone is drawing a brain artistically versus when they're looking at anatomy because artists often just say, \"Oh yeah, it's a bunch of pink wrinkles,\" and it's like, \"Okay, well, that's not actually how we do.\" \n\nAnyways, there's a big one right in the middle called the central sulcus. A sulcus is like the crease part. On this side of that sulcus is the somatosensory cortex. Somatosensation is basically touch—think of that type of sensation. On that side is the motor cortex. \n\nThe sensory cortex and the motor cortex tend to be paired. You can look up the homunculus when we talk about the motor cortex. I enjoy this distinction. There are these two sides of the brain: on this side, it's kind of like sensation and the perception of the world, like visual aspects and sensory aspects. On this side of the brain is where we start getting to motor actions and movements and the outgoing parts of things. \n\nAs we keep going forward, you eventually get over here to the frontal lobes. The frontal lobe is the big lumpy part in the front; that's the most human part of the brain. All mammal brains are roughly the same anatomically; they're just very fun mirrored into different shapes and sizes. \n\nRats have a much more pronounced olfactory bulb for smell versus their visual cortex, and the human brain has a lot of extra anatomy in that frontal lobe area. This is thought to be where decision-making comes from; this is where language kind of lives. It's often referenced in executive function, the feeling of deciding what you want to do. \n\nThis is also where metacognition happens. If you're having thoughts about your thoughts—like, \"Oh yeah, I'm angry right now\"—that's a frontal lobe area. Just reiterating the point: every time I point to a part of the brain and say, \"This is the part that does this thing,\" a little part of me inside is screaming and dying because none of this is how any of it works. \n\nThat's the cartoon; that's not how the real world is set up. It's much more complex and much noisier than that. If I say, \"This is where executive function happens,\" and I point at the front of the brain, and then say, \"This is where vision happens,\" and I point at the back of the brain, that statement is more true than if I switch those two things around. \n\nIt's important to reiterate that even though I'm telling you these simplified stories—these textbook-level conversations about how the brain works—this is the stuff that if we come back to this class in 250 years, we're going to be saying very different things. But we'll probably still say something like, \"Vision happens in the back, and cognition happens in the front.\" \n\nFrom this frontal lobe, you get the frontal area, executive functions, and then you get your premotor area. Somewhere around here is where volitions arise. Volition is sort of the same root as voluntary; it's like the things that you want to do. \n\nYou see the cat and say, \"I want to touch the cat.\" Here is the cat, and look at me, I'm touching it. This is what I want to happen. Now you are in a state where here's your body, here's your hand, and here's this cat. There's this desire that I wish my hand was on this cat. \n\nNow there's a gap between the way the world is in your perception and the way you wish the world would be, which is that your hand is touching this object. Those volitions meld with the perceptual experience, and from this alchemy emerges something resembling a motor plan. \n\nI'm trying to stop myself from going into details because we're going to have a whole lecture about the eye, a whole lecture about the motor cortex, and we're going to talk about this in more detail. I'm just giving the overview. \n\nBut this is where we would call something the first time we start seeing something resembling a motor plan. There are a lot of times in the chats you all have been having where you talk about things like muscle memory. Muscle memory is a term we like to use; it's a very standard human expression. \n\nBut it's also one of those things that doesn't really exist in a physiological sense. Your muscles don't have memory; they're much simpler objects, which we will talk about. Usually, when you say muscle memory, you mean motor plan. As you work on something more and more and gain more expertise and experience, what we tend to refer to as muscle memory is really the motor plans becoming more robust and locked in. \n\nTypically, where a lot of that motor planning takes place is not necessarily in the motor cortex, but most of that starts happening in subcortical regions. If you think about a picture of the brain, the pink wrinkly thing in your skull is the cortex; that's the neocortex. It's the part where most of the processing happens, which we'll talk a little about. \n\nI like to talk about this as the bloom of the rose on the rose bush. When you think about the nervous system and look at a rose bush, it makes a lot of sense that we tend to focus on the rose—the red thing with petals that smells nice. We spend a lot of our time focusing on that part of the plant for very good reason. \n\nBut if you take a step back and look at it from a botany point of view, it's mostly bush and just a little bit of rose. I think that's kind of the same with the way our cortex works. The majority of our central nervous system is not in that cortex; it's in the subcortical regions. \n\nAmong my favorite of those subcortical regions is the cerebellum, which looks kind of like a fist-shaped thing that sits right below your cortex. When you look up pictures of the brain online, you'll see the big pink wrinkly thing and this more dense, grayish-looking thing underneath it. That's your cerebellum. \n\nYour cerebellum is a very complicated beast. It contains about 3.5 times as many neurons as the rest of your central nervous system combined. That number is strangely conserved across different animals, particularly mammals. We all have a cortex; we all have a cerebellum. We have very different brain-to-body ratios and different proportions, but in general, however big your brain is, whatever animal you are, your cerebellum has three and a half times as many neurons as the rest of your cortex. \n\nI always come back to that; it seems interesting. I wish I knew more about it. Your cerebellum has so many more neurons by count because the neurons associated with it are tiny. You have granule cells and Purkinje cells. \n\nI'm going to look up pictures of these because Purkinje cells in your cerebellum are one of the more beautiful parts of your brain. You have the cell body, the axon, and then these are all the synapses. There are thousands upon thousands of them. \n\nThis picture is famous; it was taken by Ramon y Cajal, who was part of the group that came up with the staining mechanisms that allowed us to start looking at neurons in isolation. This happened around 1909. Before that, we didn't really know what neurons were and didn't know if they were just one big mass or individualized pieces. There was a big scientific and philosophical debate about whether the brain is all one big connected piece or if the neurons touch or are separated from each other. \n\nRamon Cajal argued in favor of the synapse doctrine, which said there was a gap between them. I think it was Golgi who argued that they were all touching. Golgi came up with a silver nitrate staining process that allowed them to make images like this, ironically proving Cajal's side of the argument correct. They both shared a Nobel Prize, but apparently, they had such bad blood between them that they spent their entire speech bashing each other. \n\nSo there you go. Your cerebellum consists of Purkinje cells and granule cells, which in comparison look more like this. They're small and don't have these super long fibers that go long distances; they're much more localized and only connect to their immediate neighbors. The majority of neurons in your nervous system are these granule cells that live in your cerebellum. \n\nYour cerebellum is a layered structure. Like most parts of your brain, the layers tend to operate phylogenetically, so the outside is the newest stuff, and the inside is the older stuff. The cerebellum has that structure. We may talk about it; I'm not sure. We'll see. \n\nIt's one of those things where if enough people talk to the bot and ask about this, I might steer the lectures based on the interest of the class. But anyway, we're talking about cats. \n\nSo light hits the cat, hits your eye, is absorbed in your retina, tweaks your opsins, triggers a neural cascade, vibrates your visual cortex, and gives you the perception of a cat. Your volitional desire to touch the cat, combined with the knowledge that there's a cat in front of you, starts creating a motor plan. \n\nThis is where the cartoon gets really cartoony because there's a lot of controversy about the different steps of this process. But long story short, something in the combination of your motor cortex and your cerebellum—which is largely a motor-based thing, mostly dealing with movement—is thought to be related to tool use. \n\nThis is something that we humans can do: we pick up an object and quickly learn the physics of it, using it as a tool. This is thought to be a neocortex thing. The neocortex is the new part; it's on the outside; it's complicated. \n\nThere's a hierarchical nature to your motor system. At the higher levels, where the top is pretty much the frontal lobe, the plans are much more abstract. It's things like, \"I'm thirsty; I wish I was drinking water right now.\" \n\nIn order for that high-level volition to be turned into something that can lead me to my goal, there has to be a pairing down of specificity from that very high-level volition down to something that, at some level, is going to have to boil down to muscle firings to move my body through space. \n\nSo as I say, \"Oh, I wish I had water,\" I see that there's water over there, and somehow that volition is converted into motor commands that move my legs. Now my body is in a place where I can move my arm, I know how this thing works, so I open the thing and get to drink water. \n\nThat process tends to go from the motor cortex, then to the cerebellum, and then your cerebellum has connections to your brainstem. I say connections, but they're really kind of wrapped around each other. You have your brainstem, your medulla oblongata, and your pons. \n\nThat's the part of your brain people talk about when they refer to your reptilian brain. That's the part that handles things like, \"Is my heart beating? Am I breathing? Is my temperature within a livable range?\" That tends to be controlled at your brainstem. \n\nYour brainstem is the start of your spinal cord, which is another good friend. There you go; perfect. Nice job. Your spinal cord is part of your central nervous system. Oftentimes, when we think about the spinal cord, it's given a bad rap. \n\nEven when we look at pictures of the central nervous system, you'll often see pictures that stop here, just sort of focused on that rose on the bush. We often cut off where the spine is, but your spine is just as much a part of your nervous system as the rest of it. \n\nSpecifically, the way we're going to define the central nervous system as opposed to the peripheral nervous system is loosely that the central nervous system is where processing happens. Processing is a very goopy term that basically means information is coming in, some sort of conversion is happening—which we might call a computation if we wanted to use a computer analogy—and then information goes out. \n\nThe spine is doing that kind of processing at various levels, which we will also talk about. I find it fascinating, and there are some stories we will talk about later in the semester of studies that we aren't allowed to do anymore on cats. \n\nYou can sever the spine—cut the spine so it no longer connects to the upper part of the brain—and the cat can still do things like walk because the spine houses the gray matter that handles things like central pattern generation and reflex responses. \n\nA central pattern generator is a thing that handles the basic rhythmic motion of my legs and says, \"One foot is going to be in stance, and the other one's going to be in swing, and then they're going to swap off.\" A lot of that processing is handled in the spine itself. \n\nYour spinal cord ends around here, right below your thoracic spine. The stuff below that is called the cauda equina, which becomes more extension-cord-like. You start to lose the gray matter and get more peripheral nerves that go out to your limbs. \n\nI also want to make the point that the distinction between the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system is often stated as a hard delineation, but there's a lot of gray area. One of the most classic gray areas is the retina. \n\nThe retina has a lot of neurons on the back of it, and there are layers to it. It's often described as the eye being the classical sensory organ, but there's stuff happening on the back of the retina before anything even leaves on that optic nerve to pass to the brain that could be considered computation. \n\nSimilarly, your skin has a lot of connections in it that might be doing things we might consider computation. That's why when you get hurt, if you rub the area, it doesn't hurt as much because the activity of activating sensory organs around the damaged area suppresses the feeling coming from the damaged area. That is all happening at the level of your skin. \n\nThese names and terms are not like nature is divided into pieces with departments and names; that's a thing we humans did to nature so we could have any hope of making sense of it. Anytime we put a name or a label or a category into nature, we're always going to be making concessions and drawing lines around areas because it allows us to have better conversations about those things. \n\nBut there's always going to be gray areas, and often those gray areas or the cracks tend to lead us to abandon certain thoughts and go towards others. \n\nSpeaking of the peripheral nervous system, this is your arm. These are your bones, and your bones are mostly what you are. If we're thinking about it in terms of the space you inhabit, the shape that you are, and your general ability to move through the world, it's mostly bones. \n\nAll the goop associated with that is sort of the details, but the general cookie-cutter shape of you as a creature is driven by these weird sticks, and these weird sticks have weird things attached to them called muscles. \n\nEventually, one of the things that happens when you think about the more holistic picture of the world and the way you live in it is that if you're in a lab, living a reductionist life where you're choosing a particular domain of inquiry, you can remove all the parts of the question that you don't want to look at. \n\nIf you're a neuroscientist, you might take the mouse, rat, or fruit fly into the lab and remove all the parts that aren't neuroscience so you can have a better picture of the neurons you care about. When you don't have that capacity and want to think about things more generally, you don't have that luxury. \n\nIf you want to think about how humans move through the world, even if you care mostly about the neural aspects of it, you are required by the nature of reality to consider things like bones and muscles, even though those are not particularly neural objects. \n\nWhen we move, all this weird neural activity is eventually going to have to transmit down into something that moves the body through the world. This is where we get to the robotics conversation because this is the part where the neural activity, which has been originally transduced into this sensory experience of vision, is eventually going to get boiled down to something that flips that coin around. \n\nNow the neural activity is going to be converted into environmental energy, in this case, in the form of mechanical energy. It's going to squeeze my muscle, and my arm is going to move. This has literal energy in this movement, specifically in the form of kinetic energy. \n\nIf I'm pulling on a spring or something like that, it might be mechanical energy—potential energy, kinetic energy, spring energy. That's the stuff we get from our muscles. The whole perception-action cycle is this conversion of environmental energy into perceptual neural activity, back down into a motor action. \n\nMuscles are weird objects. A muscle is effectively a variable stiffness spring; that's pretty much what a muscle is. Muscles only pull; they cannot push. When it looks like I'm pushing, it's because this muscle is pulling on the tip of that bone so that my arm goes that way. That's called extension. \n\nIf I want to squeeze this one, I send a motor command down there. It fires the motor units and says, \"Hey, surrounding muscle tissue, contract.\" What was originally a fairly wiggly soft spring gets electrified and becomes a rather stiff spring, pulling this joint up. \n\nThere are paired muscle groups: a flexor muscle group and an extensor muscle group. Those two things operate in conjunction to move this degree of freedom. \n\nThe motor plan that comes down from the motor cortex and through the cerebellum—if you're a fancy type of animal like a human—goes through the corticospinal tract. There is a connection straight from your motor cortex down to your spine, bypassing things like your cerebellum. \n\nAll animals have a corticospinal tract, but not to equal degree. That's one of the interesting distinctions in the animal kingdom. This is one of my favorite questions; I actually use this question to test AI models to see how they do at neuroscience. \n\nI ask about the corticospinal tract and how it varies across the animal kingdom because that's one of the places where the questions get really subtle. I can look at how it does at that answer to see if I'm looking at a local model I can run on my computer. I can watch it get the subtle parts wrong when I ask it that kind of question. \n\nA lot of what I've been talking about—how motor cortex motor commands go through the cerebellum and the brainstem—is true, but there is also this corticospinal tract. Anytime you see one of those big words with an \"o\" in the middle, just replace the \"o\" with a slash. So corticospinal is C cortex SL spinal. That just basically goes straight from the cortex down to the spine, bypassing all the subcortical regions. \n\nIt's what allows us to control our individual degrees of freedom of our body directly, as opposed to doing things in a more synergistic way, which is way deeper than I want to talk about in this particular lecture. \n\nChewing that clock is killing me. So here I am, so close. I'm so ready to almost touch this cat. My motor plan, which has come down from on high through the hierarchical structure of our motor system, has taken my awareness of the world and my own body. \n\nThe vision gives me information about remote parts of the world—things I cannot touch, things that are outside of my peripersonal space. The peripersonal space is the area that I can touch with my hands. Outside of that is a different part of the world. \n\nThat's kind of happening in the parietal lobe. One of my favorite studies is where they got a monkey, trained it to grab things on a desk, and then gave it a temporary lesion. They squirted something into the part of the brain that handles that peripersonal perception, so that part of the brain kind of goes offline. \n\nYou get what's called cortical blindness, so the monkey loses its ability to see things in that peripersonal zone. Then they took the monkeys and trained them to use a grabber arm, like a claw arm, so now its reach is farther because it can use this arm. \n\nWhen they asked the monkey to use it after they taught it how to use it and then lesioned that peripersonal zone, the blind spot increased to include the region that could be reached with the grabber in addition to the hand. \n\nPut that into your worldview and see how it fits. So here I am; I see this cat, and I have this awareness of my body. A lot of this is associated with proprioception. As my arm is out here, it is putting force on my joints because of the weight of the arm, and my body can encode and is aware of those forces. \n\nI can use that to be aware of where my arm is. I can also see my arm; I have a memory of lifting it up. There are a lot of ways that we know where our bodies are, but I know that it's here. If I can make this part move that way, then I will have achieved my deepest desire of touching this cat. \n\nThere's a lot of complicated stuff about how we don't move our body one joint at a time; we move it in a sort of barely sophisticated dance. A lot of that breakdown of how we choose to break down a complex movement across the available joints in the context of the world—that's a cerebellum thing again. \n\nBut let's pretend like it's not. I relax the flexor, tighten the extensor, and that puts a torque on this bone, which moves my hand here. Now I have the reward of cat sensations under my hand, and I have achieved this goal of mine. \n\nThat's the loop. That's one path through that perception-action loop. Now that the information has gone in, been processed, and I've moved my body, I have changed the state of the world. My body is now in the world, so as I'm perceiving the situation as it stands, I'm perceiving something different. \n\nNow I'm going to go back through that loop. You perceive, you act, and then you take in the information. That loop is where you live your whole life. \n\nThis is kind of the cartoon overview of the story as it holds. I will name some of the fields associated with the things we talked about. Generally speaking, when we talk about the physiology of the eyeball, it tends to be called optology, I guess. \n\nThat's more about the lens and pupil and the goopy parts. Once you're talking about the neural activity aspect of it, we tend to call that visual neuroscience or perceptual neuroscience because we are such vision-heavy animals as humans. Often when you hear \"perceptual,\" we tend to mean visual, but strictly speaking, it's anything sensory. \n\nWhen we start talking about the parts of neuroscience that are moving your body, we tend to call that motor neuroscience. You will often hear people talk about perceptual-motor neuroscience, which again is the same as perceptual SL motor. It's this connection and the reality that perception and action, and perception and motor control, are intimately linked. \n\nI should mention this too: in your peripheral nervous system, you have peripheral neurons, and your peripheral neurons come in two types. There are perceptual and motor neurons. Shockingly, that distinction is defined by which direction the information is flowing. \n\nA motor command goes out from your central nervous system towards your periphery, carrying a motor command. This is a neuron that's connected to a motor unit in my muscle, and if it gets tapped by one of these higher-level structures, it's going to get spikes that tell it to fire, which will contract the muscle. \n\nOnce I touch the cat, what was the object of my plans? The neurons connected to the sensory organs in my hand start firing differently and send information back down your sensory peripheral nerves. \n\nIn your periphery, the outward stuff is your motor neurons, and the inward stuff is your sensory neurons. That's kind of the main distinction there. \n\nAgain, just the word \"cartoons\" going on there. Why are you not aware? This is one of the most troubling realities of being alive, and this is also part of the standard existential crisis that classes like this tend to give to people. So have fun with that. \n\nWe have a very thin awareness of what is going on under the hood in our bodies. We have some awareness; we have some conscious experience of, \"I'm going to reach out and grab this thing,\" or, \"Oh yeah, this feels cool in my hand; this feels hard in my hand.\" \n\nBut the more you learn about neuroscience and what’s going on under the hood, the more you realize that the cognitive, conscious personal experience of having a motor experience is a really thin layer on top of a lot of complexity that's going on. That is unfortunately just the situation we are in. \n\nI remember one time I was in grad school, and we were in a parking lot with my friends in winter, waiting to go on a hike or something. For some reason, this really stuck with me, but there was a puddle of dirty water in the middle of the parking lot that had this really beautiful oil sheen on top of it. \n\nIt had these fractal iridescent colors. By the nature of oil, it's just one molecule thick, giving this really beautiful, vibrant, colorful shape on top of cold, dark, murky water. I think about that a lot when I think about the nervous system because it feels like our experience of living in a body is riding on top of this really deep and complex biological neural system. \n\nThat conscious sheen is related to the depths of what's going on there, but we don't really have access to it. I can't feel my stomach deciding when it wants to squirt out more enzymes to digest my food, and I can't tell the difference between parts of this thing happening. \n\nIt's just not really available to me. Once you start learning about the bits and pieces, you can start mapping your conscious experiences to the things that I'm going to be telling you are maybe happening under the hood. \n\nOne of the ones that comes to mind is that when a person starts lifting weights for the first time, if you've never been a weightlifting person, there's a thing that happens where you quickly shoot up the amount of weight you can lift in a very short amount of time because your body is learning how to fire all your motor units at once. \n\nThat's just something you tend not to do in your general life, and you have to learn how to do that—how to extend maximal effort. That's happening at the level of recruitment of motor units. \n\nIf you now go to the gym and start having that experience, you feel, \"Oh yeah, I'm getting super strong.\" You can map that experience onto this thing I just said about how your motor units work, but that mapping is in this weird cognitive space. \n\nIt's not at the level of deep awareness, but then you have to ask, \"What would that even look like?\" \n\nSo over time, when you're lifting weights, why do you hit a plateau? Eventually, you're recruiting all your motor units, and you just don't have enough muscle to produce the force. That beginner spike in performance is because you're not actually growing muscle mass in that period of time; you're just learning how to use all the muscles you have. \n\nThen you hit that plateau, and it's like, \"Okay, well now I'm firing 100% of my muscle abilities; my muscles just aren't strong enough to actually move my body.\" A lot of those plateaus in performance can be tied back to physiological structures that change. \n\nThe time courses of improvement happen; growing more muscle takes time, whereas learning how to fire motor units also takes time, but not in the same way. \n\nThat area I was just talking about is often in the area we would call neuromechanics. Neuromechanics is a relatively newly named field. I would be curious to see if it's in that mesh terminology thing we learned about last time. \n\nNeuromechanics is at the boundary of neural activity and physics—mechanics. That thing of firing a motor unit to create a spring force that moves the limb is a neuromechanical question. \n\nHow that connects to spinal central pattern generators—that's where it starts to get murky. On the other side of neuromechanics, you have biomechanics. Biomechanics is literally Newton's laws as they apply to meat. \n\nWe will be talking about that to some level of specificity in the not-too-distant future. Biomechanics is related to the physics of moving your body. We're particularly going to talk about descriptions of the body that basically remove any conception of biology from them and just think about the human as an object that weighs a lot and is balanced on a pretty narrow platform. \n\nThat's the center of mass and base of support level of description of the human body, which we will talk about in some detail pretty soon. \n\nAnother thing I haven't mentioned but we will talk about is evolution because all of these systems are evolved systems. They developed over billions of years to the form they currently are. \n\nYou can describe the system as it stands right now, but you're always going to be missing some of the story if you don't think about it in the context of how it emerged. I haven't quite figured out a lot of the things I'm talking about that are going to go into these numbered lectures. \n\nOnce I figure out how I want to chop things up, I'm going to extract a lot of things from your conversations to steer those lectures. There are some hit points I'm going to hit no matter what you guys want to do, and evolution is going to be one of those things. \n\nSpecifically for us, I'm going to talk a little about the evolution of your eye, but a lot of my particular interest is in the evolution of your skeleton—why our skeletons are the particular weird shape they are, how we developed from our origins as fish that turned into lizards, that turned into squirrels, that turned into monkeys, that turned into apes, that turned into us. \n\nBecause it matters a lot. The evolution of our eye is another odd story. Our retina is backwards in some interesting ways; it's flipped in the direction you would expect it to be. You would expect that the light-sensing aspects of it would be facing towards the light, but they're actually backwards. \n\nThey face back and have to bounce through, and this is thought to be related to when we crawled out of the ocean and our eyes inverted to allow the same kind of refraction to happen. \n\nWe didn't talk in this particular story about eye movements, but we will talk about that in some detail. We humans have very mobile eyes; that's a cornerstone aspect of our visual system. Our eyes move a lot. \n\nIt is part of the motor system to be able to move any part of your body, including the eyes. That specific area is called oculomotor control. Oculo means eye, and motor means movement. Oculomotor is related to eye movements. \n\nThings like oculomotor control are obviously very overlapping with things like visual perception and perceptual neuroscience because as we move our eyes, the information on the retina changes. We make decisions about where to move our eyes in the same way we make decisions about where to move our arms. \n\nYou can live a whole happy life and never really think about your eye movements, but once you start thinking about them, you'll realize that you think about it a lot. It feels a lot like breathing to me, where usually your breathing is something that just happens on its own, but you can control it to some extent. \n\nI can hold my breath; I can take a breath. I have volitional control over my breathing in a way that I don't over my heart. Our eye movements are kind of like that as well. I can choose to look one place or another; I can choose not to look at something. \n\nBut for the most part, for 99.9% of my waking life, my eyes are just kind of doing what they do, driven by a combination of available visual information and my desires of the world. Sometimes, if I throw something in the air, I will look at it and then catch it. \n\nA lot of that process is happening just below the level of conscious awareness. I think that's a nice enough segue into what we're going to talk about for the last 10 minutes, which is methods and methodologies. \n\nMethods is just the term we use for how, in God's name, are you going to study any of this? That's kind of what methods means. Generally speaking, when we talk about methods, we're talking about equipment and ways we can do empirical measurements of the world that will give us information about parts of the world we think we might glean some insight into. \n\nThis is another great term: desiderata of our investigation. Desiderata means that which is desired. It's a philosophy of science term about what you're trying to figure out. You came into this room as a scientist because there's something you want to know more about—some part of the world you want to gain insight into. \n\nWhat is that thing, and how can you do it given all the limitations and constraints and difficulties of how the world is? For me, in my domain of inquiry, I use two primary research tools: motion capture, which is the thing you see behind-the-scenes stuff in movies and video games—the suit with the dots and stuff like that. \n\nThat's motion capture, and it's related to recording the movement of the body in space. I will be at one of the lab sections showing you some cameras and doing a freeo cap recording, which is the open-source software I've been building. \n\nIt's designed to help record the body with a high degree of fidelity—like this specific three-dimensional configuration of the body at any given moment in time. I would love to study all the activity of the Purkinje cells and the cerebellum, but that's not available to me in this year of our Lord 2025. \n\nI can't actually get that measurement, and the methods I could use—even if we could get that from something like fMRI, which is the tube that gives you colorful pictures of the brain—in this current moment in technology, I can't use that type of tool and also have a person out in the world throwing and catching and doing stuff like that. \n\nSo we use motion capture as a methodology to record the 3D configuration of the body over time. Then we use those movements to try to infer, \"Well, if the arm did this and gravity is like that, then the muscles must have done this or that in order to produce the forces that generated that movement.\" \n\nYou backtrack from, \"If the muscles did this, then the spine must have done that.\" You can use this observable aspect of reality, which is the location of the arm, measure it to the level of fidelity you can with the available technology, and then use those empirical measurements to try to infer all this weird goopy nonsense about this part of the brain, that part of the brain, and that part of the brain. \n\nThe other technology I tend to use a lot is eye tracking, which everybody loves. It's always a crowd favorite. That's another sort of—there are different tools to use it, but mostly these days we use video-based eye trackers, which are literally just little cameras pointed at the eye. \n\nIt's a convenient thing that we humans have these highly mobile eyes that give this interesting readout of what my brain wanted to get more information about at each moment in time. If you give me a task like walking over rough terrain or juggling or throwing and catching, you can look at the movement of my eye. \n\nAt the very least, you know the visual information that was available to me in that moment by doing 3D modeling and saying, \"Okay, the eye moved this way, and the object was over here.\" You know based on what I know about the eye that I couldn't see it then, or I could see it in my periphery. \n\nThen I chose to make a movement that would align my eye so now it's in my fovea. You can use just a camera pointed at the eye to tell the information that was being transmitted into my visual cortex. \n\nMore importantly, arguably, the place that my eyes move to tells me where my central nervous system decided it wanted more information from in the world at any moment in time. Those eye movements tend to happen really fast—like 150 milliseconds per eye movement if you're doing a difficult task—well below the level of conscious awareness. \n\nWe can tell stories about what we were doing after the fact, but in the moment, the eyes just kind of go where they need to go. By combining these two methodologies—being able to measure the perceptual input in the form of eye tracking and the motor output in the form of motion capture—this is my general attempt. \n\nMy general approach to scientific research is to combine these two methodologies to get a picture of what a human is doing in the world as they perform complex actions. Then I use that weird pile of data that pours out of those machines to give some insight into this stuff, often in my particular case in the conversation of science. \n\nThis type of research tends to give ecologically valid, realistic data of real people doing real stuff, but the fidelity is just limited. The accuracy and precision of information I can provide with these methods is very limited relative to someone who's in a lab pulling out individual neurons and doing all the reductionist work they can do to get really precise numbers. \n\nThe sociology of science is that people like me doing the broad scope type of research work with people who do the more careful reduction of stuff. Ideally, we both work together so we can tell more complete stories and tell more satisfying cartoon stories of what's going on for humans to new generations of undergrads every year or two. \n\nOkay, I think I covered all that. No more questions? Neuroscience nailed it. Great, cool. Well, actually, that's it. Do we have like three more minutes? Does anyone have any questions or emotional outbursts, existential crises, or things you wish I had said more about? \n\nNo one would say anything in this moment in class. I appreciate it. Oh, you do like the opsin thing? Yeah, opsin—that's the term. Opsin reminded me of—yeah, it's the same. I mean, plants don't really have the motor aspect, but yeah, that's for the biochemistry people. \n\nI think opsin is the part that has more depth there. There's a lot of depth there. Great, thank you for showing up. Keep an eye on the Discord server and Canvas. I'll make an announcement about the actual assignments going on. \n\nSee you on—oh, not an assignment this Sunday? No, not this Sunday. I guess Monday is a holiday, so I'll see you in a week. Yeah, someone here told me that. Was it you? Somebody told me. Someone told me there was a holiday. \n\nYeah, thank you; I appreciate that. I probably would have figured it out. I didn't have either one of them. I think it was just those two. Yeah, exactly. Okay.",
    "transcript_text": "we&amp;#39;re recording now um so to repeat that um the the proper assignment like the the proper proper like poster proposal assignment will be on uh like a one or two sentence right up on the topic area that you&amp;#39;re going to want your poster to be on and a singular citation of a paper that kind of represents what that research what what what that like research in the area that you&amp;#39;re going to be presenting on um um the standard assignment for 22.99 is that you&amp;#39;re supposed to pick a singular paper for the whole semester and then your poster is going to be you presenting just that paper um I think we can go a little bit beyond that if that&amp;#39;s all you want to do that&amp;#39;s totally valid um but I think we can do a little bit more broad of a of an overview um and uh but to keep us kind of honest we&amp;#39;re just I&amp;#39;m going to ask you to to pick a singular paper and then the the bot me mediated conversation will be sort of designed to help you do that so if you you know give it say here&amp;#39;s the topic I want to study um here&amp;#39;s a paper I&amp;#39;m thinking about here&amp;#39;s the abstract um I&amp;#39;ll prompt I&amp;#39;ll make the bot prompted to kind of like ask you the kind of questions um that you know I would ask you if I have the time and energy to kind of sit down and talk about it um behind the curtain when they talk about this class uh the most of what they tell us to do is try to help you guys not pick a review article for your paper and to pick an actual proper like Empirical research article like because it&amp;#39;s really it&amp;#39;s like like if you just go search for papers on a given topic you&amp;#39;re going to find review articles at the top of that list and it&amp;#39;s not always super obvious whether you&amp;#39;re looking at a review article or a book chaper or like an empirical study um so I can tell the bot to help you with that uh and it&amp;#39;ll do things like asking you about the methodologies and topics and stuff like that so just kind of like helping you kind of like parse the very very dense language that an abstract or scientific papers typically written in um and so then there will be some like sort of like simple check boxy style of canvas assignment and then like a Discord server based conversation space there um and those will be ostensibly um do um next week so end of next week meaning 11:59 p.m. on Sunday before the following Monday and if you don&amp;#39;t hit that deadline there will be dire consequences um not really but it&amp;#39;s sort of we wanted to keep kind of in that General Cadence that the that we&amp;#39;re all kind of like on the same path um and probably probably by the end of this next week is when the I will have implemented the stuff where the bot will be kind of like keeping track of a profile of your interests and trying to like help in the journey that you will take through this General field um but we&amp;#39;ll see anytime I make a promise about the future just know internally I am screaming um great okay off up okay who cares um yes okay let&amp;#39;s go ahead and get into it um I know what to do methods I realized I forgot um Mo cap tracking Etc okay I also forgot a piece of equipment that I intended to bring today uh so I will use this instead someone doesn&amp;#39;t know how to great that works all righty okay so let us begin the lecture proper um so it&amp;#39;s been nice for the first part of this class kind of seeing you guys talking about your interest in the server you know kind of talking to the bot about what you&amp;#39;re into and what you want to study and things like that um and I I intentionally wanted to have that part happen first before I kind of talk about my own talk too much about my own particular sort of map of this space um because I I didn&amp;#39;t want to uh I wanted to let you guys kind of like think about it for yourselves before I came up and did like the like the traditional Professor thing which is to tell you here&amp;#39;s what this field is and here&amp;#39;s what this means and here&amp;#39;s what the here&amp;#39;s what is on topic here&amp;#39;s what is off topic um because I generally don&amp;#39;t think that that&amp;#39;s how we should think about intellectual inquiry um and the next chunk of time I&amp;#39;m going to give you an overview of this domain of human centered Neuroscience um that is mostly related to my own particular history my own research background my own the studies that I&amp;#39;ve done um and anytime that you you know by the time that you have sort of lived long enough to have Specialties and personal experiences and whatnot you will have sort of charted your own path and trajectory Into the Heart of some field or some domain um and for pretty much all of you you know for everyone that sort of chooses to follow a route kind of like that um you are going to have a sort of unique path like everybody&amp;#39;s path is going to be different and everybody&amp;#39;s sort of the the the topics that are relevant to everybody&amp;#39;s interest will all will be will be different um so I don&amp;#39;t want to present this stuff in the sense that in a sense of saying here is everything that matters here is everything that is relevant to this topic um I I really want to keep it kind of on that like relatively personalized Narrative of these are the topics that are the most important for me to be able to study human human perceptual motor Neuroscience in the ways that I specifically have learned how to do um and sort of talking about that in that Con in that context of like the the the component pieces of my particular specialty um and I think the beauty of using sort of AI mediated Tools in a classroom setting is that in a traditional class the professor kind of like lays out the curriculum lays out the structure lays out the topic area and then you are all kind of constrained to follow that structure um and that&amp;#39;s largely for practical reasons like it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s just too hard and it requires too much human labor to like really mediate and like sort of navigate the particular um sort of variations of interest of people in a room even even a room that is labeled under a particular course title um but I think with the AI you know limited though it may be it will always do a do its damnedest to sort of make whatever your interests are relevant to the topics that I have mandated it should care about um so as I start going through this stuff uh just encouraging you to really learn to key in to like your own personal feelings of interest in your own personal feelings of like being drawn or snagged or moved by some topic or some domain um and you know if you want to follow the trajectories that I&amp;#39;m doing that&amp;#39;s all well and good but even if you wanted to you wouldn&amp;#39;t it wouldn&amp;#39;t happen that way because that&amp;#39;s not how the world Works um and so as I give this sort of lecture um my main request for you is to just not let your brain turn all the way off I&amp;#39;m going to be talking fast about a lot of sort of topics that are going to be relatively unfamiliar um for some of them they might be the first time you&amp;#39;ve heard about it for some of them you might have heard about it before uh the goal is not to have you understand everything that I&amp;#39;m saying the goal is to just expose you to it um so as I start sort of blah blah bling at you um don&amp;#39;t get too hung up on whether or not you&amp;#39;re following everything just kind of like remember the words as much as you can try to let just try to let it wash over you I promise you nonzero of it will be attaching um and then when we kind of open things back up uh you can start asking the bot asking your neighbors the questions about the parts that were the most interesting to you and the part that I have found the most gratifying about doing this type of a class is the Discovery every time empirically that when I give a lecture on a given topic and then I say to 40 students ask the bot about the parts you found most interesting typically what I see from that is 40 different conversations about 40 different topics and that&amp;#39;s really a lot of fun um so with that said let us get get into it um unfortunately I I brought I intended to bring a um like a tablet so I could like draw like stuff with colors um and I brought the tablet but then when I looked for like the the pen part I found I just thrown like this like standard pencil into here which I can&amp;#39;t even I can&amp;#39;t even imagine what was going on when I did that so we&amp;#39;re just doing we&amp;#39;re going to do it old school with unfortunately just a singular color but that&amp;#39;s okay um let&amp;#39;s see move over here so was your fault how dare you okay I&amp;#39;ll just I&amp;#39;ll put it on your bill um um um okay so right so the topic of the course is neuroscience the the department is biology and most of you as biology majors and whatnot have internalized to some degree or another with validity that biology and Neuroscience are things are is is Rel is related to things like cells and neurons and wet lab microscope types of conversations and stuff like that super valid super good topics good things to look at um and all kind of part and parcel with a particular philosophical tradition that is so fundamental to the way that we do scientific research in 2025 in Earth um that we often don&amp;#39;t even think about it and that is the concept of reductionism that&amp;#39;s not your way um so reductionism is just sort of a general philosophical approach to the study of the natural world um which tries to break things down into smaller and smaller pieces so that with you can sort of make more and more precise measurements and more more precise topics more more precise investigations but this kind of like sort of like implicit assumption that at some point there will be that by looking at the component pieces of the world you&amp;#39;ll be able to get a sense of the istic view of how everything works um and there&amp;#39;s a lot of validity to that approach but there&amp;#39;s also obviously a lot of limitations to that um because if you&amp;#39;re only looking at the small pieces in isolation you never going to see or you&amp;#39;re going to have a hard time seeing what we call emergent properties which are things that only really come about when you look at the the combination of things at a larger scale than the kind of things you can put into a test tube and under a microscope um the classic example of emergence is traffic um so traffic is a property of cars on a road um but you can never understand traffic by looking at a singular car it&amp;#39;s something that only really comes about when you&amp;#39;re looking at the cars operating in their natural environment um and so you know the the counter to reductionism is what you might call more holism or something like that um but that tends to be the scale that my sort of research domain tends to operate in is I I tend not to be like I look at the research of the people who are doing the highly reduced sort of like electrophysiology studies where they put electrodes into the brains of various animals um fmri where they have people in a tube and they&amp;#39;re looking at the magnetic resonance of their hemoglobin in their brain um but my particular domain of research tends to focus on humans behaving in natural environments doing um the kinds of stuff that we do in our sort of day-to-day lives so you know like throwing things in the air and catching them involves there&amp;#39;s a motor behavior of putting Force into the marker an information gathering phase and then another motor command which if it lines up with the world works out if it doesn&amp;#39;t I drop it um and large sort of trying to understand that behavioral process um in its natural context and then trying to use whatever the best measurements that I can come up with um of those behaviors and then trying to attach them to sort of the more low-level reductionist sort of um fields of inquiry so that we can have a sense of like you know how the things like cells and neurons can lead to complex behaviors like that so I think of it as kind of like it&amp;#39;s almost like a robotics approach so it&amp;#39;s I like to tell people that I studi the part of Neuroscience that overlaps with robotics um because robotics is another field that kind of like keeps you honest in the sense that it&amp;#39;s you make things that move around in the real world so you can&amp;#39;t really cut that many corners so the thing just stops working um and the difference is that the like robots we know how they work because we made them but we they can&amp;#39;t do all the things we want humans we don&amp;#39;t really know how they work but they can do pretty much anything so there&amp;#39;s this kind of combination of those two sort of thinking about the human as like a magical meat robot and trying to study it and understand it from the that perspective um can lead to a lot of useful results um and the nice thing about that is kind of the abstraction away from the biology and from the the the knowledge that it is in fact under the hood cells and neurons and you know membrane potentials and things like that um and thinking about it more in the terms of the things that we can measure um which we will talk about shortly um so let&amp;#39;s talk so speaking of the natural world let&amp;#39;s sort of talk about something which you know is one of the ways to parse out that General topic which is what&amp;#39;s called the perception Action Cycle um so let&amp;#39;s start by drawing a brain I&amp;#39;m trying to draw it I&amp;#39;m draw yes let&amp;#39;s do it like that um so here&amp;#39;s how you draw a brain there you go um the sorry try and you&amp;#39;ll figure it out okay so this is your brain this is a picture of your brain that&amp;#39;s your temporal lobe this is your eye you&amp;#39;re facing that way um and there&amp;#39;s a lot of details that are not being covered here but this is the general shape so here you are that&amp;#39;s your that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s you and you existence in the world and let&amp;#39;s see let&amp;#39;s do this different way there you go that&amp;#39;s you you&amp;#39;re in the world and here here&amp;#39;s your body here&amp;#39;s your eye here&amp;#39;s your mouth and then inside of there that&amp;#39;s your brain not to scale and so as you are in the world you have a very limited awareness of of your given context and the everything that that you know comes in through your senses and well your senses in your memory so let&amp;#39;s think about a particular moment in time where you&amp;#39;re sitting here you have your eye and then you see out here there&amp;#39;s a cat you like cats and so you so the image so light from the sun bounces off the cat and goes into your eye and we&amp;#39;ll talk a lot about eyes we&amp;#39;ll talk about the lens we&amp;#39;ll talk about the retina we&amp;#39;ll talk about the phobia we&amp;#39;ll talk about the optic nerve um but the most the main thing is that their your eye is the place where environmental energy is first absorbed by your nervous system and this moment right here is a very special moment in your perceptual cycle which is the moment of transduction um which is the term for the moment when some form of environmental energy in this case light has gets transduced and converted into neural activity in this particular case in your this is your eye the light goes in it goes into your retina into your phobia which talk plenty about um there&amp;#39;s a particular uh class of molecule called opsin opsins look roughly like this this like you know um what are they called carbons and hydrogens and then the hexagon and then the long the long uh sort of Wiggly tail um the people in Biochemistry this is probably familiar shapes except this is not drawn well and then you have a bunch of these opsins in your eye um and they&amp;#39;re all there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s basically three main ones and they&amp;#39;re sort of they&amp;#39;re all they they&amp;#39;re tuned if you want to use that term to different wavelengths of light and they the nature of them is that when a photon of light hits them they absorb the energy of that Photon and then change shape and I think I actually did this backwards I think they start out with the Kink and then when they absorb the light they straighten out um but whatever happens this absorption of a photon changes the electrochemical properties of the molecule and it goes from being a neutral to a plus one or a minus one or whatever it is um but the point is that the the the light that is coming from the environment bouncing off the cat entering your eye changing the chemical layout of the opson um and happening in the trillions and billions of sort of instances that biology tends to operate in um this changes the polarity and the Electrical uh state of the rods and the cones in your retina which get sort of you know accumulated with ganglia and various sort of other stuff um and leads to a shift in the uh electrical potential in the in that section of your retina that then gets sent in as spikes down your optic nerves neurons are the things that Neuroscience is made of and mostly what neurons do is they Spike they send little electrical pulses and that&amp;#39;s how they communicate that whatever that neuron has tuned to has has occurred um and for a for a for perception for vision it&amp;#39;s this absorption of light into the opson and the and the shift in this polarity and then the change in that electrical state that leads to a change in the um what&amp;#39;s the term uh the spike rate of of a given gangan cell as it is sending its axon down the optic nerve into your um optic the occipital lobe and the the visual cortex um and so we&amp;#39;re going to talk more about this in more detail and more coherence um but the important thing here is that the light that has been absorbed by your eye that is then gets converted through this strange biochemical machine into a pattern of neural activity uh because the neural activity is caused by the light and because the light has been reflected off the object in question there is a general belief and assumption um that that the pattern of neural activity has somehow has some relationship with the object in the real world there&amp;#39;s some statistical correlation there&amp;#39;s some relationship and the pattern of neural activity somehow encodes information about the world that you&amp;#39;re looking at um the nature of that relationship is tenuous and complex um and generally speaking extremely impoverished like the actual information we&amp;#39;re getting in any mo One Moment In Time is far less than you think it would be it&amp;#39;s a lot but the richness of your visual environment for example is very much an illusion based off of your brain&amp;#39;s ability to sort of Cobble together a lot of noisy information to give you something that&amp;#39;s sort of accurate enough to move through the world but often in almost exclusively designed sort of like after the fact um so that&amp;#39;s your brain again um it&amp;#39;s more like a ma brain but that&amp;#39;s fine so your optic so the light comes into your eye gets absorbed by the retina which is on the back of your eye sends a pattern of neural activity down your optic nerve um passes through some subcortical areas and the thalamus and stuff like that which we&amp;#39;ll talk not that much about that part but there is some stuff that happens here um and then projects down to the occipital lobe which is otherwise known as the visual cortex which is in the back of your brain um not super important to know where it is but it&amp;#39;s just just kind of like one of those things like it&amp;#39;s like Vision happens here for in the back for whatever reason um and so this is the place where the first kind of like the first pass of information about your visual environment sort of starts to get computed and it&amp;#39;s mostly in the form of like edges and dark patches light patches you know and stuff like that and once you get from V1 which is primary visual cortex it goes through other stages of processing that lead to sort of more and more complex you know um structures to emerge so like you start with things like edges and then if you have enough edges you can get patches and if you get patches then you can get textures and if you get textures you can get objects and that sort of like each stage of visual processing Builds on the stage before um to sort of eventually lead to the ability to do things like object recognition of like oh that thing out there is a cat there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a conversation we can have about like like the the parts of that process that go down this lobe which is your temporal lobe which is here um tends to be the sort of object space of like that&amp;#39;s a desk that&amp;#39;s a computer um and then the part that we tend to care more about in this class is the part that goes up this direction um which tends to be more in tune of using that information to plan your movement out in the world um something that I haven&amp;#39;t said I think yet but probably but is something that bear is repeating is obviously this is a cartoon this is a very abstracted simplified version of a story which if you wanted to tell the whole story you would have to tell a thousand thousand stories of a thousand thousand humans in their Labs recording data getting a bunch of numbers and then making up their own stories and the discussion sections of their own papers about what the different parts mean and then this kind of cartoonified story is the version that tends to make it into the textbooks that we T sort of communicate back to you and sort of try to make sense out of any of it but I think it&amp;#39;s really important that we remember that this is not the real story this is the cartoon and the real story is something that we don&amp;#39;t actually have access to there is no there&amp;#39;s no level like of of class where I can just give you the book that says here is what the visual cortex is actually doing the best I could ever do is just to give you a record of all the empirical measurements that all the humans who have ever investigated this man to put together and then tell you the story that we have collectively decided is the best story that we can come up with for how we think this part of this lumpy pink thing inside of all of our skulls is operating um but yeah but that&amp;#39;s not there is a gap an essential gap between epistemology which is our knowledge of things and metaphysics which is what actually exists uh and the two things never truly touch there is always going to be a difference between knowing something and what that thing actually is and in the history of science we have told many many many stories about what we think is going on in the world and in our bodies and in our goopy bits um and historically over time every single one of those stories on a long enough time scale is proven wrong in some sense everything we currently think think will eventually be proven wrong in some way or another um evidence for that being everything we&amp;#39;ve ever thought up until this point has been proven wrong in some way or another um so as you think there&amp;#39;s something special about today that&amp;#39;s going to keep happening um indefinitely until the sun burns out but the beauty of the scientific process in some sense is that we have this belief that even though everything has been wrong there is a sense that each success of idea is less wrong than the one before it and less wrong means that it allows us to make more precise predictions it allows us to heal sickness better it allows us to build machines that do more exciting things um sometimes those improvements happen by completely throwing around throwing out philosophical sort of like base level beliefs about how certain things work um but yeah it&amp;#39;s a continuous process we&amp;#39;ll talk about it um yes so so here we are in this cycle you the light has bounced off the cat it&amp;#39;s hit your eye it&amp;#39;s been absorbed it&amp;#39;s been transmitted back to your visual cortex um you have identified that it&amp;#39;s a cat and you have a an inbuilt volition that says I like to touch cats great we support this for you so this is the parietal lobe don&amp;#39;t worry about the parietal lobe it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s great but you can worry about it if you want um but the important sort of okay so this back here is your visual cortex um this on the side here roughly speaking is your motor cortex and So eventually you start as you as you look in more and more pictures of the brain you will and you can look at this directly the the the wrinkles and stuff on the brain are not random they are conserved in the same sense that while every face that we have looks very different they generally have two eyes and a nose and a mouth and just in different kind of configurations the wrinkly stuff and the the crevices and bumps and stuff on her brain roughly the same like if you were to crack open all the brains in this room which I don&amp;#39;t recommend um you would find a lot of Correspondence in where the the big um creases and stuff come in um and I am not at the level of that anatomy where I can name them off the top of my head um but I do recognize them in pictures and that&amp;#39;s how you can kind of it&amp;#39;s easy to tell when someone is drawing a brain artistically versus when they&amp;#39;re looking at Anatomy because artists and whatnot often just say oh yeah it&amp;#39;s a bunch of like pink wrinkles and then you just sort of it&amp;#39;s like okay well that&amp;#39;s not that&amp;#39;s not actually how we do but anyways there&amp;#39;s a big one right in the mirror called the central sulcus sulcus is like the crease part and on this side of that sulcus is the somato sensory cortex somat sensation is like basically touch like think that this type of sensation um and on that side is the motor cortex so the n sensory cortex and then the motor cortex and they tend to be paired and you can look up I&amp;#39;ll you we&amp;#39;ll look up the huny LI when we talk about the motor cortex um but I kind of it&amp;#39;s It&amp;#39;s I enjoy this distinction and kind of like there&amp;#39;s these two sides of the brain where on this side of the brain it&amp;#39;s kind of like sensation and sort of the the perception of the world like visual aspects and this the sort of sensory aspects and then on this side of the brain is where we start getting to like motor actions and movements and kind of the outgoing parts of things um and as we sort of keep going forward you eventually get over here to the frontal loes um the frontal lobe is like the big lumpy part in the front that&amp;#39;s the like the the the most human part of the brain all Maman brains are roughly the sort of same anatomically they&amp;#39;re just very fun mirrored into different sort of shapes and sizes like you know rats have a much more pronounced Factory bulb for smell versus their visual cortex and the human brain has a has a lot of extra Anatomy on that frontal lobe area this is thought to be kind of where decision making comes from this is where sort of like language kind of lives and often in it&amp;#39;s um referenced in uh like executive function so that the feeling of like deciding what you want to do this is also where like metacognition happens so if you&amp;#39;re having thoughts about your thoughts like oh yeah I&amp;#39;m angry right now like that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s a frontal loby area and and just reiterating the point every time I point to a part of the brain and I say this is the part that does this thing a little part of me inside is screaming and dying because none of this is how any of it that like that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the cartoon that&amp;#39;s not how the real world is set up it&amp;#39;s much more complex than that it&amp;#39;s much noisier than that but it&amp;#39;s if I say this is where executive function happens and I point at the front of the brain and then this is where Vision happens and I point at the back of the brain that statement is more true than if I switch those two things around so just it&amp;#39;s important to reiterate that even though I am telling you these simplified stories these sort of textbook level conversations about how the brain is this is the stuff that if we come back to this class in 250 years we&amp;#39;re going to be saying very very different things but we&amp;#39;ll probably still say something like the vision happens in the back and the cognition happens in the front anyways um from this frontal lobe from the you get sort of the frontal area executive functions then you get your premotor area and somewhere around here is where volitions arise volition is sort of same route as voluntary it&amp;#39;s like the things that you want to do so you see you see the the cat and you say I want to touch the cat here is the cat and look at me I&amp;#39;m touching it and that&amp;#39;s this is what I want to happen and so now you are in this state where here&amp;#39;s your body here here&amp;#39;s your hand there here&amp;#39;s this cat there and here&amp;#39;s this desire that I sure wish that my hand part was on this cat part um and this sort of and now there&amp;#39;s a a gap between the way that the world is in your perception and the way the world that wish the way that you wish the world would be which is that your hand was sort of touching this object okay so those volitions kind of meld with uh the perceptual experience and from this sort of alchemy emerges something resembling a motor plan um we&amp;#39;re going to I&amp;#39;m trying to stop myself from going to some of these details because I am going to have like like we&amp;#39;re going to have a whole lecture about the eye we&amp;#39;re going to have a whole lecture about the motor cortex we&amp;#39;re going to talk about this in more detail I&amp;#39;m just giving the overview uh but um but yeah but this is where we would call something the first time we start seeing something resembling a motor plan there&amp;#39;s a lot of times in the chats y&amp;#39;all have been having where you talk about things like muscle memory um which is the sort of muscle memory is kind of like the uh it&amp;#39;s a term we like to use it&amp;#39;s like a very standard human expression um but it&amp;#39;s also one of the things that like it doesn&amp;#39;t really exist in a physiological sense like your Mo your muscles don&amp;#39;t have memory they&amp;#39;re much simpler object which we will talk about muscles too um usually what you mean when you say muscle memory is motor plan um and as you sort of work on something more and more and you get more expertise more experience that&amp;#39;s the that that what we tend to refer to as motor as muscle memory is really like the motor plans kind of becoming more robust and more sort of locked in um and typically where a lot of that kind of motor planning takes place is not necessarily in the motor cortex um but most of that starts happening in subcortical regions um so if you think about a picture of the brain and you think about the that pink wrinkly thing in your skull that&amp;#39;s T tends to be what we think about that&amp;#39;s your cortex that&amp;#39;s the um neocortex it&amp;#39;s the part where most of the processing happens um which we&amp;#39;ll talk a little about what processing means in this context um but it is I like to I like to talk about this as like that is the it&amp;#39;s like that&amp;#39;s kind of like the the bloom of the rose on the rose bush like when you think about the nervous system and you&amp;#39;re looking at when you&amp;#39;re looking at a rose bush it makes a lot of sense that we tend to focus on the rose like the red thing with petals and that smells nice and we spend a lot of our time focusing on that part of the plant in for very good reason but if you really take a step back and look at it from a b botney point of view it&amp;#39;s mostly Bush and just a little bit of row and I think that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of the same with the way our cortex works um the majority of our central nervous system is not in that cortex it&amp;#39;s in the subcortical regions and among my favorite of those subcortical regions is the cerebellum which it look sort of sits at this looks kind of like this fist shaped thing that sits right below your cortex when you look up pictures of the brain online you&amp;#39;ll see the big pink wrinkly thing you see this kind of more dense sort of like grayish looking thing underneath it um that&amp;#39;s your cerebellum your cerebellum is a very complicated Beast um it contains about 3.5 times as many neurons as the rest of your central nervous system combined um and that number is sort of strangely conserved across different animals like all animals mammals particular just because I don&amp;#39;t know about the other guys um we all have cortex we all have cerebellum we have very different brain to body ratios and different sort of proportions there but in General however big your brain is whatever animal you are your cerebellum is has three and a half times as many neurons as the rest of your cortex um which is one of those things like I I always sort of come back to that it&amp;#39;s sort of like that just seems anytime you find a number in nature that&amp;#39;s conserved across a bunch of different stases it&amp;#39;s just kind of like that seems like an interesting thing I wish I knew more about it um so your cerebellum the part of the reason why has so many more like neurons by by count is that the neurons in associated with it are teensy teensy tiny they are you have granual cells and you have pingi cells um which I W I&amp;#39;m going to look up pictures this because ah uh Peri cells oh do I have internet here yeah yeah preni cells in your cerebellum are like one of the more beautiful parts of the nervous of your of your brain it&amp;#39;s kind of you have the cell body you have the axon and then these are all the synapses and all of there&amp;#39;s thousands upon thousands of them um this picture is famous this was actually taken by not picture but it&amp;#39;s um this is from pinji the guy who sort of like he he created was it oh sorry kahal uh says right there um Ramon kahal who yeah um was part of the sort of group that came up with the staining mechanisms that allowed us to sort of start looking at neurons in their isolation that happened in roughly 1909 before that we didn&amp;#39;t really know what neurons were and didn&amp;#39;t know if they were just one big mass or if they were individualized pieces and there was like a big scientific and philosophical debate about are neur is is the brain all one big connected piece or did the like do the do the neurons touch or are they separated from each other and there was Ramon Cal who was arguing in the favor of the synapse Doctrine which said that there was a gap between them and then there I think it was GOI who was arguing in favor of their it&amp;#39;s all touching whatever that was called and then um GOI came up with like a silver nitrate staining process that allowed them to make images like this of looking at cells and ironically by making that staining process prove the Cal side of that argument correct and that they tend not to touch and then they both got both Ramon Cal and GOI got they shared a Nobel Prize but apparently they had such bad blood between them that they both spent their entire speech bashing the other guy um so there you go there you got that um but yeah so your so your cerebellum is consists of preni cells and then granu cells which in comparison look more like this they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re small and they don&amp;#39;t have these super long fibers that sort of go very long distances they&amp;#39;re much more localized they only connect to their immediate neighbors um and the majority of ner of of neurons in your nervous system are these granular cells that live in your cerebellum your cerebellum is a layered thing um like most parts of your brain it&amp;#39;s got kind of like um like the layers tend to operate phog gentically so that on the outside is the newest stuff on the inside is the older stuff um sellum has that structure we may talk about it I&amp;#39;m not sure uh we&amp;#39;ll see it&amp;#39;s one of those things like if enough people talk to the bot and ask about this then I might like I&amp;#39;ll be I&amp;#39;ll be trying to steer the lectures based off the interest of the class um but anyway we&amp;#39;re talking about cats um so light hit the cat hit your eye absorbed in your retina tweaked your opsins triggered a neural Cascade vibrated your visual cortex uh gave you the perception of a cat your volitional desire to touch the cat combined with the knowledge that there&amp;#39;s a cat in front of you and started creating a motor plan which sort of you know this is where the cartoon gets really cartoony because it&amp;#39;s like there&amp;#39;s a lot of controversy about like the different steps of this process but long story short something in the com combination of your motor cortex and your cerebellum which is your cerebellum is largely like a motor based thing like a movement it mostly deals with movement of your body um it&amp;#39;s thought to be related to like tool use um so this this thing that we humans can do where we pick up an object and kind of pretty quickly learn the physics of it um and using it as a tool that has certain sort of characteristics is thought to be like a neoc thing the Neo is the new part it&amp;#39;s on the outside it&amp;#39;s complicated um but there&amp;#39;s a level there&amp;#39;s a hierarchical nature of your motor system where at the at the higher levels where the top is pretty much like the frontal lobe the the the plans are much more abstract so it&amp;#39;s things like I&amp;#39;m thirsty um I want I wish I was drinking water right now uh and then in order for that high level volition to be turned into something that can actually sort of lead me to my goal there has to be this sort of like um pairing down of specificity from that very high level volition uh down to something which at some level is going to have to boil down to muscle fir rings to move my body through space and so as I say oh I wish I had water I see that there&amp;#39;s water over there and somehow that volition is converted into motor commands that move my legs so now my body is in a place that I can move my arm I know how this thing works so I open the thing and I get to drink water um and so that process tends to go you know from the motor cortex then you got the cerebellum then your cerebellum sort of has connections to your brain stem I say connections but they&amp;#39;re really kind of like they&amp;#39;re wrapped around each other um so you have your brain stem your medulla oblongata your ponds um that&amp;#39;s the part of your brain people talk about your Reptilian Brain that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that part that&amp;#39;s the part that handles things like is my heart beating am I breathing is my temperature within a livable range that tends to be hanging out and controlled at your brain stem um and your brain stem is the start of your spinal cord which is another good friend there we go there you go there you perfect nice still you good job um and so your spinal cord is a part of your central nervous system often times when we think about the spinal cord it&amp;#39;s often kind of it&amp;#39;s It&amp;#39;s given a bad W and we tend even when we look at pictures of like if you Google pictures of the central nervous system you&amp;#39;ll often see pictures that stop here and it&amp;#39;s just sort of like you know cortico centrism sort of just focused on that that rose on the bush and then less to say about you the cerebellum often gets in the picture but we often like cut off where the spine is um but your spine is just as much a part of your nervous system as the rest of it and the specifically the way that we&amp;#39;re going to Define central nervous system as opposed to peripheral nervous system is uh Loosely that the central nervous system is where processing happens um where processing is a very goopy term um that basically means like information is coming in being some sort of conversion is happening which we might call a computation if we wanted to use like a computer analogy um but it information comes in changes form in some way and then information goes out um and the and you&amp;#39;re and the the spine is doing that kind of of processing um at various levels which we will also talk about let me see how we are on time okay on time um but it&amp;#39;s in very find it kind of fascinating ways and there are some stories that we will talk about later in the semester of studies that we aren&amp;#39;t allowed to do anymore um on cats where you can sever the spine like like cut the spine so it no longer connects to the upper part of the brain um and the cat can still do things like walk um because the spine is is housing the the gray matter that that does that handles things like Central pattern generation and reflex responses um or something like a central pattern generator is a thing that handles like the basic rhythmic motion of my legs and the thing that says oh well one foot is going to be in stance and the other one&amp;#39;s going to be in swing and then they&amp;#39;re going to sort of swap off um and a lot of that processing is handled in the spine itself um your spine goes down your spinal cord ends actually around here like right below your thoracic spine I know right um and then the stuff below that is what&amp;#39;s called like the cotus aquinus which is like that&amp;#39;s where it does become more um extension Cordy like and you you start to lose the gray matter and you get the more just like the peripheral nerves that go out to your limbs um yeah the yeah so the peripheral so I also just want to just again make that point that that distinction between central nervous system and peripheral nervous system is the kind of thing that is often stated as like this is a hard delineation um but there&amp;#39;s a lot of gray area there one of the most classic gray areas is the retina um the retina has a lot of neurons on the back of it and there&amp;#39;s layers to it and it&amp;#39;s often described like we think about the retina like the eye sort of like the classical sensory organ um but there&amp;#39;s stuff happening on the back of the retina before anything even leaves on on that optic nerve pass to the brain that really could be considered to be computation um similarly your skin has a lot of connections in it that you know might be doing things that we might consider computation um that&amp;#39;s why like when you get hurt if you like rub rub the thing it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt as much because the ACT the activity of activating sensory organs around the damaged area suppresses the feeling coming from the damaged area and that is all happening at the level of your skin um so just again this this these these names and terms and whatnot this is not like nature is not design divided into pieces with departments and names that&amp;#39;s a thing that we humans did to Nature so that we could have any hope of making any sense of it but anytime we put a name or a label or or a category into nature we&amp;#39;re always going to be making concessions and sort of we&amp;#39;re drawing lines around areas because it allows us to have better conversations about those things but there&amp;#39;s always going to be gray areas and often times it&amp;#39;s those gray areas or the cracks that the that tend to lead us to abandon certain thoughts and go towards others um okay so speaking of the peripheral nervous system um so where I wish had colors uh there you go okay this is your arm that&amp;#39;s these are your bones and your bones are mostly what you are like if we&amp;#39;re thinking about it in terms of like the space that you inhabit like the shape that you are your general sort of ability to move through the world it&amp;#39;s mostly bones um and then all the goop that&amp;#39;s associated with that is sort of the details but the General cookie cutter shape of you as a as a creature is driven by these weird sticks and these weird sticks have weird things attached to them called muscles um and yeah and So eventually one of the things that happens when you thinking about the sort of like more holistic picture of the world and sort of the way that you live in it um is be if you&amp;#39;re in a lab if you&amp;#39;re if you&amp;#39;re living this reductionist life where you&amp;#39;re choosing a particular domain of inquiry um and you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re sort of simplifying and cutting out any extraneous factors that get in your way to to sort of zoom in as far as you can on that particular thing um you get to remove all the parts of the question that you don&amp;#39;t want to look at and so if you&amp;#39;re a neuroscientist you might have you might take the mouse or the rat or the fruit fly or whoever you want to look at into the lab and then just like remove all the parts that you that aren&amp;#39;t Neuroscience so that you can have a better picture of the neurons that you care about when you want to think about when you don&amp;#39;t have that capacity and you want to think about things more generally um you don&amp;#39;t have that um that luxury and so if you want to think about how humans move through the world um and even if you care mostly about the neural aspects of it even if you care mostly about the perceptual aspects of that you are sort of required by the nature of reality to consider things like bones and muscles even though those are not particularly neural objects um because when we move when when our all this weird neural FL flam is eventually going to have to transmit down into something that moves the body through the world and this is where we get to the kind of the robotics y conversation because um this is the part where the neural activity which has been originally transduced into this sensory experience of of vision um all of that sort of combination of things is eventually going to get boiled down here to something that sort of flips that coin around and now the neural activity is going to be converted into environmental energy in this case in the form of mechanical energy so it&amp;#39;s going to squeeze my muscle and my arm is going to move that muscle my arm is going to be move and this is now has there&amp;#39;s an there&amp;#39;s literal like energy in this movement specifically in the form of kinetic energy or you know you know if I&amp;#39;m pulling on a spring or something like that might be mechanical energy like potential energy kinetic energy spring energy that&amp;#39;s the stuff that we get from our muscles and so there&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the whole perception action cycle is this conversion of environmental energy into perceptual neural activity down back into a motor action and so your muscles are weird objects um and a muscle is effectively a variable stiffness spring that&amp;#39;s pretty much what a muscle is muscles only pull your muscle can only pull on things muscles cannot push if when I when it looks like I&amp;#39;m pushing it&amp;#39;s because this muscle is pulling on the tip of that bone so that my arm goes that way and that that&amp;#39;s called extension and then if I want to squeeze this one then I send a motor command down there it fires the motor tendon Union GGI body organs and it says Hey surrounding muscle tissue contract and so this what was originally a fairly Wiggly Soft Spring gets electrified and becomes a rather stiff spring and pulls this joint up and this one there&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re paired there&amp;#39;s a flexion uh muscle group and then there&amp;#39;s the extension muscle group and those two things operate in conjunction to to move this degree of freedom and that type of so yeah and so that so the motor plan that comes down from the motor cortex and sort of through the cerebellum if you&amp;#39;re a fancy type of an animal like a human it goes through the corticos spinal tract which goes there is a sort of connection straight from your motor cortex down to your spine bypassing things like your cerebellum all animals have a cortical spinal tract but it&amp;#39;s really um but not to equal degree um and that&amp;#39;s one of the interesting distinctions in the animal kingdom is like this is a fun this is one of my favorite I actually use this question to test like AI models to see how it does at Neuroscience is asking about the cortical spinal tract and how it varies across the animal kingdom because that&amp;#39;s one of the places where the questions get really subtle um and so I can look at how it does at that answer to see like I&amp;#39;m looking at like a local model I can run on my computer like the small ones I I can watch it get the subtle Parts wrong when I ask it that kind of a question so but a lot of stuff I&amp;#39;ve been talking about about how like motor cortex motor commands go through like the cerebellum and the brain stem and stuff like that that is true um but there is also this cortico spinal tract anytime you see one of those big words with an o in the middle just replace the o with a slash so cortico spinal is C cortex SL spinal that just basically go straight from the cortex down to the spine bypassing all the subcortical regions um and it&amp;#39;s what allows us to be to control our individual degrees of freedom of our body directly um as opposed to doing things in like it&amp;#39;s more synergistic way which is way deeper than I want to talk about in this particular lecture cheing that clock it&amp;#39;s killing me um so yeah so here I am I&amp;#39;m so close I&amp;#39;m so ready to almost touch this cat um and I my motor my motor plan which has come down from on high down this sort of hierarchical structure of our motor system has uh taken my awareness of the world and my own body so the vision gives me information about remote parts of the world things I can not touch things that are outside of mine here&amp;#39;s a great word peripersonal space the per personal space is the area that I can touch with my hands um outside of that is a different part of the world that&amp;#39;s kind of happening in the parietal Lo one of my favorite studies is this like they got a monkey Myck monkey and they trained it to grab things on a desk um and then they gave gave it a a temporary lesion so they just like squirt something into the part of the brain that handles that peripersonal perception so that that part of the brain kind of goes offline um and you get what&amp;#39;s called cortical blindness so the monkey sort of loses its ability to to see things cartoon cartoon um in that per personal Zone then they took the monkeys and they train it to use a grabber arm like a little like like claw arm so it now its reach is now farther because it can use this arm and when they ask after they teach it how to use it and they sort of leion that per personal Zone the blind spot increases to include the region that could be reached with the Grabber in addition to the hand um so put that into your worldview and see how it fits um so anyways um here I am I see this cat and I have this awareness of my body a lot of this is sort of call kind of associate that with um proprioception um so like as my arm is out here it is uh putting force on my joints because of the weight of the arm and my body can encode and is aware of those forces and I can use that to kind of be aware of where my arm is I can also see my arm I also have a memory of lifting it up there&amp;#39;s a lot of ways that we know where our bodies are um but I know that it&amp;#39;s here and that if I can make this part move that way um then I&amp;#39;ll have I will have achieved my my my deepest desire of touching this cat um and so there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot of comp complicated stuff about the like we don&amp;#39;t move our body one joint at a time we move it in the sort of like barely sophisticated dance um and a lot of that the breakdown and how we sort of how we choose to to to break down a complex movement across the available joints in the context of the world that&amp;#39;s a a cerebellum thing again cartoons um but let&amp;#39;s pretend like it&amp;#39;s not and so I I relax what is it so I I relax the flexor I tighten the extensor and that puts a torque on this bone which moves my hand here and now I have the reward of cat Sensations under my hand and I have now achieved this this goal of mine um right and so now and now we have and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the loop so that&amp;#39;s one path through that perception action Loop because now that the information has gone in been processed been sort of whatever and now that I have moved my body I have now changed the state of the world like my body is in the world so now as I&amp;#39;m perceiving the situation as it stands I&amp;#39;m perceiving something different and now I&amp;#39;m going to go back through that Loop and so of you know you perceive you act and then you take in the information and you kind of like that Loop is tends to be where you live your whole life um and so yeah and so this is kind of the cartoon overview of of the story as it as it holds um I will name some of the uh the fields associated with the things that we talked about um yeah uh generally speaking when we talk about well talking about like the physiology of the eyeball tends to be kind of like optology I guess um uh but that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s more like lens and pupil and like the the goopy Parts um once you&amp;#39;re talking about like the the neural the neural activity aspect of it we tend to call that like visual like visual Neuroscience perceptual Neuroscience because we are such Vision heavy animals as humans often when you hear perceptual we tend to mean visual um but strictly speaking it&amp;#39;s all like anything sensory is perceptual um when we start talking about the parts of the Neuroscience that are moving your body we tend to call that motor Neuroscience you will often hear people talk about perceptual motor Neuroscience which again perceptual motor is the same perceptual SL motor and it&amp;#39;s kind of like it&amp;#39;s this connection and this kind of like this reality that the two parts are um perception in action and perception in motor control they&amp;#39;re sort of intimately linked um oh I should mention this too um in your peripheral nervous system you have peripheral neurons and your peripheral neurons come in two types there is perceptual and there&amp;#39;s motor shockingly and that distinction is is defined by basically which direction the information is Flowing so a motor command goes out from your central nervous system towards your periphery carrying a motor command so this this is a a neuron that&amp;#39;s connected to a you know motor unit in my muscle and if it gets sort of tapped by one of these higher level structures it&amp;#39;s going to get spikes that are telling it to Fire and that will contract the muscle um once I touch the cat what was the object of my plans um there are the the the the the the neurons connected to like the sensory um organs in my hand start firing differently and they send information back down your sensory peripheral nerves peripheral sensory nerves yeah so in your periphery it is just it&amp;#39;s out outward stuff is your motor neurons um inward stuff is your Sensory neurons and that&amp;#39;s kind of the main distinction there um again uh just the word cartoons going on there yeah why are you aware what&amp;#39;s that why you not like aware why are you not aware yeah this is one of I think the most troubling realities of being alive is that and this is also part of the the standard um existential crisis that classes like this tends to give to people so have fun with that um we have a very very thin awareness of what is going on under the hood in our bodies and we have we have some awareness we have some conscious experience of like I&amp;#39;m going to reach out and grab this thing I&amp;#39;m going to oh yeah this feels cool in my hand this feels hard in my hand um but the more you learn about neuroscience and the more you learn about what&amp;#39;s going on in the Hood the more you realize that those sensory that like the cognitive like the the conscious personal experience of having a motor experience um is a really really thin layer on top of a lot of complexity that&amp;#39;s going on and that is unfortunately just like the situation that we are in um remember one time I was in grad school and we were in like a a parking lot my friends and winter waiting to go on a hike or something like that and for some reason this really stuck with me but there was just like a puddle of like dirty water in the middle of the parking lot that had this like really beautiful like oil sheen on top of it and it was just like the sort of fractal iridescent colors just and by the nature of oil it&amp;#39;s just like one molecule thick that is giving this really beautiful like vibrant colorful shape on top of just cold dark murky water and I think about that a lot when I think about the nervous system because it just feels like that is kind of our experience of living in a body is we have this experience that is sort of riding on top of this really deep and complex biological neural complex system and the that conscious Sheen is related to the depths of what&amp;#39;s going on there but we don&amp;#39;t really tend to have access to it like I can&amp;#39;t feel my stomach deciding when it wants to squirt out more enzymes to digest my food and I can&amp;#39;t tell the difference between you know parts of this thing happening and you know like it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s not really available to me there are once you start learning about the about the bits and pieces you can start kind of mapping on your your conscious experiences to the things that I&amp;#39;m going to be telling you is maybe happening under the hood um one of the ones that&amp;#39;s coming to me right now for whatever reason is like it&amp;#39;s kind of a thing that is known where when when when a person starts lifting weights for the first time if you&amp;#39;ve never been a weightlifting person there&amp;#39;s a a thing that happens where you very quickly like you&amp;#39;ll shoot up the amount of weight that you can lift in a very short amount of time because your body is learning how to fire all of your motor units at once and that&amp;#39;s just the thing that in your general life you just tend not to do and you kind of have to learn how to do that like how to extend like maximal effort and that is something that&amp;#39;s happening at the level of like recruitment of motor units and so if you then if you now go to the gym and you start having that experience you sort of feel oh yeah I&amp;#39;m getting super strong and it&amp;#39;s just kind of like you can map that experience onto this thing I just said about how your motor units work but it&amp;#39;s in but that mapping is in the this like weird cognitive space like it&amp;#39;s not at that level of like deep awareness but then you have to ask like what what would that even look like if it was yeah so over time when you&amp;#39;re like lifting weight why do you hit a because eventually you you&amp;#39;re recruiting all of your motor units and then you just don&amp;#39;t have enough muscle to produce the force so that&amp;#39;s the that beginner spike in performance is you&amp;#39;re not actually growing muscle mass in that period of time you&amp;#39;re just learning how to actually like use all the muscles that you have and then you hit that plateau and it&amp;#39;s like okay well now I&amp;#39;m using I&amp;#39;m firing 100% of my muscle abilities just my muscles aren&amp;#39;t strong enough to actually move my body so and a lot of those sort of plateaus in performance can be sort of tied back to sort of physiological structures that change and like the time courses of of improvement happen that you know like growing more muscle takes time whereas learning how to fire motor units also takes time but not in the same way so a lot of dep there um that area that I was just so speaking of naming I never I&amp;#39;ve never been able to finish a leure before the end of class um that thing were just that little area is kind of often in the area we would call neuromechanics neuromechanics is a relatively new newly named field I would be curious to see if it&amp;#39;s in that mesh uh terminology thing we learned about last time um but neuromechanics neural mechanics um is kind of like at that boundary of neural activity and like and like physics like mechanics um stuff uh so that thing of like firing a motor unit to create a spring force that moves the limb that&amp;#39;s a neuromechanical question um and then like how that connects to like the spinal Central pattern generators you know that&amp;#39;s where it starts to get like is that still neuromechanics is that you know these are murky areas um on the other side of neuromechanics you have biomechanics biomechanics is literally Newton&amp;#39;s Laws as it applies to meat um and we will be talking about that uh to some level of specificity um the not too distant future um let&amp;#39;s see yeah let me let me finish this up and we&amp;#39;ll talk about that um yeah so biome mechanics is related to like just the physics of moving your body um we&amp;#39;re particularly going to talk about descriptions of the body that are that basically remove any conception of biology from them and just thinking about the human as an object that weighs a lot and is balanced on a pretty narrow uh platform and that&amp;#39;s sort of center of mass base of support level of uh description of the human body which we will talk about in some detail pretty soon um another thing I haven&amp;#39;t mentioned but we will talk about to is evolution because all of these systems are evolved systems they all they developed over billions of years um to the form that they currently are and in the same sense of things you can describe the system as it stands right now but you&amp;#39;re always going to be missing some of the story if you don&amp;#39;t think about it in the context of how it emerged um and so I haven&amp;#39;t quite figured out a lot of the things I&amp;#39;m talking about are the things that are going to go into these sort of numbered lectures once I sort of figure out how I want to chop things up um there&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m going to be extracting a lot of things from what your conversations are to figure out how to steer that those lectures um there&amp;#39;s some hit points that I&amp;#39;m going to hit no matter what you guys want to do um and evolution is going to be one of those things and specifically for us um it&amp;#39;s going to I&amp;#39;m going to be well I guess talk a little about the evolution of your eye but um I think a lot of my particular interest is in the thing that is often yeah evolution of your your skeleton um like why our skeletons are the particular weird shape that they are how we sort of developed from our Origins as fish that turn into lizards that turn into squirrels that turn into monkeys that turn into Apes that turn into us um because it matters a lot um evolution of our eye is another odd story uh the our retina is backwards in some pretty interesting ways like it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s like flipped in the direction that you would expect it to be like you would expect that the light sensing aspects of it will be facing towards the light but they&amp;#39;re actually backwards they face back and they kind of have to bounce through and this is thought to be related to like when we crawled out of the ocean and our eyes kind of inverted to allow the same kind of refraction to happen um yeah so uh we didn&amp;#39;t talk in this particular story about eye movements eye movements we will talk about also in some detail um I we have we humans have very mobile eyes that&amp;#39;s a very Cornerstone aspect of our visual system is that our eyes move a lot um it is part of the motor system to be able to move any part of your body including the eyes and that specific area is called ocul motor control oculo eye motor movement oculo motor is sort of stuff related to eye movements um and so things like ocul motor control is obviously very overlapping with things like visual perception and perceptual Neuroscience because as we move our eyes the information on the retina changes and we have to make and we make decisions about where to move our eyes in the same way we make decisions about where to move our our arms but this is also a place that like as like we you can live a whole happy life and like never really think about your eye movements but once you start thinking about your eye movements you&amp;#39;ll realize that it&amp;#39;s I think about it a lot like it&amp;#39;s it feels a lot like breathing to me where usually your breathing is something that just happens on its own but you can control it to some EXT like I can hold my breath I can take a breath I can do that I have volitional control over my breathing in a way that I don&amp;#39;t over my heart um and our eye movements are kind of like that as well like I can choose to look one place or another um I can choose not to look at something um but for the most part for 99.9% of my Waking Life my eyes are just kind of doing what they do um and being driven by a combination of a ailable visual information and my desires of the world and sometimes like if I throw something in the air I will look at it and then catch it and there&amp;#39;s a lot of that process that is happening just below that level of conscious awareness um and that I think is a nice enough segue into we&amp;#39;re going to talk about for the last 10 minutes which is methods methodologies um methods is kind of a it&amp;#39;s just just the term that we use for like how in God&amp;#39;s name are you going to study any of this that&amp;#39;s kind of what methods means and generally speaking when we talk about methods we&amp;#39;re talking about um equipment and and ways that we can do empirical measurements of the world that will give us information about parts of the world that we think might we might be able to glean some insight into these deeper weirder aspects of the this is another great term desiderata of our investigation desiderata means that which is desired um and it is a sort of philosophy of science term about what are you trying to figure out you came into this room as a scientist because you have a certain there&amp;#39;s something you want to know more about there&amp;#39;s some part of the world that you want to gain insight into what is that thing and how how can you do it given all the limitations and straints and sort of difficulties of like how the world is um for me in for me in my sort of domain of inquiry um I I use two primary uh research tools map which is sort for motion capture um which is the thing if you see like behind the scenes stuff in movies and video games like the suit with the dots and stuff like that that&amp;#39;s motion capture and that&amp;#39;s basically related to um moving the body like sort of recording the movement of the body um in space and I will be at one of the lab sections I will be showing um I&amp;#39;ll be bringing in some cameras and doing a freeo cap recording which is the open source software that I&amp;#39;ve been building um which is designed to like help um record the body with a high degree of fidelity um like this specific three-dimensional configuration of the body at any given moment in time because you know I would love to be able to study all the Bing activity of the pingi cells and the cerebellum but that&amp;#39;s not available to me in this year of Our Lord 2025 um I can&amp;#39;t actually get that measurement and the methods that I could use even if we if we if we could get that from something like fmri which is like the tube that you get the sort of colorful pictures of the brain um in this current moment in technology I can&amp;#39;t use that type of a tool and also have a person out in the world throwing and catching and doing stuff like that um and so we use motion capture as a methodology to record the 3D configuration of the body over time then we use those movements to try to infer while if the if the arm did this and gravity is like that then the muscles must have done this or that in order to produce the forces that generated that movement and then you kind of backtrack from well if the mo if the muscles did this then the spine must have done that and sort of you can use this kind of like this observable aspect of reality which is like the location of the arm measure it to the level of fidelity that you can with the available technology that you have and then use those empirical measurements to try to infer all this weird goopy nonsense of what I&amp;#39;ve been talking about about this part of the brain that part of the brain that part of the brain um the other technology that I tend to use a lot is I can draw on this board ey tracking which everybody loves eye tracking um it&amp;#39;s always a crowd favorite um but that&amp;#39;s another sort of like there&amp;#39;s different tools to use it but mostly these days we use video- based eye trackers which is literally just little cameras pointed at the eye and it&amp;#39;s kind of a a convenient thing that we are as humans um have these highly mobile eyes um that sort of wind up giving this really interesting readout of what my brain wanted to get more information about at each moment in time so if you give me a task like walking over rough terrain or sort of juggling or throwing and catching or something like that um you can look at the movement of my eye and at the very least know the visual information that was available to me in that moment by doing sort of 3D modeling and sort of saying okay the eye moved this way and then this the object was over here and so you know you know based on what I know about the eye I couldn&amp;#39;t see it then or I could see it in my periphery um and then I chose to make a movement that would align my eye so now it&amp;#39;s in my phobia and so you can use just like a camera pointed at the eye to tell the information that was being transmitted into my visual cortex and sort of going down that way which both gives you the information that I had available and more importantly arguably the place that my eyes move to tells me the place that my central nervous system decided I want more information from this part of the world and because those eye movements tend to happen really really fast like you know 150 milliseconds per eye movement if you&amp;#39;re doing a difficult task um like well below the level of conscious awareness we can tell stories about what we were doing after the fact but in the moment the eyes just kind of go where they need to go um and so I can tell both what information was available to this weird magical meat robot at any moment in time and I can also look at the decisions that were made of oh I&amp;#39;m going to move my eyes this way and not that way until where my central nervous system desired more information from in the world at any moment in time and so in the by the combination of these things of being able to measure the sort of the perceptual input in the form of eye tracking and the motor output in the form of motion capture um Wei this is my general attempt is to my my general approach to scientific research is to try to combine these two methodologies to give a sense of like get a picture of what&amp;#39;s h of what a given of a what a human is doing in the world as they sort of perform complex actions and then use that weird pile of data that pours out of those machines to give some insight into this stuff often in my particular case in the sort of conversation of science um I I this domain this typ type of research tends to give ecologically valid like like realist like it&amp;#39;s real data of real people doing real stuff but the Fidelity is just limited like there&amp;#39;s only the the accuracy and precision of information that I can provide with these methods is just very very limited relative to someone who&amp;#39;s in a lab pulling out individual neurons and sort of doing all the reductionist work that they can do to get really precise numbers so the so the the sociology of Sciences people like me doing the broad scoke type of research work with people who to the more careful reduction of stuff and ideally we kind of we both work together so that we can tell more complete stories and tell more satisfying cartoon stories of what&amp;#39;s going on for humans to new generations of undergrads every every year or two okay get all that covered no more questions Neuroscience nailed it great cool well actually that&amp;#39;s it as there any um any we do have like three more minutes does anyone have any questions or what&amp;#39;s the word emotional outbursts uh exential crises uh things I wish you wish I&amp;#39;d said more about no one would say anything in this moment in class I appreciate oh you do like the phon thing about the yeah yeah opson opson is that&amp;#39;s the term Ops i n reminded me of like yeah yeah it&amp;#39;s the same I mean plants don&amp;#39;t really have the motor aspect but yeah that&amp;#39;s for the biochemistry people I think it&amp;#39;s the opson is the part that has the more there&amp;#39;s a lot of lot of depth there there&amp;#39;s only it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s like a class of chemical and so you can you can look at that okay um great thank you for showing up um keep an eye on the Discord server Discord server and canvas I&amp;#39;ll make an announcement about the actual assignments going on um and uh yeah see you on m not an assignment to this what&amp;#39;s that so no assign this Sunday no not this Sunday and then I guess Monday is a holiday so I&amp;#39;ll see you in a week yeah someone here told me that which I was it you somebody told me someone told me that there was a holiday yeah thank you appreciate that I probably would have figured it out I didn&amp;#39;t have either one of them yeah I think it was just those two yeah exactly H okay",

A bot-mediated conversation will assist in paper selection and understanding methodologies.</li>\n<li><strong>Philosophical Approaches</strong>: The lecture discusses reductionism, which breaks down complex systems into smaller parts for study, and holism, which looks at systems as a whole to understand emergent properties.</li>\n<li><strong>Perception-Action Cycle</strong>: This cycle involves the conversion of environmental energy into neural activity and back into motor actions. It starts with sensory input, such as light entering the eye, and ends with motor output, like moving a hand to touch an object.</li>\n<li><strong>Visual Processing</strong>: Light is transduced into neural signals in the retina, processed in the visual cortex, and interpreted as objects. The brain&#39;s visual processing involves multiple stages, from detecting edges to recognizing objects.</li>\n<li><strong>Motor Cortex and Movement</strong>: The motor cortex, along with the cerebellum and spinal cord, plans and executes movements. The cerebellum, with its high neuron count, plays a crucial role in motor control and coordination.</li>\n<li><strong>Spinal Cord and Central Nervous System</strong>: The spinal cord is part of the central nervous system, handling reflexes and basic movement patterns. It works in conjunction with the brain to process sensory input and generate motor output.</li>\n<li><strong>Muscles and Movement Mechanics</strong>: Muscles act as variable stiffness springs, converting neural commands into mechanical energy to move the body. The interaction between neural activity and muscle mechanics is a key focus of neuromechanics.</li>\n<li><strong>Eye Movements and Visual Perception</strong>: Eye movements are controlled by the oculomotor system and are crucial for visual perception. Eye tracking is used to study where and how the brain seeks visual information.</li>\n<li><strong>Research Methods</strong>: Motion capture and eye tracking are primary methods used to study human movement and perception. These tools provide data on body configuration and eye movements, offering insights into perceptual-motor processes.</li>\n<li><strong>Educational Philosophy</strong>: The lecture emphasizes personalized learning and the use of AI tools to tailor education to individual interests, encouraging students to explore topics that resonate with them.</li>\n</ul>\n</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>"
