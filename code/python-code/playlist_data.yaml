    text: okay all
  - dur: '6.079'

    start: '45.32'
    text: the the I guess like the bi the hardcore
  - dur: '4'
    start: '48.199'
    text: biomechanics stuff like to I&amp;#39;ve almost
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '50.64'
    text: said like the motor control stuff but I
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '52.199'
    text: probably will get back to it um but
  - dur: '7.32'
    start: '55.16'
    text: we&amp;#39;re going to take a little bit of time
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '58.039'
    text: this week uh talking about just like
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '62.48'
    text: we&amp;#39;re g like today we&amp;#39;re going to go
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '63.559'
    text: through some examples of papers like
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '65.64'
    text: direct like published papers something
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '68.159'
    text: that i&amp;#39; really like so of have some
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '69.92'
    text: experience sort of going through a
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '72.2'
    text: published article and sort of try to
  - dur: '5'
    start: '73.88'
    text: make sense of that um and then on
  - dur: '3.759'
    start: '76.72'
    text: Wednesday we&amp;#39;ll do kind of like the like
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '78.88'
    text: a sort of a small group kind of
  - dur: '7.64'
    start: '80.479'
    text: assignment to help you all prepare for
  - dur: '7.401'
    start: '84.159'
    text: the sort of exam like assignment SL
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '88.119'
    text: poster proposal too that we&amp;#39;ll be do
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '91.56'
    text: probably they&amp;#39;ll both be kind of like
  - dur: '8.36'
    start: '93.36'
    text: connected to each other and be du at the
  - dur: '8.04'
    start: '96.439'
    text: end of that&amp;#39;s this week um
  - dur: '6.92'

    text: right next week
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '104.479'
    text: um so yeah that&amp;#39;s I got these wrong I&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '108.64'
    text: fix that later
  - dur: '6.241'
    start: '111.119'
    text: um the so basically the idea is like you
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '115.24'
    text: know at this point I&amp;#39;ve talked about
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '117.36'
    text: some of the kind of the topic area stuff
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '119.28'
    text: usually in the riew and then we spend a
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '120.96'
    text: good amount of time recording some data
  - dur: '3.08'
    start: '123.079'
    text: in class and kind of just like
  - dur: '2.84'
    start: '124.68'
    text: eyeballing it like looking through it
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '126.159'
    text: and sort of trying to figure out what
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '127.52'
    text: kind of stories could be told there we
  - dur: '6.601'
    start: '129.479'
    text: came in with some sort of basic
  - dur: '8.439'
    start: '131.44'
    text: hypotheses and things like that um and
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '136.08'
    text: so uh what I want the kind of this sort
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '139.879'
    text: of Next twoe Period to be which you know
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '142.2'
    text: next Monday is a holiday so it&amp;#39;ll be
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '145.519'
    text: next three classes is to prepare yall to
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '148.72'
    text: kind of start thinking about your own
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '150.72'
    text: chosen topic whatever that happens to
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '152.68'
    text: have been um using the kind of like
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '155.28'
    text: thought processes and mental Frameworks
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '157.36'
    text: and stuff like that that I&amp;#39;ve been
  - dur: '6.8'
    start: '158.84'
    text: talking about in the context of human
  - dur: '7.719'
    start: '162.44'
    text: body human movement research uh based
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '165.64'
    text: off of kinematic motion capture data um
  - dur: '2.961'
    start: '170.159'
    text: so what that&amp;#39;s going to look like is you
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '171.519'
    text: know sort of figuring out what the topic
  - dur: '4.759'
    start: '173.12'
    text: area you&amp;#39;ve chosen is um you&amp;#39;ve already
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '175.56'
    text: done that to some extent um but sort of
  - dur: '3.241'
    start: '177.879'
    text: just you know digging into that a little
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '179.04'
    text: bit more and then starting to think
  - dur: '7.28'
    start: '181.12'
    text: about uh the methodologies that are used
  - dur: '6.319'
    start: '184.28'
    text: to pursue your your topic of interest um
  - dur: '3.199'
    start: '188.4'
    text: I know that sort of the way that we
  - dur: '2.56'
    start: '190.599'
    text: gathered that it was sort of a
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '191.599'
    text: combination of talking about topics and
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '193.159'
    text: also picking a paper and the paper part
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '195.2'
    text: is the sort of technically the most
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '197.44'
    text: relevant part to the poster proposal but
  - dur: '3.239'
    start: '200'
    text: I want to make sure that that&amp;#39;s couched
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '201.12'
    text: in the context of like there&amp;#39;s a reason
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '203.239'
    text: why I like this paper and this because
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '205.08'
    text: I&amp;#39;m interested in this topic um so
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '209.879'
    text: trying to trying to sort of flesh out
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '211.72'
    text: like the methodologies involved in your
  - dur: '5.961'
    start: '213.799'
    text: area of research um the kind of like and
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '217.519'
    text: like the empirical sort of grounding of
  - dur: '3.039'
    start: '219.76'
    text: it like in the sense of so what are the
  - dur: '3.2'
    start: '221.48'
    text: methodologies used what are the tools
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '222.799'
    text: that are used to collect the relevant
  - dur: '5.759'
    start: '224.68'
    text: data for whatever the topic may be um
  - dur: '3.239'
    start: '228.72'
    text: and then how does that kind of map on to
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '230.439'
    text: the kind of conversations we&amp;#39;ve been
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '231.959'
    text: having around cameras and motion capture
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '234.239'
    text: and sort of you know what is the what is
  - dur: '4'
    start: '236.4'
    text: the sort of the core empirical tool
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '238.36'
    text: involved what does it measure what are
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '240.4'
    text: the sort of what are the units that get
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '242.2'
    text: derived from that and what are the you
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '244.239'
    text: know what are the the the data types and
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '247.36'
    text: structures that the um that the sort of
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '250.439'
    text: scientific insights in your area of
  - dur: '8.16'
    start: '252.319'
    text: focus are sort of build on top of
  - dur: '7.48'
    start: '255.84'
    text: um and that will kind of culminate into
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '260.479'
    text: a sort of like a follow-up proposal like
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '263.32'
    text: proposal proposal number two which will
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '265.68'
    text: be uh sort of like a fleshed out version
  - dur: '7.081'
    start: '268.199'
    text: of the original sort of of like here&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '7.52'
    start: '270.36'
    text: paper I care about thing um
  - dur: '5'
    start: '275.28'
    text: so been thinking about like how what
  - dur: '5.759'
    start: '277.88'
    text: kind of mechanism I want to use for that
  - dur: '7.359'
    start: '280.28'
    text: sort of thing um and I think what it
  - dur: '5.761'
    start: '283.639'
    text: will wind up being is a a a a base level
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '287.639'
    text: assignment that will live on canvas and
  - dur: '8.4'
    start: '289.4'
    text: in the GitHub repo uh that will involve
  - dur: '7.359'
    start: '292.56'
    text: you copy pasting some text uh from your
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '297.8'
    text: own kind of like the profile thing that
  - dur: '5.481'
    start: '299.919'
    text: you have been generating and pasting
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '301.96'
    text: that into a set of chats from the bot
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '305.4'
    text: that will be sort of prompted in in the
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '307.52'
    text: server um that will be sort of the idea
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '311.52'
    text: will be like you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll go in there
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '312.96'
    text: you you&amp;#39;ll start with whatever your last
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '315.68'
    text: um whatever the the most relevant blob
  - dur: '3'
    start: '318.4'
    text: of text you have about what your
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '320'
    text: interest are and what the paper is that
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '321.4'
    text: you in the topic You&amp;#39; chosen take that
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '323.4'
    text: into a chat space and then the bot in
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '326.24'
    text: that space will be prompted to ask you
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '327.6'
    text: about a certain sort of layer of the
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '329.84'
    text: I&amp;#39;ve been talking about um and then at
  - dur: '3.08'
    start: '333.28'
    text: the end of that you&amp;#39;ll ask it for a
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '334.68'
    text: summary possibly using a prompt that
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '336.36'
    text: I&amp;#39;ll provide and then take that and put
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '338.52'
    text: it into another chat and then have
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '340.039'
    text: another sort of layer of conversation um
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '343.12'
    text: and then the output of sort of those set
  - dur: '5.519'
    start: '345.96'
    text: of conversations will be something
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '347.88'
    text: resembling the poster proposal to that
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '351.479'
    text: will sort of be the fleshed out version
  - dur: '5.761'
    start: '352.759'
    text: of what you&amp;#39;re looking at um and the
  - dur: '3.08'
    start: '356.6'
    text: reason for the structure is like I
  - dur: '3.08'
    start: '358.52'
    text: thought about trying to make just like
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '359.68'
    text: like one chat like we&amp;#39;ve been doing that
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '361.6'
    text: sort of does all the stuff but that
  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '363.6'
    text: starts getting really difficult and that
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '365.08'
    text: starts getting into the space that these
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '366.72'
    text: types of AI sort of as implemented here
  - dur: '2.959'
    start: '369.96'
    text: just can&amp;#39;t really do like they&amp;#39;re not
  - dur: '4'
    start: '371.28'
    text: really like it&amp;#39;s like if you give it a
  - dur: '4.481'
    start: '372.919'
    text: set of instructions it&amp;#39;s not really good
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '375.28'
    text: at like two-part instructions like do
  - dur: '3.519'
    start: '377.4'
    text: this and then do that like it&amp;#39;s just not
  - dur: '3.041'
    start: '379.199'
    text: set up for that you can set up the code
  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '380.919'
    text: on the back end to handle some of the
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '382.24'
    text: stuff automatically but it&amp;#39;s much much
  - dur: '6.801'
    start: '384.039'
    text: easier to just like make two versions of
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '387.72'
    text: the prompt and then just give you the
  - dur: '4.759'
    start: '390.84'
    text: intelligent humans instructions that say
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '393.24'
    text: do this and then do that
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '395.599'
    text: um and the idea will be kind of like you
  - dur: '2.961'
    start: '399.039'
    text: know you&amp;#39;ll be setting yourself up for
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '400.4'
    text: the next conversation and that will also
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '402'
    text: give you some sort of experience but
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '403.8'
    text: like directed prompting and that kind of
  - dur: '8.319'
    start: '406.16'
    text: like aiish training thing
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '409.4'
    text: um and like the the the conversations
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '414.479'
    text: and prompts that I set up for you will
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '416.12'
    text: be kind of built out of the lectures
  - dur: '2.841'
    start: '418.599'
    text: that I&amp;#39;ve been giving Which on the
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '420.08'
    text: YouTube playlist which is linked in the
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '421.44'
    text: server um so I&amp;#39;ll be like you know doing
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '425.36'
    text: something I&amp;#39;ve been doing might may not
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '426.84'
    text: be obvious to you like of uh pulling the
  - dur: '2.961'
    start: '429.039'
    text: transcripts from those lectures and kind
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '430.72'
    text: of pulling out the main points and sort
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '432'
    text: of using that to help drive the
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '434.44'
    text: conversation
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '436.4'
    text: um and so that&amp;#39;s why it will sort of I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '439.24'
    text: counting that sort of set of chats as
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '441.039'
    text: like an exam like object where you will
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '443.039'
    text: have a set of things to do um and if you
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '446.28'
    text: don&amp;#39;t do those things you&amp;#39;ll get a bad
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '448.479'
    text: gr and it will be somehow

    text: culminative and based off of stuff that
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '453.16'
    text: has happened before which I think is
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '454.56'
    text: like the legal definition of a
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '457.56'
    text: test um and then that will kind of set
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '460'
    text: you up for The Proposal Part which is
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '461.84'
    text: another requirement of the structure of
  - dur: '7.16'
    start: '463.96'
    text: the classes to make sure that by
  - dur: '7.72'
    start: '466.039'
    text: this week um pushing it um you&amp;#39;re set up
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '471.12'
    text: to actually hypothetically start working
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '473.759'
    text: on the actual poster with the kind of
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '475.84'
    text: fleshed out nature that that needs to
  - dur: '3.401'
    start: '478.319'
    text: be um
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '480.24'
    text: so I
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '481.72'
    text: will it&amp;#39;s the the lecture pulling stuff
  - dur: '2.88'
    start: '484.4'
    text: is the reason why I&amp;#39;m not ready to give
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '485.8'
    text: you anything today but I have all that
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '487.28'
    text: stuff it&amp;#39;s kind of like uploading like
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '489.24'
    text: the videos they they take a long time to
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '491.8'
    text: upload so I have to wait for the last
  - dur: '5.041'
    start: '493.319'
    text: one to get up there because I only put

    start: '505.639'
    text: class you can ask questions things like
  - dur: '6.68'
    start: '507.08'
    text: that um and then
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '510.12'
    text: you know leading in that be sort of
  - dur: '4'
    start: '513.76'
    text: uh hypothetically Doe by the end of week
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '516.44'
    text: seven which
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '517.76'

    start: '523.2'
    text: and so now I&amp;#39;m going to give a little
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '525.399'
    text: bit of time talking about the the
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '527.839'
    text: posters themselves and sort of I&amp;#39;ll put
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '529.519'
    text: some templates into the um into the
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '532.64'
    text: server and I I&amp;#39;ll get those in the
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '534.76'
    text: relevant place on campus soon um but
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '537.88'
    text: before I do that before you look to
  - dur: '7.719'
    start: '539.8'
    text: closly uh there any questions so far any
  - dur: '6.679'
    start: '542.6'
    text: sort of like concerns stress levels
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '547.519'
    text: things that if you knew you would feel
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '549.279'
    text: more comfortable about your status here
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '552.36'
    text: someone sent me an email asking about
  - dur: '3.119'
    start: '553.72'
    text: the poster like structure itself for
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '555.959'
    text: that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re going to talk about
  - dur: '6.68'
    start: '556.839'
    text: today um yeah
  - dur: '3'
    start: '560.519'
    text: great
  - dur: '3.2'
    start: '568.16'
    text: okay okay
  - dur: '7.041'
    start: '571.399'
    text: so the poster itself these are just some
  - dur: '6.88'
    start: '575.24'
    text: examples that I found um from previous
  - dur: '6.92'
    start: '578.44'
    text: courses taught
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '582.12'
    text: uh which is made more difficult because
  - dur: '6.88'
    start: '585.36'
    text: I don&amp;#39;t have PowerPoint on this
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '588.44'
    text: computer um but that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '8.601'
    start: '593.839'
    text: okay okay we that one
  - dur: '8.12'
    start: '597.6'
    text: um so this is a PowerPoint slide uh it
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '602.44'
    text: is you know PowerPoint or Google Slides
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '605.72'
    text: I think it&amp;#39;s the equivalent or keynote
  - dur: '6.959'
    start: '608'
    text: on Mac is the equivalent of that
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '612.2'
    text: um I&amp;#39;m sure a lot of you has PowerPoint
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '614.959'
    text: slides in it um but it&amp;#39;s long story
  - dur: '2.801'
    start: '617.519'
    text: short the nice thing about something
  - dur: '2.921'
    start: '619.079'
    text: like a PowerPoint is that is a
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '620.32'
    text: vector-based
  - dur: '7.64'
    start: '622'
    text: art thing um meaning that these visuals
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '626.8'
    text: are defined not by sort of pixels on an
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '629.64'
    text: image like a lot like most images like
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '631.64'
    text: if you zoom in on them they start you
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '633.44'
    text: could start to see the pixels um uh
  - dur: '3.481'
    start: '636.839'
    text: Vector base Graphics are not like that
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '638.8'
    text: they are because they&amp;#39;re defined
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '640.32'
    text: mathematically like this curve here is
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '642.68'
    text: not defined as a set of dots it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '644.44'
    text: defined as like a mathematical
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '646.2'
    text: definition of how to draw this shape and
  - dur: '3.759'
    start: '648.2'
    text: everything on the PowerPoint page is
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '650.56'
    text: that way so the advantage there is that
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '651.959'
    text: you can zoom it up infinitely and you&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '3.719'
    start: '654.36'
    text: never see the pixels because it is not
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '655.92'
    text: based on pixels um the opposite of
  - dur: '5'
    start: '658.079'
    text: vector base is raster based um and
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '661.44'
    text: that&amp;#39;s most images where if like you
  - dur: '3.721'
    start: '663.079'
    text: take a screenshot and zoom in it start
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '665'
    text: you can only zoom in to the level of the
  - dur: '6.159'
    start: '666.8'
    text: resolution of the image um so most
  - dur: '5.481'
    start: '670.639'
    text: posters are made with a vector-based
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '672.959'
    text: visualization method um PowerPoint is I
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '676.12'
    text: would say like the entry level version
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '678.04'
    text: of that PowerPoint are an equivalent of
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '680'
    text: PowerPoint um and for the vast majority
  - dur: '4'
    start: '682.839'
    text: of you I would say almost all of you
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '685.12'
    text: except for someone who has like a really
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '686.839'
    text: specific interest in like design um I
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '689.519'
    text: would just say use use PowerPoint use
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '692.12'
    text: Google whatever it is use whatever just
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '694.639'
    text: make basically a single page a single
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '697.32'
    text: slide that has information about your
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '700.04'
    text: poster there if you&amp;#39;re feeling fancy and
  - dur: '6.081'
    start: '702.279'
    text: want to do the prograde version of this
  - dur: '7.159'
    start: '704.8'
    text: um the professional version of a vector
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '708.36'
    text: graphics editor is called Adobe Adobe
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '711.959'
    text: Illustrator is like the main one um you
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '714.2'
    text: all have free access to the Adobe
  - dur: '4.521'
    start: '716.519'
    text: Creative s Suite through your

    start: '718.519'
    text: Northeastern email email um you don&amp;#39;t

    text: know how to do that just ask someone
  - dur: '6'
    start: '723.04'
    text: that&amp;#39;s not me um how to get access no
  - dur: '3.399'

    start: '731.92'
    text: with your north eastern account no you
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '733.72'
    text: have to uh you have to go to a a
  - dur: '6.361'
    start: '736.199'
    text: specific website and then go to and
  - dur: '6.639'
    start: '738.32'
    text: submit a request for a license okay well
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '742.56'
    text: that&amp;#39;s too bad but it takes like a day
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '744.959'
    text: or so a day or two yeah so if you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '746.839'
    text: into that you can do it um there&amp;#39;s also
  - dur: '8.04'
    start: '748.88'
    text: um inkscape is a free version of Adobe
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '752.639'
    text: Illustrator um which I&amp;#39;ve used it I sort
  - dur: '3.08'
    start: '756.92'
    text: of in the way that these things tend to
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '758.24'
    text: go like the free version has kind of
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '760'
    text: been in development for a long time when
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '761.72'
    text: I was in grad school it wasn&amp;#39;t very good
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '763.88'
    text: and wouldn&amp;#39;t be what I would consider
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '765.48'
    text: like like an like a viable alternative
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '768.68'
    text: um but I&amp;#39;ve used it recently and it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '770.36'
    text: gotten pretty good I think for basic
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '772.44'
    text: usage it might be helpful but it but
  - dur: '3'
    start: '776.32'
    text: realistically don&amp;#39;t expect it to sort of
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '777.76'
    text: be at the same level as illustrator but
  - dur: '4'
    start: '779.32'
    text: also realistically if you&amp;#39;re new to that
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '781.48'
    text: space you&amp;#39;re not going to be using the
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '783.32'
    text: pro tool to the pro level so you can
  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '785.8'
    text: give it a shot
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '789.68'
    text: um and whatever you choose I would say
  - dur: '4.519'
    start: '792.44'
    text: like the stuff that we&amp;#39;ll be doing to
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '794.72'
    text: prepare like the content of the poster
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '796.959'
    text: will be independent of the poster itself
  - dur: '3.279'
    start: '799'
    text: so if you want to try a fancy thing and
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '800.639'
    text: then sort of be like I don&amp;#39;t want to do
  - dur: '4.521'
    start: '802.279'
    text: this um you can convert
  - dur: '5.041'
    start: '805.079'
    text: later
  - dur: '7.76'
    start: '806.8'
    text: uh okay so what should actually go on
  - dur: '7.279'
    start: '810.12'
    text: the poster itself um
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '814.56'
    text: the basically a poster is like a
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '817.399'
    text: distillation of a paper that&amp;#39;s kind of I
  - dur: '3.759'
    start: '820.32'
    text: think the best way to think about it at
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '821.56'
    text: the level that we&amp;#39;re doing in this class
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '824.079'
    text: um that&amp;#39;s not all that a poster has to
  - dur: '7'
    start: '826.32'
    text: be um it could be other things um but
  - dur: '5.961'
    start: '830.399'
    text: the default sort of purpose of a poster
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '833.32'
    text: is to kind of give you a representation
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '836.36'
    text: of a particular study typically that you
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '839.199'
    text: typically i&amp;#39; say almost exclusively that
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '841.12'
    text: you yourself are doing um so that you
  - dur: '3.761'
    start: '844.399'
    text: can take it to something like a
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '845.56'
    text: conference and then put it up and then
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '848.16'
    text: have then stand next to it and hope
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '849.72'
    text: people come by and talk to you about it
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '851.92'
    text: um I showed you some pictures of like
  - dur: '5.519'
    start: '853.68'
    text: scientific conference poster sessions
  - dur: '6'
    start: '855.88'
    text: you can just you know sort of uh that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '859.199'
    text: the that is the the structure that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '861.88'
    text: being sort of mimicked here um so and at
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '865.279'
    text: the end of the semester that roughly
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '868.72'
    text: speaking
  - dur: '2.401'
    start: '870.079'
    text: where they
  - dur: '6.479'
    start: '876.92'
    text: go uh the week of April 7th there will
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '881'
    text: be a poster session for all the
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '883.399'
    text: inquiries classes and you&amp;#39;ll be assigned
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '886.079'
    text: one of the days and that will be your
  - dur: '5.479'
    start: '888.36'
    text: day to present um and you&amp;#39;ll present
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '890.92'
    text: your poster along with half of the
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '893.839'
    text: students in each other class and then if
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '896.04'
    text: you&amp;#39;re not presenting then your
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '897.44'
    text: assignment will be to go around
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '899.56'
    text: and partake in the posters um including
  - dur: '3.361'
    start: '903.519'
    text: you know a certain number of posters
  - dur: '2.799'
    start: '905.72'
    text: from this class and a certain number of
  - dur: '2.68'
    start: '906.88'
    text: posters from the other classes so you
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '908.519'
    text: can kind of
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '909.56'
    text: like get the experience of what that
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '912.12'
    text: sort of process looks like and feels
  - dur: '3'
    start: '914.36'
    text: like
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '921.04'
    text: um
  - dur: '3'
    start: '923.68'
    text: yeah
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '927.319'
    text: so yeah so like I said I said before and
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '929.92'
    text: we&amp;#39;ll say again
  - dur: '4.759'
    start: '932'
    text: um there there&amp;#39;s kind of there&amp;#39;s the
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '934.36'
    text: default version of the assignment and

    text: so I&amp;#39;m mostly going to be talking about
  - dur: '6.279'
    start: '944.48'
    text: the default assignment which is just
  - dur: '7.601'
    start: '946.759'
    text: pick a paper and present that paper as
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '950.759'
    text: if you were you know a person I don&amp;#39;t I
  - dur: '3.2'
    start: '954.36'
    text: don&amp;#39;t know if they like what the other
  - dur: '3.519'
    start: '956'
    text: class say in terms of like should be
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '957.56'
    text: like role playing like a grass in the
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '959.519'
    text: lab or should you I think that gets kind
  - dur: '3'
    start: '961.8'
    text: of weird just or you can just be like my
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '963.6'
    text: paper they blah blah blah just talk
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '964.8'
    text: about it in the third person
  - dur: '5.481'
    start: '967.199'
    text: um but yeah but you also have the option
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '970.079'
    text: of like you know if you want to add more
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '972.68'
    text: citations there if you want to talk
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '973.92'
    text: about other things
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '976.8'
    text: um I think if you want to use any of the
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '981.04'
    text: data that we use in this class as part
  - dur: '4.479'
    start: '983.92'
    text: of your poster um we can sort of set
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '986.56'
    text: that up basically like any of the data
  - dur: '5.041'
    start: '988.399'
    text: that you&amp;#39;ve seen
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '990'
    text: before now before April 7th I&amp;#39;ll have
  - dur: '2.92'
    start: '993.44'
    text: I&amp;#39;ll make that into a place where you
  - dur: '4'
    start: '994.68'
    text: can like pull screenshots and sort of
  - dur: '4.479'
    start: '996.36'
    text: just like talk about it um if you wanted
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '998.68'
    text: to have the experience of using like
  - dur: '3.881'
    start: '1000.839'
    text: actual data that you&amp;#39;ve been a part of
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '1002.48'
    text: as part of your presentation that&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '1004.72'
    text: viable option
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '1008.36'
    text: um
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '1010.319'
    text: yeah
  - dur: '6.081'
    start: '1011.959'
    text: so in terms
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '1014.639'
    text: of yeah so in terms of like how do you
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '1018.04'
    text: put the poster together together how do
  - dur: '6.919'
    start: '1019.92'
    text: you you know from a given paper or topic
  - dur: '7.641'
    start: '1023.079'
    text: area how do you actually create a poster
  - dur: '6.921'
    start: '1026.839'
    text: uh that&amp;#39;s where there is sort of like
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '1030.72'
    text: instructions about that um which I think
  - dur: '3.039'
    start: '1033.76'
    text: might on this
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '1038.919'
    text: one there are some instructions from
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1041.24'
    text: other classes that I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll pull up
  - dur: '6.081'
    start: '1042.559'
    text: that are sort of more written setup but
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '1045.64'
    text: um the basic idea is that you&amp;#39;re not
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '1048.64'
    text: what you&amp;#39;re not supposed to do is put
  - dur: '3.719'
    start: '1050.96'
    text: all the information in the poster all
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '1053.039'
    text: the information in the paper on the
  - dur: '6.401'
    start: '1054.679'
    text: poster um you don&amp;#39;t want to have what we
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '1058.24'
    text: call affectionately um a wall of text
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '1061.08'
    text: poster we all know what it feels like to
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '1063.039'
    text: be confronted with a big wall of text
  - dur: '6.159'
    start: '1064.76'
    text: it&amp;#39;s not fun um and it doesn&amp;#39;t really
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '1068.6'
    text: it&amp;#39;s not helpful to you as a as a person
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '1070.919'
    text: coming in um something that I think
  - dur: '3.521'
    start: '1073.679'
    text: really needs to be driven home over and
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '1075.24'
    text: over and over again is that science the
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '1077.2'
    text: scientific process is primarily a
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '1079.039'
    text: process of communication if you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.481'
    start: '1081.159'
    text: sitting alone in your lab collecting
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '1082.679'
    text: data and running running numbers and
  - dur: '2.88'
    start: '1084.64'
    text: stuff like that and you never actually
  - dur: '2.841'
    start: '1085.919'
    text: show it to anybody else you&amp;#39;re not
  - dur: '2.88'
    start: '1087.52'
    text: actually doing science you&amp;#39;re just kind
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '1088.76'
    text: of like you&amp;#39;re doing an investigation
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '1090.4'
    text: you&amp;#39;re playing around with data but the
  - dur: '3.479'
    start: '1092.32'
    text: process of science is is a process of
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '1093.96'
    text: communication so when you&amp;#39;re present in
  - dur: '6'
    start: '1095.799'
    text: this sort of interface of a poster or a
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '1098.4'
    text: paper um is the traditional method for
  - dur: '6.081'
    start: '1101.799'
    text: communicating science to other
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '1103.84'
    text: people uh presenting a poster in a
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '1107.88'
    text: conference kind of you know I I say
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '1110.24'
    text: unofficially counts as a peer- review
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '1112.32'
    text: type of session but you can&amp;#39;t say this
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '1114.52'
    text: is a peer reviewed poster um but you are
  - dur: '6'
    start: '1116.88'
    text: getting it reviewed by your peers um in
  - dur: '4.521'
    start: '1119.799'
    text: the sense that you know people other
  - dur: '2.72'
    start: '1122.88'
    text: people who know the area are going to
  - dur: '2.88'
    start: '1124.32'
    text: look at what you&amp;#39;ve done and
  - dur: '3.04'
    start: '1125.6'
    text: hypothetically have the option of saying
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '1127.2'
    text: oh hey you made a mistake here there or
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '1128.64'
    text: the other um which is a Cornerstone of
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '1131.4'
    text: how we do sort of science you know I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1135.08'
    text: sort of I&amp;#39;m talking about a system that
  - dur: '7.041'
    start: '1136.679'
    text: I&amp;#39;m pretty uh jaded about so I&amp;#39;ll talk
  - dur: '9.359'
    start: '1139.32'
    text: about it kind of in the idealized form
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '1143.72'
    text: um so so yeah so so when you are
  - dur: '3.281'
    start: '1148.679'
    text: translating whatever poster you&amp;#39;re doing
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '1150.84'
    text: whatever topic you&amp;#39;re doing whatever
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '1151.96'
    text: project you&amp;#39;re doing into poster form it
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '1154.76'
    text: your job is to kind of do the
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '1156.24'
    text: distillation like it&amp;#39;s you&amp;#39;re the you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '1158.08'
    text: the person hypothetically who
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '1160.2'
    text: understands the project better than
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '1162'
    text: anyone else like argue like if it&amp;#39;s your
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '1164'
    text: research project you probably understand
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '1165.96'
    text: the nitty-gritty of it better than
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '1167.64'
    text: anybody else in the world and the people
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1169.72'
    text: that you&amp;#39;re going to be communicating
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1171.08'
    text: with are only going to be talking to you
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '1173.72'
    text: for like a couple of minutes like you
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1175.96'
    text: know 5 10 minutes at most you know not
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '1177.919'
    text: at most but um a very short amount of
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1181.08'
    text: time like if you look at you know the
  - dur: '3.121'
    start: '1184.159'
    text: picture of like sfn or something like
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '1185.84'
    text: that there&amp;#39;s thousands and thousands of
  - dur: '3.04'
    start: '1187.28'
    text: posters and if you&amp;#39;re a person you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '2.48'
    start: '1189.28'
    text: not going to see all of them you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.2'
    start: '1190.32'
    text: going to go to a particular area but
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '1191.76'
    text: you&amp;#39;re not going to be spending hours
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '1193.52'
    text: and hours on each poster you&amp;#39;re going to
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '1195.44'
    text: be kind of coming up and
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '1197.4'
    text: saying hey what&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s the deal here
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '1201.12'
    text: and your job as the presenter is to be
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '1203.96'
    text: able to give them the deal like tell
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1206.36'
    text: them what was what the study was and
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '1208.08'
    text: what what happened at a level where if
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '1211.36'
    text: they just sat there quietly and listen
  - dur: '5.559'
    start: '1213.24'
    text: to you then you could get sort of from
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '1215.12'
    text: start to finish let&amp;#39;s say within 3 to 5
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '1218.799'
    text: minutes um and the person listening
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '1222.24'
    text: knows enough of what&amp;#39;s going on that
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '1224.44'
    text: they can walk away and say oh yeah that
  - dur: '2.839'
    start: '1226.32'
    text: poster they did this thing they found
  - dur: '4.039'
    start: '1227.88'
    text: this result they
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '1229.159'
    text: you know they will if you&amp;#39;ve done a good
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '1231.919'
    text: job they will walk away with a certain
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '1233.52'
    text: sort of gut level takeaway um that they
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '1236.64'
    text: can that they will then be able to
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '1238.159'
    text: explain what your study was about
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '1240.32'
    text: without having to know all the details
  - dur: '6.799'
    start: '1242.88'
    text: itself um so there&amp;#39;s a certain strategy
  - dur: '7.199'
    start: '1245.84'
    text: on what you put on a poster uh where you
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '1249.679'
    text: want to make sure that you are like the
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '1253.039'
    text: takeaways that that person walks away
  - dur: '3.441'
    start: '1254.919'
    text: with should be the takeaways that you
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '1256.679'
    text: want them to walk away with like there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '1258.36'
    text: a lot of things in a given research
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '1260.76'
    text: study um and you can present the same
  - dur: '3.721'
    start: '1264.159'
    text: study in five different ways and sort of
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '1265.96'
    text: have the person walk away with five
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1267.88'
    text: different hopefully not like in
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '1270.279'
    text: hopefully not like incon herent
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '1272.76'
    text: inconsistent beliefs but you know you
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '1274.96'
    text: can focus on you know one thing or
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '1277.2'
    text: another and you want to make sure that
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '1278.799'
    text: you&amp;#39;re packaging it in a way that will
  - dur: '2.68'
    start: '1281.52'
    text: they will be able to understand that
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '1282.559'
    text: will stick and that they will be able to
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '1284.2'
    text: walk away and when they say hey that
  - dur: '3.479'
    start: '1286.2'
    text: study over there was was about this
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '1288.039'
    text: person doing this thing and finding this
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '1289.679'
    text: result that they&amp;#39;re saying roughly
  - dur: '6.439'
    start: '1292.12'
    text: speaking what you believe about that
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '1295.52'
    text: thing um now I said if that&amp;#39;s what would
  - dur: '3.081'
    start: '1298.559'
    text: happen if the person just stands there
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '1299.84'
    text: politely and doesn&amp;#39;t say anything which
  - dur: '3.519'
    start: '1301.64'
    text: sometimes is what happens and typically
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '1303.24'
    text: it&amp;#39;s not
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '1305.159'
    text: uh the
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '1307.08'
    text: um it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not necessarily an
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '1309.24'
    text: insult especially at conferences that
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '1310.679'
    text: people are tired and they want to get
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '1312.2'
    text: the the the gist but um in general in
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '1315.919'
    text: Academia and the Sciences if somebody
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '1318.6'
    text: starts criticizing your work a lot and
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '1320.84'
    text: then just starts pulling it to pieces
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '1322.64'
    text: and picking up the threads it&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '1324.96'
    text: compliment like they care enough about
  - dur: '3.239'
    start: '1327.32'
    text: what you&amp;#39;re doing to think about it and
  - dur: '3.399'
    start: '1328.88'
    text: ask questions and it could be really
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '1330.559'
    text: offputting to people especially students
  - dur: '8.121'
    start: '1332.279'
    text: who are used to fatigue being like to
  - dur: '7.84'
    start: '1335.12'
    text: give you a a rank order in your grade um
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '1340.4'
    text: but if I&amp;#39;m asking a lot of questions
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '1342.96'
    text: it&amp;#39;s because I want to know more and I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '1345.039'
    text: I&amp;#39;m using my time and my energy and my
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '1346.76'
    text: attention to do the thing that I was
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '1348.279'
    text: train to do as a scientist who is peer
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '1350.24'
    text: reviewing other other research which is
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '1352.6'

    start: '1358.279'
    text: necessarily like to Target the mistakes
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '1359.799'
    text: but just because I want to understand
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '1361.12'
    text: what&amp;#39;s going on and I want to make sure
  - dur: '3.161'
    start: '1363.279'
    text: that it was done right because we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '1364.279'
    text: trying to sort of create new knowledge
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '1366.44'
    text: here
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '1367.96'
    text: um so that&amp;#39;s where the second part of
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '1370.88'
    text: the strategy comes in where if you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '1373.32'
    text: presenting the
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '1374.44'
    text: poster you&amp;#39;re never please do not just
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '1377.64'
    text: read it to the person that&amp;#39;s not fun for
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1380.08'
    text: anybody um but you&amp;#39;re going to present
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '1382.24'
    text: it in a high level way and then so that
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '1384.08'
    text: when the person asks
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '1386.039'
    text: questions ideally you have the answer to
  - dur: '3.279'
    start: '1388.88'
    text: that question right there W waiting so
  - dur: '3.08'
    start: '1390.88'
    text: even though you might be just zipping
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '1392.159'
    text: through this and sort of like moving
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '1393.96'
    text: past this stuff because it&amp;#39;s your study
  - dur: '3.719'
    start: '1397.08'
    text: there&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '5.041'
    start: '1398.159'
    text: certain like the first time you present
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '1400.799'
    text: something you might be surprised by the
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '1403.2'
    text: questions that you get but after the
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1404.76'
    text: first couple of conversations you
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '1406.36'
    text: realize that 90% of the questions that
  - dur: '5.759'
    start: '1409.4'
    text: you get are predictable in some way and
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '1412.48'
    text: so you should just have those questions
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '1415.159'
    text: sort of answerable from the data that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '1416.799'
    text: on the paper so you know this type of
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '1420.08'
    text: stuff is a good example
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '1422.159'
    text: where I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to be talking
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '1424.4'
    text: about um oh yeah we did this study with
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '1427.48'
    text: this mouse Maze and there was the water
  - dur: '2.52'
    start: '1429.48'
    text: was this deep and the thing was this big
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '1430.72'
    text: I don&amp;#39;t want to be describing the size
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '1432'
    text: of the whole of the of the apparatus but
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '1434.52'
    text: if the person asks how deep it was I
  - dur: '3.081'
    start: '1436.919'
    text: should have an answer for it and
  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '1438.12'
    text: actually they wouldn&amp;#39;t even have to ask
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '1440'
    text: that question they can just look at the
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '1441.24'
    text: picture and get that themselves um
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '1444.44'
    text: similarly with a lot of like the the
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '1446.159'
    text: method like often times that&amp;#39;s where you
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '1447.72'
    text: put like details that you know you
  - dur: '3.039'
    start: '1451.12'
    text: wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily say you could say
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '1452.76'
    text: oh yeah we have this rat do this thing
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '1454.159'
    text: and this maze but the details are there
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '1456.24'
    text: so the person can just kind of skim them
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '1457.679'
    text: and kind of know the answer there
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1462.12'
    text: um and
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '1469.399'
    text: yeah and I will say I think that the you
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '1472.24'
    text: know there should be some kind of a
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '1473.76'
    text: methods section uh which should have
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '1477.08'
    text: some visual representation of like what
  - dur: '5.919'
    start: '1479.64'
    text: you actually did what the study actually
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '1481.6'
    text: was like you know this is a good example
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '1485.559'
    text: because it&amp;#39;s like I know by looking at
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '1487.12'
    text: this that you looked at mice in a water
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '1489.159'
    text: bucket with a camera you know you could
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '1491.48'
    text: just as easily have you know if you skip
  - dur: '3.319'
    start: '1494.08'
    text: this type of thing oh yeah you have this
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '1495.84'
    text: with a camera and I know that there were
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1497.399'
    text: three conditions and one of them was a
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '1500.159'
    text: sham meaning they didn&amp;#39;t give it do
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '1502.159'
    text: anything one is injured and one is
  - dur: '5.041'
    start: '1504.679'
    text: whatever this condition is and so now I
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '1508.08'
    text: have a sense of like what it is that you
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1509.72'
    text: actually did it&amp;#39;s really easy when you
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '1512.039'
    text: know something too well to skip the
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '1514.6'
    text: parts I call it skipping Step Zero it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '1517.2'
    text: like the things the immediate questions
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1519.159'
    text: that anybody coming into would ask are
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '1521.36'
    text: the first things that you forget to
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '1523.559'
    text: explain when you get into it so it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '2.92'
    start: '1525.72'
    text: like you know you can have this if
  - dur: '3.161'
    start: '1527.279'
    text: you&amp;#39;re just showing the result blah blah
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '1528.64'
    text: blah blah blah I could be like halfway
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '1530.44'
    text: into my conversation but then my person
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '1532.32'
    text: asked wait are these mice are they rats
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '1534.72'
    text: are they fruit flies are are they on a
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '1537.039'
    text: treadmill are these celegans you know
  - dur: '2.679'
    start: '1539.88'
    text: they start asking questions that make it
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '1541.36'
    text: clear it&amp;#39;s like oh they don&amp;#39;t even
  - dur: '7.161'
    start: '1542.559'
    text: know like basic thing that I did which
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '1545.44'
    text: is stand in a room with m in a water bat
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '1549.72'
    text: um so the method section should always
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1551.76'
    text: have something that just makes it clear
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '1552.96'
    text: what that is in my preference that will
  - dur: '3.399'
    start: '1556.52'
    text: typically be figure one in whatever
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '1558.6'
    text: paper you&amp;#39;re looking at this isn&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '1559.919'
    text: always the case but I I think this is
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '1562.12'
    text: true for papers as well like figure one
  - dur: '3.561'
    start: '1564.399'
    text: or something very close to figure one
  - dur: '3.559'
    start: '1566.48'
    text: should be some kind of a picture that
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '1567.96'
    text: makes it clear what you&amp;#39;re actually
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '1570.039'
    text: doing and the results over here um
  - dur: '4.039'
    start: '1573.64'
    text: should be some representation of the
  - dur: '7.2'
    start: '1575.12'
    text: data that was recorded uh
  - dur: '7.24'
    start: '1577.679'
    text: typically there&amp;#39;s going to be I
  - dur: '5.479'
    start: '1582.32'
    text: guess yeah you want there to be some
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '1584.919'
    text: nice Harmony here um and this is also
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '1587.799'
    text: typically where you are it&amp;#39;s your job to
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '1589.76'
    text: kind of choose the most important data
  - dur: '4.039'
    start: '1593'
    text: um for a lot of papers and certainly for
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '1594.799'
    text: a lot of studies you&amp;#39;re produce a lot of
  - dur: '5.481'
    start: '1597.039'
    text: data um and a lot of visualizations
  - dur: '6.039'
    start: '1599.76'
    text: showing various things related to the
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '1602.52'
    text: data that you recorded um like whatever
  - dur: '5.961'
    start: '1605.799'
    text: paper you choose like it could have you
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '1607.6'
    text: know five six 10 or more um figures of
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '1611.76'
    text: data in it but your job is to understand
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '1614.44'
    text: what&amp;#39;s the main figure what&amp;#39;s the main
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '1616.44'
    text: result you know and if I if if I can
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '1619.039'
    text: only show one or two results from this
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1621.24'
    text: paper what should those results be and
  - dur: '3.439'
    start: '1624.12'
    text: those should be the results that back up
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '1626'
    text: the conclusions and then keep your
  - dur: '6.561'
    start: '1627.559'
    text: directions if that&amp;#39;s appropriate um of
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '1631.08'
    text: the study itself so I you know
  - dur: '4.039'
    start: '1634.12'
    text: introduction is typically it&amp;#39;s kind of
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '1635.64'
    text: like the you know here&amp;#39;s why we did this
  - dur: '3.201'
    start: '1638.159'
    text: this is where you can have citations if
  - dur: '3.081'
    start: '1639.559'
    text: you want them like we did this because
  - dur: '3.199'
    start: '1641.36'
    text: it&amp;#39;s related to this other study that
  - dur: '3.399'
    start: '1642.64'
    text: did this other thing we did this because
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '1644.559'
    text: there is this group of papers that sort
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '1646.039'
    text: of suggested this effect is true and so
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '1648.72'
    text: we did this study to test if that effect
  - dur: '3.719'
    start: '1650.44'
    text: is true
  - dur: '3.479'
    start: '1652.2'
    text: um breaking it out into research
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1654.159'
    text: question hypothesis is fine not
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '1655.679'
    text: everything has this stuff so delineate
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '1658.159'
    text: if it&amp;#39;s fine uh some kind of method
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '1661.159'
    text: saying here&amp;#39;s what we did some kind of a
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '1663.32'
    text: data data representation of like here&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.721'
    start: '1665.519'
    text: the main results and some kind of a
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '1667.24'
    text: conclusion because of all the stuff that
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '1669.24'
    text: we did we believe that some fact of the
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '1671.44'
    text: world is the case um some new proposed
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '1675.039'
    text: fact of the world is the case like I
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '1677.48'
    text: this this is ifate the part where you
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1679.32'
    text: say the things that you now believe
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '1681.12'
    text: because of the research that you did and
  - dur: '3.479'
    start: '1683.32'
    text: you hope that after going through this
  - dur: '2.8'
    start: '1685.2'
    text: little journey people that you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '1686.799'
    text: talking to the people who are reading
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '1688'
    text: the paper um will also believe you
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '1690.96'
    text: they&amp;#39;ll say yeah the things that you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '1692.32'
    text: describing seem supported they seem
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '1694.84'
    text: reasonable I will go along with you on
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1697.679'
    text: this you know and then if enough people
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '1701.12'
    text: are convinced by the story that you&amp;#39;ve
  - dur: '7.281'
    start: '1702.679'
    text: told it becomes a quote unquote
  - dur: '6.68'
    start: '1706.44'
    text: scientific fact which is
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1709.96'
    text: always something to be wary
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '1713.12'
    text: of because we&amp;#39;re always wrong about
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '1715.08'
    text: everything and and every scientific fact
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '1717.2'
    text: will be proven wrong in the fullness of
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '1718.72'
    text: time um so but we do our best in the
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '1722.72'
    text: moment
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '1725.48'
    text: um one so
  - dur: '6'
    start: '1728.48'
    text: the so generally speaking uh by
  - dur: '5.959'
    start: '1732.2'
    text: generally speaking I&amp;#39;ll say you will
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '1734.48'
    text: pretty much never read a poster to a
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '1738.159'
    text: person like if it&amp;#39;s your poster don&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '4.039'
    start: '1740.36'
    text: read it to the person have some other
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '1742.08'
    text: way of talking about it but the idea is
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1744.399'
    text: that if the person had the poster given
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '1747.44'
    text: to them and they read it from start to
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1749.279'
    text: finish they would know roughly speaking
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '1751.76'
    text: the story that you&amp;#39;re trying to tell um
  - dur: '3.161'
    start: '1753.919'
    text: and so in the poster itself for the
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '1755.48'
    text: actual presentation is kind of there as
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1757.08'
    text: like an it&amp;#39;s sort of an aid for you um
  - dur: '3.2'
    start: '1760'
    text: explaining what you&amp;#39;re doing so you have
  - dur: '2.679'
    start: '1761.72'
    text: so you you don&amp;#39;t you can remember what
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '1763.2'
    text: they&amp;#39;re talking about you have things
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '1764.399'
    text: you can point to you have data you can
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '1766.44'
    text: point to um
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '1769.6'
    text: but yeah sort of
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '1771.24'
    text: a yeah it&amp;#39;s kind of the process there I
  - dur: '5.241'

    text: should also say this is another sort of
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '1776.519'
    text: classic uh way of presenting data where
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '1779.64'
    text: these a points up here are what you
  - dur: '6.041'
    start: '1782.039'
    text: would call Representative data and then
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '1784.44'
    text: this here is some measure of the like
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '1788.08'
    text: the statistics of that data so
  - dur: '6.559'
    start: '1789.96'
    text: representative data is basically like
  - dur: '5.719'
    start: '1793.32'
    text: you can choose like you the researcher
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '1796.519'
    text: because you are a trustworthy person
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '1799.039'
    text: who&amp;#39;s not lying and has ear methods
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '1800.72'
    text: appropriately documented you are allowed
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '1803.32'
    text: to look at the big body of data that you
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '1805.44'
    text: have and pick a particular recording
  - dur: '6.921'
    start: '1808.679'
    text: that is representative of the of what
  - dur: '8.4'
    start: '1811.36'
    text: you&amp;#39;re trying to show um so you might
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '1815.6'
    text: record um so yeah so in this case they
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '1819.76'
    text: put mice in a water bucket and then they
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '1822.64'
    text: had to learn where platform was so they
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '1824.399'
    text: can sort of get out of the water um and
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1828.039'
    text: our case we were doing stuff like you
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '1829.72'
    text: know the jumping task or you know the
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '1832.279'
    text: standing task and so for the standing so
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '1834.559'
    text: imagine for the standing task we
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '1836.12'
    text: recorded 25 different uh participants
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '1839.279'
    text: and you know and each of them did 10
  - dur: '6.481'
    start: '1841.159'
    text: different repetitions of beta that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '1843.799'
    text: that 200 some of Trials whatever um you
  - dur: '6'
    start: '1847.64'
    text: can go in and kind of pick one trial or
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '1850.919'
    text: even one section of one trial that
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '1853.64'
    text: exemplifies the effect that you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.479'
    start: '1855.2'
    text: trying to show um and then just click
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '1858.08'
    text: about that one little part sort of clean
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '1859.679'
    text: up and then past it there and say this
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '1861.32'
    text: is representing a data from a subject in
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '1863.48'
    text: the partip
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '1865.279'
    text: stud um but that&amp;#39;s not really that&amp;#39;s an
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '1869.36'
    text: without additional support that is
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1870.84'
    text: anecdotal that is you just sort of
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '1872.88'
    text: picking one from a set of a thousand
  - dur: '3'
    start: '1875.24'
    text: options and saying this is the one that
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '1877'
    text: looks like the story that I&amp;#39;m trying to
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1878.24'
    text: tell that&amp;#39;s not that that&amp;#39;s not really
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '1881.279'
    text: evidence on itself so you want to have
  - dur: '3.279'
    start: '1883.24'
    text: you want to be able to back that up by
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '1884.88'
    text: having some kind of a measure of
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '1886.519'
    text: Statistics that is looking at all 1,000
  - dur: '3.521'
    start: '1889.799'
    text: trials that you did and sort of
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '1891.24'
    text: appropriately comparing you know
  - dur: '5.239'
    start: '1893.32'
    text: subjects to subjects and conditions to
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '1895.32'
    text: conditions and da da da um so that this
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '1898.559'
    text: is where you actually start having
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '1900.96'
    text: statistical power and statistically
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '1902.679'
    text: supported statements and this is these
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '1905.039'
    text: are the data that kind of like this is
  - dur: '5.041'
    start: '1907.039'
    text: where like the real grounding and sort
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '1908.88'
    text: of knowledge generation comes from um
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '1912.08'
    text: but it&amp;#39;s good to kind of pair both
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1913.919'
    text: because you know the representative
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '1916'
    text: subject data helps the kind of
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '1918.559'
    text: understand what you&amp;#39;re talking about um
  - dur: '3.439'
    start: '1920.36'
    text: or the statistical data helps them
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '1922.36'
    text: understand that this is a thing that
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '1923.799'
    text: happens in general um that&amp;#39;s always
  - dur: '3'
    start: '1926.919'
    text: going to be different based on the
  - dur: '3.481'
    start: '1928.639'
    text: studies and stuff that you&amp;#39;re that
  - dur: '2.201'
    start: '1929.919'
    text: you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3'
    start: '1932.72'
    text: doing
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '1936.159'
    text: um you want to see posters um generally
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '1939.24'
    text: if you just walk around a department in
  - dur: '5.801'
    start: '1942.559'
    text: the school you&amp;#39;ll see posters on the
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '1944.399'
    text: wall um people put their favorite
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1948.36'
    text: posters on the walls outside their lab
  - dur: '3.401'
    start: '1951.039'
    text: uh and so you can just walk around and
  - dur: '2.919'
    start: '1953'
    text: take a look at what they would look like
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '1954.44'
    text: and sort of just get a sense of the sort
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1955.919'
    text: of the styles that are available and
  - dur: '3.719'
    start: '1957.96'
    text: sort of the choices that are made and
  - dur: '3.441'
    start: '1959.919'
    text: you&amp;#39;ll see some with a ton of words on
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '1961.679'
    text: them you&amp;#39;ll see some with very few words
  - dur: '6.799'
    start: '1963.36'
    text: on them um and I recommend just doing
  - dur: '5.719'
    start: '1967.32'
    text: that just go whatever hours the day you
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '1970.159'
    text: want through whatever you know wherever
  - dur: '2.801'
    start: '1973.039'
    text: the various Departments of the school
  - dur: '3.199'
    start: '1974.32'
    text: are and you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll typically find
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '1975.84'
    text: posters on the wall that you can sort of
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1977.519'
    text: look at
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '1979.36'
    text: um in our case the sizes can be very
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '1982.639'
    text: different I&amp;#39;ve gone to conferences where
  - dur: '6.281'
    start: '1984.559'
    text: the posters are like 6ot by 4ot so very
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '1989.039'
    text: very large I&amp;#39;ve gone to some conferences
  - dur: '7.679'
    start: '1990.84'
    text: where they&amp;#39;re like 3T X 3T which is very
  - dur: '7.159'
    start: '1994'
    text: small um I can&amp;#39;t actually remember I I
  - dur: '7.441'
    start: '1998.519'
    text: want to say that our posters are 24 by
  - dur: '6.441'
    start: '2001.159'
    text: 36 Ines um which is like this big but I
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '2005.96'
    text: can&amp;#39;t recall I&amp;#39;ll I&amp;#39;ll look that up
  - dur: '3.199'
    start: '2007.6'
    text: that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s a relevant thing to have
  - dur: '3'
    start: '2009.72'
    text: but mostly that will just affect the
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '2010.799'
    text: font size that you use um this is again
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '2012.72'
    text: with the vector scale stuff like the
  - dur: '7.679'
    start: '2014.6'
    text: actual scale shouldn&amp;#39;t matter too much
  - dur: '6.319'
    start: '2018.36'
    text: um yeah so but it does depend like you
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '2022.279'
    text: know you want to make sure that the font
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '2024.679'
    text: size is not
  - dur: '4.139'
    start: '2027.2'
    text: oppressive
  - dur: '3.059'
    start: '2028.28'
    text: '[Music]'
  - dur: '5.719'
    start: '2031.44'
    text: um yeah also just Google scientific

    start: '2037.159'
    text: is the kind of thing
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '2039.039'
    text: that there will be many many layers of
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '2042.96'
    text: explication and tutorials about how to
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '2044.799'

  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '2046.2'
    text: that and that will all be relevant here
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '2048.679'
    text: um with the exception that you won&amp;#39;t be
  - dur: '3.161'
    start: '2050.879'
    text: writing paper yourself a lot of this

    text: s
  - dur: '6.799'
    start: '2186.28'
    text: okay yeah so like I just do my poster on

    start: '2191.319'
    text: one
  - dur: '5.721'
    start: '2193.079'
    text: paper I just do that on paper is there
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '2197.24'
    text: any
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '2198.8'
    text: otheres not really no um like by the the
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '2202.56'
    text: base level assignment that so so they
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '2205.44'
    text: had a couple yeah
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '2207.92'
    text: um that was S I say again was that they
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '2212'
    text: only reference it in int I&amp;#39;m actually I
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '2214.64'
    text: was looking for that uh cuz I actually
  - dur: '6.8'
    start: '2218.16'
    text: can&amp;#39;t see see where these citations
  - dur: '5.919'
    start: '2221.2'
    text: actually happen in the poster uh I guess
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '2224.96'
    text: this that might be something I can&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '2227.119'
    text: remember so I would actually say they
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '2229.04'
    text: may have this may have just been like
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '2231.319'
    text: incorrectly done because you&amp;#39;re supposed
  - dur: '4'
    start: '2233.24'
    text: to site stuff here but this again for
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '2235.44'
    text: this assignment it&amp;#39;s a little bit weird
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '2237.24'
    text: um so I&amp;#39;d say like the default
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '2239.68'
    text: assumption is that there&amp;#39;s you know the
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '2242'
    text: base level assignment is that there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '2243.28'
    text: only going to be one citation here and
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '2245.24'
    text: it&amp;#39;s the citation of the actual p paper
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '2248.4'
    text: um where you got the things um I would
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '2251.16'
    text: still say you should site it somewhere
  - dur: '3.121'
    start: '2253.319'
    text: in the like in either in the
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '2254.8'
    text: introduction or in the conclusions and
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '2256.44'
    text: say you know this and that study did
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '2258.44'
    text: this you know
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '2260.48'
    text: you this one either have the one or CH
  - dur: '6.801'
    start: '2264.079'

    text: six-page paper or whatever Accord that
  - dur: '4.281'

    text: itself is you sort of often just sort of
  - dur: '3.88'

    text: like you print it for the conference and
  - dur: '3.319'
    start: '2440.8'
    text: then you just use it to discuss at the
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '2442.52'
    text: conference and then it&amp;#39;s not going to go

  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '2511.839'
    text: before it goes because it&amp;#39;s often like

    start: '2514.56'
    text: you put you put the poster together and
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '2516.28'

    text: chance to kind of go through it with
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '2529.64'
    text: your peers before you&amp;#39;re doing it in
  - dur: '5.881'
    start: '2531.599'
    text: person um it is also just absolutely
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '2535.48'
    text: standard experience that when you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '2537.48'
    text: presenting a poster for the first time
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '2539.599'
    text: the first couple people that you present
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '2541.319'
    text: it to get the worst version of the story
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '2545.839'
    text: and generally speaking speaking by the
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '2547.839'
    text: end of the session which you know for a
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '2550.079'
    text: lot of conferences can be like you know
  - dur: '8.04'
    start: '2551.44'
    text: 3 4 hours rather long time
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '2555.559'
    text: um you have by by the end of that poster
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '2559.48'
    text: session you have the story of your
  - dur: '6'
    start: '2561.359'
    text: research so down like so perfectly down
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '2565.559'
    text: that it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '2567.359'
    text: like if you ever find yourself going to
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '2569.96'
    text: a conference and presenting a poster I
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '2572.96'
    text: beg of you to do yourself the favor of
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '2575.44'
    text: taking notes voice notes text notes
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '2578.4'
    text: whatever you can about what you&amp;#39;ve been
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '2580.8'
    text: talking about in your poster like the
  - dur: '3.2'
    start: '2583.119'
    text: moment the poster session is done
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '2584.92'
    text: because the story that you&amp;#39;re trying to
  - dur: '6.121'
    start: '2586.319'
    text: tell will never be clearer in your mind
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '2589.04'
    text: than it will be after you have pulled it
  - dur: '5.919'
    start: '2592.44'
    text: you know however many dozens of times
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '2594.76'
    text: you do um and that&amp;#39;s another like within
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '2598.359'
    text: the context of like how science operates
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '2600.92'
    text: and sort of a practical communal sense
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '2603.28'
    text: that is often the purpose of a poster
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '2605.04'
    text: session um not always the case but
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '2608.16'
    text: generally the case posters and also
  - dur: '2.761'
    start: '2611.119'
    text: talks like most of the times when you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '2.88'
    start: '2612.8'
    text: when you&amp;#39;re presenting stuff at a
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '2613.88'
    text: conference it&amp;#39;s stuff that you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '2615.68'
    text: working on it&amp;#39;s not stuff that&amp;#39;s you you
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '2619.4'
    text: typically I mean it sort of depends on
  - dur: '3.881'
    start: '2621.359'
    text: the cycle but you I think if if you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '2623.359'
    text: really using the conference to its
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '2625.24'
    text: fullest extent you should be presenting
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '2627.559'
    text: stuff that&amp;#39;s not quite done yet it&amp;#39;s not
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '2629.8'
    text: ready for prime time it&amp;#39;s not published
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '2631.68'
    text: it&amp;#39;s not peer-reviewed it&amp;#39;s the paper
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '2633.76'
    text: that you&amp;#39;re currently writing not the
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '2635.359'
    text: one that you just published um because
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '2637.88'
    text: this poster session the poster session
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2640.28'
    text: in particular is a really great
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '2641.92'
    text: opportunity to like hone the story that
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '2644.8'
    text: you&amp;#39;re telling um and when you know and
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '2647.76'
    text: ask questions someone you know say oh
  - dur: '3.319'
    start: '2649.52'
    text: yeah we use this method I&amp;#39;m kind of I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '3.119'
    start: '2651'
    text: new to this and someone&amp;#39;s going to come
  - dur: '2.76'
    start: '2652.839'
    text: by and like oh I actually know that
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '2654.119'
    text: method quite well and then you can ask
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '2655.599'
    text: them that question when it comes up um
  - dur: '2.88'
    start: '2658.4'
    text: you know you might have a certain way of
  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '2659.8'
    text: saying it that like the first couple
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '2661.28'
    text: times you do it people don&amp;#39;t really get
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '2662.92'
    text: it and then you figure out some turn of
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '2664.8'
    text: phrase that makes everyone go oh right
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '2667.24'
    text: now I see what&amp;#39;s going on and that&amp;#39;s the
  - dur: '3.399'
    start: '2669.16'
    text: way that you want to describe it like
  - dur: '3.04'
    start: '2670.96'
    text: you know when you&amp;#39;re describing the
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '2672.559'
    text: methods like you know you&amp;#39;ll you&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '2674'
    text: often this is this is absolutely the
  - dur: '4'
    start: '2676.64'
    text: most classic student behavior that ever
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '2678.24'
    text: exists you&amp;#39;ll describe it in way too
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '2680.64'
    text: much detail um and then eventually
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '2683.52'
    text: you&amp;#39;ll learn all the details that you
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '2685.04'
    text: can leave out that help people
  - dur: '3.361'
    start: '2687.359'
    text: understand what it is with with the

    start: '2721.92'
    text: the stupid thing stopped leaking out and
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '2723.88'
    text: they kept using there some thing that
  - dur: '2.519'
    start: '2726.04'
    text: wasn&amp;#39;t working and they figured out the
  - dur: '2.52'
    start: '2727.28'
    text: glue and then blah blah blah blah blah
  - dur: '3.121'
    start: '2728.559'
    text: and like that&amp;#39;s and then when they
  - dur: '3.759'
    start: '2729.8'
    text: actually got it working the data just
  - dur: '3.08'
    start: '2731.68'
    text: kind of fell out of it and so when they
  - dur: '3.04'
    start: '2733.559'
    text: give the presentation they&amp;#39;re going to
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '2734.76'
    text: spend the first half of the conversation
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '2736.599'
    text: talking about all the glue that they had
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '2738.2'
    text: to use and how the the leak you know how
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '2740.559'
    text: they sort of got the the water up to the
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '2742.359'
    text: right level and da da da da da that
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '2745.319'
    text: stuff shouldn&amp;#39;t even be a part of the
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '2746.92'
    text: conversation you just that part off
  - dur: '2.68'
    start: '2751.24'
    text: sometimes when I&amp;#39;m giving a presentation
  - dur: '3.481'
    start: '2752.559'
    text: I&amp;#39;ll just say in this slide transition
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '2753.92'
    text: was 6 months of my life and then I just
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '2756.04'
    text: show the result where it worked and not
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '2758.76'
    text: the 15 iterations of failed attempts
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '2761.079'
    text: that I had to do before I got the
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '2762.359'
    text: version that works
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '2764.92'
    text: um if the things that you were doing to
  - dur: '3.359'
    start: '2767.48'
    text: make it work are interesting you might
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '2769.04'
    text: want to record them in another place but
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '2770.839'
    text: a poster is almost never that time um
  - dur: '2.72'
    start: '2773.839'
    text: and then that might be the case where
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '2774.8'
    text: someone comes along go how&amp;#39;d you get
  - dur: '3.321'
    start: '2776.559'
    text: your stupid thing to fill up because
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '2778.04'
    text: ours keeps leaking that&amp;#39;s when you can
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '2779.88'
    text: say oh yeah we use this glue and not the
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '2781.44'
    text: other glue and that&amp;#39;s the place where
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '2783.28'
    text: like at the end of the paper that you
  - dur: '2.839'
    start: '2785.72'
    text: wind up publishing on it you can have
  - dur: '2.92'
    start: '2787.04'
    text: the very long methods where you can have
  - dur: '3.401'
    start: '2788.559'
    text: a little section about why you have to
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '2789.96'
    text: use this glue and not the other glue and
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '2791.96'
    text: da da da da um yeah so it&amp;#39;s the process
  - dur: '6.401'
    start: '2795.079'
    text: of kind of distillation that I think is
  - dur: '6.8'
    start: '2797.319'
    text: really the nut of this assignment um and
  - dur: '6.119'
    start: '2801.48'
    text: it is your job as the sort of the
  - dur: '5'
    start: '2804.119'
    text: ambassador of This research study to to
  - dur: '3.041'
    start: '2807.599'
    text: to make the call to make the Judgment
  - dur: '3.2'
    start: '2809.119'
    text: call about what what&amp;#39;s the most
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '2810.64'
    text: important part and what&amp;#39;s the narrative
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '2812.319'
    text: that we&amp;#39;re going to try to pursue here
  - dur: '7.081'
    start: '2821.559'
    text: okay
  - dur: '7.2'
    start: '2823.96'
    text: yeah right we good cool
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '2828.64'
    text: um yeah and we will have plenty more
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '2831.16'
    text: opportunity to talk about this stuff in
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '2833.079'
    text: your specific case but
  - dur: '6.199'
    start: '2837.64'
    text: um
  - dur: '8.679'
    start: '2840.16'
    text: cool all right now with all of that
  - dur: '8.681'
    start: '2843.839'
    text: said let us just let&amp;#39;s go and look at at
  - dur: '6.121'
    start: '2848.839'
    text: a paper and let&amp;#39;s see so we have
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '2852.52'
    text: approximately 40 minutes
  - dur: '6.399'
    start: '2854.96'
    text: left and I am going to attempt to do to
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '2859'
    text: look at two separate papers which is a
  - dur: '5.801'
    start: '2861.359'
    text: terrible idea because I&amp;#39;ve already done
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '2865.28'
    text: the thing of saying this is going to
  - dur: '6.199'
    start: '2867.16'
    text: have an and in the lecture
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '2870.64'
    text: um and I love the papers I&amp;#39;m talking
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '2873.359'
    text: about and I&amp;#39;m going to want to dive
  - dur: '6.119'
    start: '2874.96'
    text: deeply into them um
  - dur: '6'
    start: '2878.119'
    text: but I think it&amp;#39;s fun to do the the quick
  - dur: '5.721'
    start: '2881.079'
    text: run through so we&amp;#39;ll do that and I&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '2884.119'
    text: try to keep myself to a particular time
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '2886.8'
    text: um I will also finish up a thought I
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '2889.52'
    text: meant to have like half an hour ago
  - dur: '6.119'
    start: '2891.44'
    text: wishes uh after we do this sort of aside
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '2895'
    text: around the the papers and the assignment
  - dur: '6.201'
    start: '2897.559'
    text: and the exam like object um we&amp;#39;re going
  - dur: '6.041'
    start: '2900.119'
    text: to transition into Vision stuff um like
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '2903.76'
    text: eyeballs and I&amp;#39;ll bring in an eye
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '2906.16'
    text: tracker and we sort of like talk more
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '2908'
    text: about visual Neuroscience I record semit
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '2909.68'
    text: tracking data of like go through it to
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '2911.76'
    text: the similar to how we did before um it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '2.84'
    start: '2914.92'
    text: going to be a bit of a different vibe
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '2916.64'
    text: there just because the nature of the
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '2917.76'
    text: equipment and the data but um we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '8.679'
    start: '2919.92'
    text: going to do Vision stuff um
  - dur: '7.361'
    start: '2923.839'
    text: which yeah is always fun
  - dur: '5'
    start: '2928.599'
    text: uh yeah vision and specifically eye
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '2931.2'
    text: movements um which
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '2933.599'
    text: are technically a part of motor control
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '2936.48'
    text: because it involves muscles but sort of
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '2939.76'
    text: a interesting space
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '2942.64'
    text: there
  - dur: '6.199'
    start: '2945.4'
    text: okay so in 20 minutes or less which will
  - dur: '7.839'
    start: '2949.76'
    text: put us at
  - dur: '6'
    start: '2951.599'
    text: 410 uh I&amp;#39;m going to look up
  - dur: '4'
    start: '2968'
    text: so C
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '3010.599'

    text: volary there we go 2012
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3087.4'
    text: this used to be a new study now it&amp;#39;s old
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '3090.68'
    text: that&amp;#39;s not that old it&amp;#39;s just over a
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '3092.4'
    text: decade at this point so
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3095.4'
    text: I just for so this is a paper published
  - dur: '3'
    start: '3098.079'
    text: in science which is one of the bigger
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '3099.4'
    text: journals out there there sort of there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '3101.079'
    text: two journals which are sort of like
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '3103.799'
    text: categorically the biggest journals
  - dur: '6.679'
    start: '3105.92'
    text: biggest and most prestigious science and
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '3108.2'
    text: nature um that sort of cultural reality
  - dur: '3'
    start: '3112.599'
    text: of there being a biggest thing is
  - dur: '3.039'
    start: '3114.04'
    text: generally toxic and leads to a lot of
  - dur: '3.281'
    start: '3115.599'
    text: bad outcomes but
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '3117.079'
    text: nonetheless uh if you see something
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '3118.88'
    text: published in science or nature that&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '3121.48'
    text: good study good and prestigious study um
  - dur: '3.879'
    start: '3125.48'
    text: generally speaking the more generic the
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '3127.92'
    text: name of the journal is the more
  - dur: '6'
    start: '3129.359'
    text: prestigious it is so the Portuguese
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3132.559'
    text: study of ankle Prosthetics research is
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '3135.359'
    text: generally going to be lower Prestige
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '3137.559'
    text: than you know Journal of Prosthetics
  - dur: '2.919'
    start: '3139.92'
    text: which is going to be lower prestige in
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '3141.079'
    text: Journal of biology which is going to
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '3142.839'
    text: which so science and nature are about as
  - dur: '4.479'
    start: '3145.64'
    text: big as you can get in that space Also
  - dur: '3.43'
    start: '3147.72'
    text: cell is a very good one for
  - dur: '2.361'
    start: '3150.119'
    text: biology
  - dur: '4.81'
    start: '3151.15'
    text: '[Music]'
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '3152.48'

    start: '3158.96'
    text: fun we&amp;#39;re going to go to

    text: reader thing so turn that off so it
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '3175.52'
    text: looks like it would normally
  - dur: '7.32'
    start: '3177.2'
    text: look okay and I have 15 some OD minutes

    start: '3184.839'
    text: this I probably won get to a second
  - dur: '2.24'
    start: '3187.079'
    text: we&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '3195.119'
    text: see
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '3196.68'
    text: okay so this is kind of normal um the
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '3199.92'
    text: when you download the PDF the front page
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '3201.599'
    text: is just kind of like info about the
  - dur: '6.439'
    start: '3204.16'
    text: thing um title
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '3207.16'
    text: arti artist author list Journal at all

    start: '3210.599'
    text: means there&amp;#39;s more of them um and
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '3213.92'
    text: there&amp;#39;s links here to things like
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '3215.52'
    text: supporting material supporting online
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '3217.52'
    text: material other things that site this
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3220.28'
    text: article sites um with modern papers
  - dur: '3.201'
    start: '3223.319'
    text: typically there&amp;#39;s going to be
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '3224.28'
    text: supplemental data or supplemental data
  - dur: '7.839'
    start: '3226.52'
    text: supplemental methods and stuff like that
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '3230.52'
    text: um modern contemporary Journal articles
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '3234.359'
    text: are tend to have very very constrained
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '3236.76'
    text: lengths um so the core studies are
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '3239.64'
    text: typically going to be quite short um
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '3241.839'
    text: unless it&amp;#39;s like a Journal Review or
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '3243.599'
    text: like an older you know that all varies
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '3245.68'
    text: very much by um by Journal um so to kind
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '3249.119'
    text: of get around that they&amp;#39;ll often have
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '3251.64'
    text: these like supplemental stuff so like
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '3254.04'
    text: either something like the methods will
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '3255.599'
    text: not be a part of the word count and or
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '3258.68'
    text: um you have the opportunity to present
  - dur: '7'
    start: '3260.16'
    text: additional data there
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '3263.88'
    text: um and
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '3267.16'
    text: yeah

    text: so so what I&amp;#39;m going to do now with this
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '3271.799'
    text: study because I know this study quite
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '3273.28'
    text: well uh I&amp;#39;m going to try to give you
  - dur: '5.959'
    start: '3277.16'
    text: something like a very high level
  - dur: '7.08'
    start: '3278.96'
    text: overview of this paper that ideally will
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '3283.119'
    text: both be fast enough that I can do it in
  - dur: '4.039'
    start: '3286.04'
    text: the next 15 minutes um comprehensible
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '3288.72'
    text: enough that you&amp;#39;ll be able to follow the
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '3290.079'
    text: story despite not being sort of
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '3292.559'
    text: particularly trained in this area um and
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '3296.559'
    text: ideally a sort of fair and honest
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '3299.319'
    text: representation of what was actually
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '3300.72'
    text: being done so that if you were to take
  - dur: '3.559'
    start: '3303.28'
    text: the time so sort of read this paper in
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '3305.4'
    text: depth and sort of get through all the
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '3306.839'
    text: nitty-gritty you would come out of it
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '3308.88'
    text: saying oh yeah everything that John said
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '3311.16'
    text: about this is an accurate representation
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3313.559'
    text: like I&amp;#39;m creating the cartoon Narrative
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '3316.28'
    text: of the study so that I can present it to
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '3318.559'
    text: you in a way that will sort of handle
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '3320.68'
    text: itself and if you became an expert on
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '3322.68'
    text: this area and on this paper ideally you
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '3325.76'
    text: would be able to evaluate my choices of
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '3328.44'
    text: cartoon ification and understand why I
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '3330.839'
    text: choosing this form of the cartoon and
  - dur: '6.759'
    start: '3333.28'
    text: not some other form of the
  - dur: '4.039'
    start: '3336'
    text: cartoon this
  - dur: '9.52'
    start: '3340.96'
    text: so so yeah so this is a study about the
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '3346.76'
    text: spinal cord and particular it&amp;#39;s looking
  - dur: '6.119'
    start: '3350.48'
    text: at spinal cord injury and trying to get
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '3353.48'
    text: at something like a what has been a sort
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '3356.599'
    text: of Holy Grail type of thing for quite
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '3358.319'
    text: some time which is the ability to heal
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '3360.64'
    text: spinal cord injuries like you you know
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '3363'
    text: you get an injur you get an accident
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '3365.039'
    text: your spinal cord is damaged and you lose
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '3369.079'
    text: control of your limbs below that area
  - dur: '3.361'
    start: '3372.079'
    text: may you might lose control of your legs
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '3374.2'
    text: you might lose control of your whole
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '3375.44'
    text: body depending on where that injury
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '3377.839'
    text: occurs and we really really would like
  - dur: '7.28'
    start: '3379.88'
    text: it if we could correct that in some way
  - dur: '6'
    start: '3383.559'
    text: um which yeah the same way that we can
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '3387.16'
    text: correct it when you break your ankle or
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '3389.559'
    text: you know damage some muscle damage some
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '3391.119'
    text: skin we would love to be able to correct
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '3394.119'
    text: that on a
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '3395.72'
    text: person
  - dur: '7.48'
    start: '3397.359'
    text: um yeah so this here is the abstract of
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '3401.92'
    text: the paper um again different journals
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '3404.839'
    text: will sort of format this in different
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '3406.24'
    text: ways this one&amp;#39;s not even labeling it as
  - dur: '3.319'
    start: '3408.52'
    text: the abstract they kind of assume that
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '3409.839'
    text: you know that um but sometimes it might
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '3411.839'
    text: be called a summary sometimes it might
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '3413.359'
    text: be called something else um I know
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '3416.28'
    text: noticed that
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '3418.559'
    text: on yeah so on the actual website they&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '6'
    start: '3422.16'
    text: giving a sort of a high level summary in
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '3425.079'
    text: addition to the abstract
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '3428.16'
    text: um but yeah all the information should
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '3430.319'
    text: rly speaking be
  - dur: '6.599'
    start: '3431.76'
    text: there
  - dur: '7.799'
    start: '3434'
    text: um so this study Builds on so this study
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '3438.359'
    text: so the the application is for uh is in
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '3441.799'
    text: the space of trying to sort of heal
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '3443.039'
    text: spinal cord injury um but this study is
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '3446.48'
    text: not looking at patient populations
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3449.359'
    text: they&amp;#39;re not looking at people who have
  - dur: '7.081'
    start: '3450.799'
    text: spinal cord injuries um they are looking
  - dur: '6.121'
    start: '3453.359'
    text: specifically at rats um and this is
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '3457.88'
    text: where like if you look at any so these
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '3459.48'
    text: numbers here are the citations and if
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '3461.48'
    text: you scroll to the the end of the paper
  - dur: '5.439'
    start: '3463.88'
    text: uh they will correspond to the actual
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '3466.64'
    text: citations there um these are in science
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '3469.319'
    text: format um sometimes you&amp;#39;ll see citations
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '3472.039'
    text: where it&amp;#39;s like author year so it&amp;#39;s like
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3474.16'
    text: you know Mathis edel 2019 or something
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '3476.72'
    text: like that that&amp;#39;s APA format this is a
  - dur: '6'
    start: '3479.16'
    text: more engineering style literally just
  - dur: '6.399'
    start: '3481.4'
    text: because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s made to be shorter
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '3485.16'
    text: um
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '3487.799'
    text: and see if you look at these citations
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '3490.319'
    text: they will be referencing clinical
  - dur: '3.879'
    start: '3492.68'
    text: studies and medical studies and things
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '3494.48'
    text: like that um but they are not themselves
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '3496.559'
    text: doing research on humans this is a this
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '3499.72'
    text: is an application with a basic science
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '3502.4'
    text: sort of motivation where they&amp;#39;re trying
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '3504.079'
    text: to have a theoretical they&amp;#39;re trying to
  - dur: '3.121'
    start: '3506.559'
    text: increase theoretical understanding but
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '3508'
    text: they&amp;#39;re doing it in service of being
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '3509.68'
    text: able to move towards this applied
  - dur: '9.44'
    start: '3512.119'
    text: goal
  - dur: '9.799'
    start: '3514.28'
    text: um and they are building on a history of
  - dur: '5.881'
    start: '3521.559'
    text: studies of
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '3524.079'
    text: um studying Central pattern gener spinal
  - dur: '6.119'
    start: '3527.44'
    text: Central pattern generators in mammals um
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '3530.799'
    text: those Central pattern generators exist
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '3533.559'
    text: in pretty much all animals
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '3536.839'
    text: not not necessarily all animals but many
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '3539.16'
    text: many animals um and they they generally
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '3543.559'
    text: refer to neural
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '3545.48'
    text: architectures that generate rhythmic
  - dur: '6.041'
    start: '3549.119'
    text: Activation so it&amp;#39;s some sort of like a
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '3551.839'
    text: metronome type of activ of activity uh
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '3555.16'
    text: which is the basis of a lot of motor
  - dur: '7.921'
    start: '3557.599'
    text: behavior and
  - dur: '5.961'
    start: '3559.559'
    text: just um General life so let&amp;#39;s see so
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '3570.76'
    text: so this is a really fun animation of a
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '3574.24'
    text: ant walking alternating tripod gate so
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '3577.28'
    text: the red or one tripod blue or another
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '3579.839'
    text: tripod that&amp;#39;s how insects operate and
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '3581.96'
    text: that&amp;#39;s a rhythmic

    start: '3583.92'
    text: Behavior breathing is a rhythmic

    start: '3585.92'
    text: Behavior most forms of locomotion ayic

    start: '3588.359'
    text: Behavior flapping is a rhythmic Behavior
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '3590.319'
    text: it&amp;#39;s the kind of thing that is present
  - dur: '8.64'
    start: '3592.64'
    text: down to invertebrates like insects and
  - dur: '9'
    start: '3595.4'
    text: also present up to mammals like us and
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '3601.28'
    text: um spinal cpg
  - dur: '3'
    start: '3604.4'
    text: cat
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '3608.079'
    text: uh and this particular study is
  - dur: '8.24'
    start: '3610.359'
    text: following a particular sort of
  - dur: '6.559'
    start: '3613.28'
    text: branch of um of ways of studying that
  - dur: '3.281'
    start: '3618.599'
    text: idea of central pendon where
  - dur: '2.921'
    start: '3619.839'
    text: specifically as they exist in the spines
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '3621.88'
    text: of
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '3622.76'
    text: invertebrates um because it&amp;#39;s kind of
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '3625.039'
    text: this like there&amp;#39;s a general question
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3627.16'
    text: around like we know that cpgs are
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '3629.4'
    text: present in lower animals we can study
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '3631.16'
    text: them very carefully in those animals um
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '3634.72'
    text: because they&amp;#39;re simpler and you know we
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '3636.319'
    text: can sort of open them up and sort of see
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '3637.88'
    text: these things happening um but then the
  - dur: '3.121'
    start: '3641.359'
    text: question kind of arises like what is the
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '3642.96'
    text: role of these types of neural
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '3644.48'
    text: architectures in more complex animals
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '3646.64'
    text: like mammals who have many many many
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '3648.72'
    text: more neurons and have many many many or
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '3651.079'
    text: mag more complex behaviors um but still
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '3654.119'
    text: have the same sort of evolutionary
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '3655.359'
    text: history um so this is a a a video which
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '3658.359'
    text: is quite old and kind of from an era
  - dur: '6.88'
    start: '3661.52'
    text: sort of a different era of like animal
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '3663.48'
    text: rights I&amp;#39;ll say um so this shows a cat
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '3668.4'
    text: that has
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '3669.359'
    text: been uh
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '3671.96'
    text: decerebrated um so it&amp;#39;s hard to see but
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '3674.24'
    text: this is this is the cat and it&amp;#39;s being
  - dur: '9.879'
    start: '3676.24'
    text: supported by these liars and this cat
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '3679.079'
    text: has had its spine SED here so from
  - dur: '2.76'
    start: '3697.839'
    text: so let&amp;#39;s see how you
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '3704.799'
    text: drop so that&amp;#39;s the brain and then that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.721'
    start: '3708.039'
    text: the cerebellum and that&amp;#39;s their spine
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '3711.079'
    text: and then these are the
  - dur: '7.599'
    start: '3713.76'
    text: legs and I think for this era they would
  - dur: '6.321'
    start: '3717.839'
    text: sever the spine there so they they
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '3721.359'
    text: surgically cut the spinal cord so that
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '3724.16'
    text: there is no information going from the
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3727.119'
    text: legs to the brain and no information
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '3728.92'
    text: going from the brain to the legs um and
  - dur: '7.041'
    start: '3732.119'
    text: so the legs are still connected to the
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '3734.279'
    text: spinal cord here um and then kind of the
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '3739.16'
    text: interesting result here is that if the
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '3741.119'
    text: cat is supported and walking on a
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '3743.24'
    text: treadmill the hind limbs are still
  - dur: '6'
    start: '3745.52'
    text: walking they&amp;#39;re still doing the rhythmic
  - dur: '4.759'
    start: '3747.52'
    text: behavior of locomotion being driven by
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '3751.52'
    text: the
  - dur: '7.28'
    start: '3752.279'
    text: sensory motor Loops from the feet up
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '3756.4'
    text: through the spine and sort of back so
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '3759.559'
    text: this is kind of counter to a lot of our
  - dur: '7.68'
    start: '3761.48'
    text: intuitions about how the Spine Works um
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '3764.799'
    text: which we tend to think of it as like
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '3770.359'
    text: a there yeah um you have to think of
  - dur: '5.481'
    start: '3774.279'
    text: this just kind of like extension cables
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '3777.079'
    text: that sort of lead from like the brain
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '3779.76'
    text: down to the dumb muscles um but this
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '3782.72'
    text: type of stuff shows that there is
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3785.16'
    text: processing happening in there like your
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '3786.839'
    text: spinal cord is a part of your central
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '3789.16'
    text: nervous system and it can handle simple
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '3792.119'

    text: coming off of the feet um is enough to
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '3797.319'
    text: generate the behavior that leavs the
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '3799.72'
    text: feet to sort of like if I&amp;#39;m being pushed
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '3801.92'
    text: backwards at a certain point I should
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '3803.4'
    text: lift up go forward and come down again
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '3806.079'
    text: and the two limbs are sort of
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '3807.72'
    text: reciprocally activated by Central
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '3809.599'
    text: pattern generators in the spine and so
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '3811.839'
    text: that not only can the cat walk um
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '3814.2'
    text: despite having no cerebral implant to
  - dur: '5.961'
    start: '3816.559'
    text: their spine to the back legs as the as
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '3819.52'
    text: the treadmill speeds up they speed up
  - dur: '6.88'
    start: '3822.52'
    text: with it um which is just sort
  - dur: '6.879'
    start: '3825.4'
    text: of chew on that you seem
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '3829.4'
    text: perturbed it just feels wrong yeah yeah
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '3832.279'
    text: yeah yeah uh it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a wild
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '3835'
    text: result just to be clear and it
  - dur: '8.68'
    start: '3837.2'
    text: absolutely is baffling in many layers
  - dur: '8.92'
    start: '3840.24'
    text: and levels um but and probably is when I
  - dur: '7.08'
    start: '3845.88'
    text: like to study so much
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '3849.16'
    text: um and it&amp;#39;s kind of like you know as is
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '3852.96'
    text: often the
  - dur: '3'
    start: '3854.839'
    text: case
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '3858.16'
    text: um it&amp;#39;s those parts of the empirical
  - dur: '3.321'
    start: '3861.319'
    text: investigation where you go oh wait
  - dur: '3.399'
    start: '3862.96'
    text: that&amp;#39;s not what I was expecting we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5.479'
    start: '3864.64'
    text: often the best
  - dur: '6'
    start: '3866.359'
    text: investigations live um because despite
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '3870.119'
    text: how strange that is uh I&amp;#39;m giving up on
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '3872.359'
    text: the second paper we&amp;#39;re going to focus on
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3873.76'
    text: this one um for the rest of the class uh
  - dur: '3.04'
    start: '3876.16'
    text: we&amp;#39;ll talk about the next one the next
  - dur: '3.519'
    start: '3877.76'
    text: one about dragon flies we&amp;#39;ll talk about
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '3879.2'
    text: that once we&amp;#39;ve done more Vision stuff
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '3881.279'
    text: about vision and dragon flies we&amp;#39;ll get
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '3882.76'
    text: there
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '3885.319'
    text: um
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '3887.16'
    text: so so yeah so the
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '3891.079'
    text: um so despite that being a sort of
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '3893.76'
    text: strange and baffling study um um it has
  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '3896.64'
    text: it&amp;#39;s also venerable like it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s been
  - dur: '2.76'
    start: '3898.4'
    text: around for a while we&amp;#39;ve known about
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '3899.76'
    text: this for a while that there are these
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '3901.16'
    text: Central pattern generators that govern
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '3903.359'
    text: movement and they handle like things
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '3905.119'
    text: like the basic trade-offs between you
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '3907.16'
    text: know the limbs going from stance to
  - dur: '6.441'
    start: '3908.799'
    text: swing and stuff like that um and so
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '3912.72'
    text: there&amp;#39;s been active areas of research
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '3915.24'
    text: since then trying to understand the
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '3917'
    text: nature of these spinal cpgs and trying
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '3919.079'
    text: to understand like you know where they
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '3922.079'
    text: how they operate and sort of what the
  - dur: '6.199'
    start: '3923.92'
    text: connection is between the brain and the
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '3927.359'
    text: and the like the upper level of the
  - dur: '4.521'
    start: '3930.119'
    text: brain and the lower level of the spine
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '3932.279'
    text: and sort of into the peripheral nerves
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '3934.64'
    text: and stuff like
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3935.88'
    text: that
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '3938'
    text: um and those Studies have evolved uh
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '3940.88'
    text: there was some point in time I&amp;#39;m not
  - dur: '6'
    start: '3942.72'
    text: really sure the exact history here uh
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '3945.799'
    text: where you know the animal rights rules
  - dur: '3.119'
    start: '3948.72'
    text: kind of
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '3949.96'
    text: evolved
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '3951.839'
    text: uh and at some point they were like
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '3955.16'
    text: don&amp;#39;t use cats for that anymore um the
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '3958.599'
    text: rules about animal ethics are
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '3960.96'
    text: interesting and complicated I&amp;#39;ll talk
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '3962.44'
    text: about them at some point um but there
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '3966'
    text: are kind of
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3967.279'
    text: like rules about like which animal
  - dur: '3.879'
    start: '3969.68'
    text: you&amp;#39;re allowed to use for which study
  - dur: '4.481'
    start: '3971.279'
    text: and there are some kind of like strange
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '3973.559'
    text: designations for like higher higher
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '3975.76'
    text: level versus lower level and typically
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '3978.599'
    text: speaking the closer you get to a
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '3980.4'
    text: humanlike animal the the the more
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '3982.52'
    text: stringent the standards are so like we
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '3984.64'
    text: do still use non human primates for
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '3986.76'
    text: Neuroscience research we don&amp;#39;t use apes
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '3989.559'
    text: and chimpanzees um but if you want to do
  - dur: '2.919'
    start: '3992.44'
    text: monkey research you have to really
  - dur: '3.239'
    start: '3993.88'
    text: really justify that you that you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '3995.359'
    text: doing research that needs to be done
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '3997.119'
    text: that it needs to be done on a non-human
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '3999.92'
    text: primate um and so at some point they you
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '4003.559'
    text: know they decided that you can&amp;#39;t do it
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '4005.319'
    text: on cats anymore so now they do similar
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '4007.039'
    text: stuff with rats so this study was done
  - dur: '3.04'
    start: '4009.559'
    text: with
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '4010.68'
    text: rats
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '4012.599'
    text: um
  - dur: '7.32'
    start: '4014.2'
    text: and this also by the way has a really
  - dur: '8.161'
    start: '4017.359'
    text: fun Ted talk about it um where Greg
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '4021.52'
    text: Lut is very very like smarmy French type
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '4025.52'
    text: of thing which is is a really good
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '4027.599'
    text: presentation um if you can get past the
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '4029.76'
    text: kind of like the Ted Talk of it all um
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4033.279'
    text: but it&amp;#39;s a good job of like telling an
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '4035'
    text: interesting story
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '4037.799'
    text: um although yeah the way he tells his
  - dur: '2.72'
    start: '4041.44'
    text: story is actually not the way I tell my
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '4042.599'
    text: story because that&amp;#39;s another sort of
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '4044.16'
    text: point to to call out here I am telling
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '4047.359'
    text: you this story as I have internalized it
  - dur: '4.239'
    start: '4049.88'
    text: like I me as a particular individual
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4052.24'
    text: human scientist with a particular
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '4054.119'
    text: background and sort of like area of the
  - dur: '3.519'
    start: '4056.76'
    text: world that I&amp;#39;m trying to make sense of
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '4058.88'
    text: when I tell you the story about this
  - dur: '3.721'
    start: '4060.279'
    text: paper it&amp;#39;s going to be different than if
  - dur: '2.719'
    start: '4062.4'
    text: the the authors of the study told you
  - dur: '2.839'
    start: '4064'
    text: this paper or if somebody with a
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '4065.119'
    text: different background and interest set
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '4066.839'
    text: were tell you the story of this paper um
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '4069.599'
    text: there&amp;#39;s this sort of context of like
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '4072.16'
    text: narrative that keeps coming up um that
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '4074.72'
    text: feels sort of
  - dur: '6.119'
    start: '4076.24'
    text: like unexpected in a sort of discussion
  - dur: '3.761'
    start: '4080.119'
    text: of like scientific empirical studies but
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '4082.359'
    text: remember this is all stuff being done by
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '4083.88'
    text: humans and we only remember stories that
  - dur: '3.401'
    start: '4086.039'
    text: make sense to us um and so I&amp;#39;m going to
  - dur: '2.799'
    start: '4088.48'
    text: tell the story I&amp;#39;m going to tell you
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '4089.44'
    text: sort of highlights a particular area of
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '4091.279'
    text: this that I think is sort of I found
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '4095.08'
    text: motivating um since I gave myself a
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '4097.839'
    text: little bit more time also talk a little
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '4098.96'
    text: bit more structurally about this paper
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '4101.239'
    text: uh so these are all authors of the paper
  - dur: '6.399'
    start: '4104.44'
    text: they all contributed in some way
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '4107.759'
    text: um the the person at the front is the
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '4110.839'
    text: first author typically speaking this is
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '4112.96'
    text: like the owner of this the person who
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '4114.679'
    text: like did the work and sort of own the
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '4116.64'
    text: project generally speaking um this is
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '4119.44'
    text: going to be like a grad student or a
  - dur: '5.801'
    start: '4120.719'
    text: post do or something like that the last
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '4123'
    text: author is the often times the senior
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '4126.52'
    text: author um so generally speaking not
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '4129.04'
    text: always the case um and this does this is
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '4131.359'
    text: somewhat Fu dependent but in most like
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '4133.759'
    text: biology related neuroscience types of of
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4136.96'
    text: of studies the last author is the person
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '4139.92'
    text: who runs the lab where the study was
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '4141.88'
    text: done and the first author is the person
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '4144.12'
    text: in the lab that generally did that work
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '4146.759'
    text: um again it&amp;#39;s very it&amp;#39;s very that&amp;#39;s all
  - dur: '7.08'
    start: '4150.48'
    text: very very it varies dramatically by
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '4152.92'
    text: paper and by field and by whatnot um but
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '4157.56'
    text: if you&amp;#39;re like in grad school or a postd
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '4159.48'
    text: something like that like you they you
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '4162.12'
    text: will be considering your first author
  - dur: '3.761'
    start: '4164.279'
    text: Publications differently from your
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '4165.64'
    text: non-ir author Publications the people in
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '4168.04'
    text: the middle are people typically people
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '4169.44'
    text: that like helped out in some way um but
  - dur: '7.479'
    start: '4171.88'
    text: they were not like the owner of the
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '4174.319'
    text: study um yeah then once you get to not
  - dur: '3.041'
    start: '4179.359'
    text: once you start publishing papers and
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '4180.799'
    text: start looking doing things that involve
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '4182.4'
    text: paper publishing um people will ask you
  - dur: '2.881'
    start: '4185.759'
    text: questions about how many first author
  - dur: '2.921'
    start: '4187.199'
    text: Publications do you have versus second
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '4188.64'
    text: author Publications typically you&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '4190.12'
    text: have more second author pubs than first
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '4192.48'
    text: author pubs and then once you get to the
  - dur: '2.601'
    start: '4194.199'
    text: point where you actually are running lab
  - dur: '2.64'
    start: '4195.76'
    text: people will start asking questions about
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '4196.8'
    text: how many last author Publications you
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '4198.4'
    text: have meaning are you training people to
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '4200.4'
    text: do this work appropriately um again
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '4204.239'
    text: that&amp;#39;s very field dependent um math
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '4207.52'
    text: people when they publish math papers
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '4209.56'
    text: they publish their authors
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '4210.88'
    text: alphabetically which is wild to me um
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '4213.6'
    text: but what I&amp;#39;m describing here is like
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '4215.04'
    text: sort of like standard cultural practice
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '4217.76'
    text: in contemporary scientific
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '4221'
    text: publishing
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '4222.6'
    text: um down here you got all these little
  - dur: '3.759'
    start: '4225.44'
    text: citations showing what these numbers
  - dur: '3.121'
    start: '4227.679'
    text: correspond to so like where they&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4229.199'
    text: working most of the work with done in
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '4230.8'

    text: authoress of it but I guarantee you
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '4249.64'
    text: there was a discussion about despite
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '4251.52'
    text: them being starred who actually gets to
  - dur: '3.2'
    start: '4254.76'
    text: be first

    text: perspective um there&amp;#39;s always going to
  - dur: '4.4'

    text: be something like an acknowledgement
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '4283.28'

    text: where did the money come from like in in
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '4303.639'
    text: this case they&amp;#39;re listing a bunch of
  - dur: '7'
    start: '4305.92'
    text: Grants from uh European research
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '4309.8'
    text: councils and d d this is an expensive St
  - dur: '4.759'
    start: '4312.92'
    text: there a bunch of Grants but it&amp;#39;s sort of
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4314.719'
    text: a you know there&amp;#39;s always going to be
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '4317.679'
    text: something saying thanks to the NIH for
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4319.719'
    text: giving me this grant or whatever um and
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '4322.8'
    text: typically uh this is another place where
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '4325.239'
    text: like you say hey thanks for giving me
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '4327.28'
    text: this Grant and you tell you say this is
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4329.44'
    text: this is you know Grant number is this so
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '4331.719'
    text: you can for public grants which most of
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '4334.36'
    text: these are you can go on you can go look
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '4336.679'
    text: up the grant that was written to fund
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '4339.04'
    text: This research and sort of see what they
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4340.719'
    text: were talking about there so it&amp;#39;s just
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '4342.44'
    text: kind of another way that people kind of
  - dur: '3.201'
    start: '4345.239'
    text: keep connected to the larger uh
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '4347.32'
    text: Community when they&amp;#39;re publishing
  - dur: '2.4'
    start: '4348.44'
    text: particular
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4351.28'
    text: papers
  - dur: '6.319'
    start: '4356.84'
    text: um yeah modern papers also tend to talk
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '4360.679'
    text: they have a like a of like very like
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '4363.159'
    text: more recent than 2012 you&amp;#39;ll it&amp;#39;s more
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '4365.52'
    text: common to see uh sections that say that
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '4369.08'
    text: list out what each author did so like
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '4371'
    text: this person helped collect the data this
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '4372.32'
    text: person wrote the thing and there&amp;#39;ll be a
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '4374.679'
    text: a paragraph or two saying what each
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4377.639'
    text: author actually did when they were like
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '4380.04'
    text: how do they earn their spot on the on
  - dur: '2.48'
    start: '4382.159'
    text: the author
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '4385.12'
    text: list okay
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '4387.96'
    text: so this particular
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '4390.48'
    text: study
  - dur: '8.32'
    start: '4392.08'
    text: um this is your figure one figure one
  - dur: '6.839'
    start: '4396.4'
    text: this style of figure is very common in
  - dur: '4.759'
    start: '4400.4'
    text: like science and nature um journals
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '4403.239'
    text: because science and nature journals are
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '4405.159'
    text: very very short and very very dense this
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '4407.92'
    text: is also
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '4409.44'
    text: specifically um a report um which is you
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '4413'
    text: know generally speaking the journal will
  - dur: '3.119'
    start: '4415.12'
    text: have like oh we have articles which are
  - dur: '3.361'
    start: '4416.639'
    text: full length and like report which is
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4418.239'
    text: short length and you know brief
  - dur: '2.76'
    start: '4420'
    text: communication which is some other length
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '4421.239'
    text: and it&amp;#39;s just so this is a report which
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '4422.76'
    text: is like this the T it&amp;#39;s not the longest
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '4426.12'
    text: format it&amp;#39;s the second it&amp;#39;s like a a
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '4427.92'
    text: shorter form and this whole this whole
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4430.48'
    text: study is five pages
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4433.6'
    text: including uh the this front page so it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '4436'
    text: only four written pages of text and then
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '4438.52'
    text: probably if you go to those supplemental
  - dur: '3.079'
    start: '4440.12'
    text: documents it&amp;#39;s going to be when you go
  - dur: '2.92'
    start: '4441.84'
    text: to the supplemental stuff it&amp;#39;s typically
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '4443.199'
    text: going to look like a Microsoft Word
  - dur: '6.479'
    start: '4444.76'
    text: document converted to PDF and it&amp;#39;s going
  - dur: '8.56'
    start: '4446.84'
    text: to be dozens to possibly more um
  - dur: '8.081'
    start: '4451.239'
    text: Pages um but this study yeah so this
  - dur: '8.64'
    start: '4455.4'
    text: picture with very dense with like letter
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '4459.32'
    text: um sort of sub panels um in particular
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '4464.04'
    text: with this kind of like professional
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '4465.76'
    text: looking animation sort of or
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '4468.32'
    text: visualization here very indicative of
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '4470.88'
    text: this type of Journal um if you go to
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '4473.639'
    text: sort of more like standard bread and
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '4475.36'
    text: butter types of journals like anything
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '4477.44'
    text: that&amp;#39;s like Journal of like biomechanics
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '4479.6'
    text: Journal of blank um the the the the
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '4483.32'
    text: figures will generally look more like a
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4485.32'
    text: real regular human made them rather than
  - dur: '9.361'
    start: '4487.639'
    text: like a professional Graphics design team
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '4490.36'
    text: which in this case is what happens um
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '4502.88'
    text: so yeah and then
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '4507.6'
    text: um when I&amp;#39;m looking at a new paper uh I
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '4510.88'
    text: will look at the title I&amp;#39;ll look at
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '4513.84'
    text: roughly speaking who wrote it like not
  - dur: '3.2'
    start: '4516.08'
    text: the PE see if I recognize any names and
  - dur: '6.281'
    start: '4518.159'
    text: kind of just look at where they&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '6.959'
    start: '4519.28'
    text: working um I&amp;#39;ll read the abstract um and
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '4524.44'
    text: then I&amp;#39;ll kind of skim the paper and
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '4526.239'
    text: look you know start out by just looking
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '4528.28'
    text: at the figures I typically like and by
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4531.32'
    text: typically I will pretty much never just
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '4534.36'
    text: like sit down with a new paper and just
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '4536.36'
    text: read it from start to finish like it&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '4538.199'
    text: novel like that&amp;#39;s just not how we tend
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4541.08'
    text: to interrogate scientific papers usually
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '4544.04'
    text: it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s kind of like jpeg compression
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '4546.6'
    text: like you do a you do skims at different
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '4548.8'
    text: levels and you kind of because you want
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4550.32'
    text: to have the full picture and then you
  - dur: '3.239'
    start: '4552.4'
    text: can sort of like choose to to sort of to
  - dur: '2.919'
    start: '4554.32'
    text: Zone in
  - dur: '3.201'
    start: '4555.639'
    text: um to different levels of analysis to
  - dur: '6.601'
    start: '4557.239'
    text: different sort of parts of the
  - dur: '8.6'
    start: '4558.84'
    text: paper um and science is a no clickbait
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '4563.84'
    text: situation so if we&amp;#39;re if we&amp;#39;re writing a
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '4567.44'
    text: good paper the title is a summary the
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '4569.92'
    text: abstract is a summary and then the paper
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '4572.56'
    text: itself will have sort of repetitive
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '4574.48'
    text: summaries within
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '4576'
    text: it
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4578.12'
    text: um
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '4581.719'
    text: so so yeah so we&amp;#39;re going to look at
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '4584.76'
    text: this this so this is figure one which
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '4587'
    text: will be referenced in the
  - dur: '8.4'
    start: '4588.96'
    text: article somewhere yeah here so figure oh
  - dur: '8.72'
    start: '4592.6'
    text: that&amp;#39;s S1 so S1 is supplemental figure
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '4597.36'
    text: um but yeah so if you this even they&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '4601.32'
    text: even they&amp;#39;re citing figures which are
  - dur: '3.479'
    start: '4603.76'
    text: not in the main article they&amp;#39;re in this
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '4605.56'
    text: only you have to go to the supplemental
  - dur: '7'
    start: '4607.239'
    text: information to get the get the results
  - dur: '7.199'
    start: '4610.52'
    text: there um but this is the first one I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '4614.239'
    text: seeing Figure 1 C represents this figure
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '4617.719'
    text: and the letter corresponds
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '4619.84'
    text: to this section here the figure will
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '4622.92'
    text: always have a caption the caption will
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '4625'
    text: always
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '4626.08'
    text: have a sort of one sentence summary of
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '4629.56'
    text: like what we&amp;#39;re looking at here and then
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '4631.96'
    text: each lettered subsection will have some
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '4635.36'
    text: little write up of what&amp;#39;s going on in
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '4636.84'
    text: that section
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4639.199'
    text: um
  - dur: '7.321'
    start: '4643.679'
    text: so yeah
  - dur: '7.321'
    start: '4646.719'
    text: um yeah so this one is kind of doing
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4651'
    text: uh like I said I think generally figure
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '4654.04'
    text: one should always be a methods figure
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '4656.52'
    text: and that you should also always or
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '4658.8'
    text: ideally have representative data this is
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '4661.08'
    text: doing both this is both a methods paper
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '4663.92'
    text: methods figure and a representation of
  - dur: '7.2'
    start: '4666.8'
    text: Representative data okay so what were
  - dur: '6'
    start: '4670.76'
    text: they actually doing here um so looking
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '4674'
    text: at stal Central pattern generators in
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '4676.76'
    text: mammals they&amp;#39;re looking at it in rats
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '4679.4'
    text: specifically or they&amp;#39;re using a rat as
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '4681.4'
    text: their model organism they don&amp;#39;t they
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '4683.28'
    text: don&amp;#39;t actually care about rats that much
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '4686.239'
    text: they&amp;#39;re but they&amp;#39;re using rats as a
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '4687.92'
    text: proxy animal that we believe has
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '4690.96'
    text: sufficient complexity that if we learn
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '4693.6'
    text: something about how supping Works in a
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '4695.08'
    text: rat that will be helpful in getting uh a
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '4698.8'
    text: treatment into humans and I happen to
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '4701'
    text: know that if you look at what this guy&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '4703.159'
    text: been up to recently they have been able
  - dur: '3.439'
    start: '4704.8'
    text: to apply this stuff in humans and I
  - dur: '2.919'
    start: '4706.8'
    text: think they are actually like getting to
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '4708.239'
    text: the point of I don&amp;#39;t know about like
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '4709.719'
    text: fully healing but I think they are

    text: injury so I I haven&amp;#39;t checked in on him
  - dur: '5.481'
    start: '4717.639'
    text: in a couple like two or three years I
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4720.44'
    text: guess so um but he&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '4723.12'
    text: like he&amp;#39;s like one of these like Mega
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4725.96'
    text: people like they if you go to sfn he has
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '4729.36'
    text: like several rows that&amp;#39;s just like a
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '4731.48'
    text: bunch of people that work in his lab
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '4732.84'
    text: because he just you know he&amp;#39;s like the
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '4735.679'
    text: it&amp;#39;s like a like a business owner type
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '4737.6'
    text: of thing so it&amp;#39;s a very very different
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '4739.639'
    text: vibe if you have like a lab with 150
  - dur: '2.801'
    start: '4742.239'
    text: people in it versus if you have a lab
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4743.679'
    text: like mine which has like three people in
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4745.04'
    text: it so uh I don&amp;#39;t want to run a lab like
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '4748.719'
    text: that that sounds
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '4750.04'
    text: terrible
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4752.4'
    text: um
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '4755.84'
    text: so the idea was so they they they they
  - dur: '7.199'
    start: '4759.48'
    text: took the M the
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '4761.32'
    text: rats and they
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4781'
    text: yeah
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '4785.8'
    text: um so they took the the rats and they
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '4789.88'
    text: they gave them a
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '4792'
    text: surgical spinal cord injury they they
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '4794.32'
    text: went to in there and they they they gave
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '4797.679'
    text: them an injury that damaged their spine
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '4800.679'
    text: and severed all the fibers going to
  - dur: '6.839'
    start: '4802.8'
    text: their brain so this is a picture of the
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '4806.52'
    text: central nervous system of a rat these
  - dur: '6.481'
    start: '4809.639'
    text: are the two loads of the brain and then
  - dur: '6.679'
    start: '4813.04'
    text: this is I&amp;#39;m not going to draw it uh but
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4816.12'
    text: this is the spinal cord itself and the
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '4819.719'
    text: idea here this is kind of like the
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '4821.12'
    text: clever part
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '4823.36'
    text: is so this is the spine they didn&amp;#39;t just
  - dur: '6.479'
    start: '4826.76'
    text: cut straight
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '4828.04'
    text: across um they did two cuts one like 60%
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '4833.239'
    text: of the
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '4834.36'
    text: way through up here and then a little
  - dur: '6'
    start: '4837.52'
    text: bit below it they cut it again going
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '4840.48'
    text: down there so all of the fibers that are
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '4843.52'
    text: going through here get severed but
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '4846.159'
    text: they&amp;#39;re not just chopping it out so
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '4849.08'
    text: there is still a sort of a path
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '4851.48'
    text: hypothetically to go through so if it
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4853.88'
    text: was possible for these fibers to kind of
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '4855.88'
    text: regrow and reform and reconnect to each
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '4857.88'
    text: other then you could theoretically have
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '4861.44'
    text: a signal coming from here and sort of
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4863.44'
    text: like bypassing these injury points and
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '4865.56'
    text: getting back up to the brain
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '4868.48'
    text: um and so the idea was that they so this
  - dur: '3.161'
    start: '4871.199'
    text: is and this is the process of sort of
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '4872.679'
    text: the decerebration part that&amp;#39;s sort of
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '4874.36'
    text: similar to what they did in the Cat
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4877.28'
    text: video um and literally it just you know
  - dur: '3.561'
    start: '4880.239'
    text: they went in there and did surgery on
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '4882.32'
    text: these rats and went in with a little
  - dur: '6.439'
    start: '4883.8'
    text: scalpel and cut them in certain areas
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '4886.8'
    text: and I&amp;#39;m sure if you go yeah adult threat
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '4890.239'
    text: received a left lateral over hem section
  - dur: '5.239'
    start: '4892.92'
    text: at thoracic T vertebrae t7 and a right
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '4895.639'
    text: lateral hem section at T10 one of those
  - dur: '2.601'
    start: '4898.159'
    text: things like if you knew what all those
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '4899.239'
    text: words meant then you would be able to
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4900.76'
    text: say oh okay I understand all the details
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '4903.44'
    text: there over hem section means a little
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '4906.28'
    text: over half so they they didn&amp;#39;t go to the
  - dur: '6.839'
    start: '4908.8'
    text: halfway point they went over
  - dur: '6.199'
    start: '4910.44'
    text: that um and so then what they do
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '4915.639'
    text: and
  - dur: '3.441'
    start: '4916.639'
    text: so see if I
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '4923.96'
    text: can uh this
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4937.8'
    text: on so now we put the mouse the rat mouse
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '4941.32'
    text: rat in this little
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '4943.32'
    text: robotic G entry system so
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '4948.44'
    text: this this is a
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '4951'
    text: uh there&amp;#39;s other studies on this
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '4953.52'
    text: particular system but this is kind of
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '4955.32'
    text: the 2012 version of that little
  - dur: '7.361'
    start: '4958.679'
    text: wire wire uh support and treadmill thing
  - dur: '8.52'
    start: '4962.28'
    text: from the cat um and so basically what
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '4966.04'
    text: they were able to do is it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4970.8'
    text: like I think this is the best picture
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4972.76'
    text: we&amp;#39;re going to get in here and actually
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '4975.32'
    text: yeah I think
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '4976.76'
    text: well the almost certainly the
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '4979'
    text: supplemental information for the paper
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '4980.96'
    text: has many many things to say about this
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4983.12'
    text: particular robotic system but basically
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '4985.8'
    text: it&amp;#39;s like a kind of like a 3D printer if
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '4988.04'
    text: you ever seen that where it&amp;#39;s kind of
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '4989.32'
    text: like a a a motor control that sort of
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '4991.96'
    text: moves over a 2d plane and then it sort
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '4994.8'
    text: of goes down to this kind of like
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '4996.28'
    text: supportive mechanism oh
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '5002'
    text: jeez and it supports the mouse of the
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '5005.28'
    text: Rat um partial body weight support so
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '5008.04'
    text: it&amp;#39;s not it&amp;#39;s not floating off the
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '5010.44'
    text: ground but it&amp;#39;s also not holding its
  - dur: '7.16'
    start: '5011.84'
    text: full body weight and and um and it
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '5015.92'
    text: allows it to turn and stuff like that
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '5019'
    text: while maintaining that body weight
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '5020.48'
    text: support so you know no matter what
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '5022.48'
    text: happens it&amp;#39;s detecting what&amp;#39;s going on
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '5024.04'
    text: and it&amp;#39;s always making sure that the rat
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '5026'
    text: has you know 10 to 20% of its body
  - dur: '6.759'
    start: '5028.48'
    text: weight on the ground the say and sure
  - dur: '5'
    start: '5031.96'
    text: enough as we are sort of not surpris to
  - dur: '5.761'
    start: '5035.239'
    text: learn
  - dur: '6.199'
    start: '5036.96'
    text: um even after so this is the the
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '5041'
    text: activity also they they hold it upright
  - dur: '4.241'
    start: '5043.159'
    text: so it walks in this kind of like bipedal
  - dur: '7.08'
    start: '5044.8'
    text: way which is sort of would be cute if it
  - dur: '9.44'
    start: '5047.4'
    text: wasn&amp;#39;t so mob um and this is what intact
  - dur: '8.16'
    start: '5051.88'
    text: means not chopped up um so the intact uh
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '5056.84'
    text: animal looks the the behavior looks like
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '5060.04'
    text: this so the trajectories in blue here
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '5062.679'
    text: are the trajectories of the feet
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '5065.52'
    text: um and this is all and they go here so
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '5068.36'
    text: we&amp;#39;re not we are not shocked to learn
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '5071.08'
    text: that um even
  - dur: '3'
    start: '5074.4'
    text: after
  - dur: '6.68'
    start: '5078.32'
    text: uh yeah that even after this injury they
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '5081.6'
    text: can still walk decently okay like if you
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '5085'
    text: put them in a little robotic thing and
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '5086.159'
    text: drag them along they can walk just fine
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '5088.28'
    text: there&amp;#39;s this complicated sort of like
  - dur: '3.121'
    start: '5090.719'
    text: electrochemical thing that they put into
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '5092.56'
    text: their spine to make sure that the
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '5093.84'
    text: neurons are still sort of active and
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '5095.96'
    text: healthy and sort of firing hard enough
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '5097.8'
    text: to move the limbs um what they found
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '5099.92'
    text: with those cats is that even like the
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '5101.96'
    text: video you saw was probably right after
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '5104.119'
    text: that surgery was done but typically what
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '5106.4'
    text: happens is the behaviors kind of
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '5108.44'
    text: extinguish over time so like after a
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '5110.84'
    text: couple of hours or days or I think not
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '5113.04'
    text: more than not more than weeks um the cat
  - dur: '2.88'
    start: '5115.88'
    text: would stop doing that behavior and if
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '5117.48'
    text: you put it back on the trebal would just
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '5118.76'
    text: kind of wind up dragging its feet um and
  - dur: '3.559'
    start: '5121.56'
    text: so one of the results that they built on
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '5123.52'
    text: from their own labs building this sort
  - dur: '3.881'
    start: '5125.119'
    text: of combination of like a pharmaceutical
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '5127'
    text: cocktail and a particular electrical
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '5129'
    text: stimulation pattern that allows them to
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '5132.04'
    text: keep the animals do like the deated
  - dur: '6.759'
    start: '5135.4'
    text: animals doing this movement for a sort
  - dur: '6.719'
    start: '5138.44'
    text: of arbitrary amount of time
  - dur: '3'
    start: '5142.159'
    text: um
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '5145.32'
    text: and
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '5147.639'
    text: uh
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '5149.56'
    text: and yeah so that&amp;#39;s I think that&amp;#39;s the
  - dur: '3.161'
    start: '5151.719'
    text: main that&amp;#39;s the setup so we&amp;#39;ve got these
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '5153.639'
    text: we&amp;#39;ve got these
  - dur: '6.239'
    start: '5154.88'
    text: they&amp;#39;ve been deated and they can do this
  - dur: '7.32'
    start: '5157.44'
    text: sort of walking task and good for
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '5161.119'
    text: them um and so now here&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4'
    start: '5164.76'
    text: where so that&amp;#39;s all cool but none of it
  - dur: '3.04'
    start: '5167.159'
    text: is shocking this is all stuff that we
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '5168.76'
    text: already knew when we showed the Cat
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '5170.199'
    text: video um so they&amp;#39;re specific thing that
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '5173.32'
    text: they&amp;#39;re trying to do is restore the
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '5175.76'
    text: animals ability to initiate walking um
  - dur: '3.241'
    start: '5179.199'
    text: so a lot of this stuff is kind of like
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '5181'
    text: they&amp;#39;re dragging it along like on a
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '5182.44'
    text: treadmill so it it gets this stimulus
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '5184.639'
    text: that it needs like the feet drag and
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '5186.36'
    text: they sort of pick then sensory signals
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '5188.8'
    text: pick up and they start taking steps um
  - dur: '4'
    start: '5191.44'
    text: but that but the the rat cannot just sit
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '5193.44'
    text: there and just decide to start walking
  - dur: '7.6'
    start: '5195.44'
    text: forward um so they&amp;#39;re trying to restore
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '5198.08'
    text: that ability to do that
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '5203.119'
    text: and this is where there&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '5206.159'
    text: lot there&amp;#39;s a lot going on here in terms
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '5208.719'
    text: of methodology that I&amp;#39;m not there&amp;#39;s just
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '5210.76'
    text: too much depth to get into but I will
  - dur: '7.84'
    start: '5212.76'
    text: say that they then they broke the
  - dur: '7.84'
    start: '5215.44'
    text: animals up into two groups um one of the
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '5220.6'
    text: animals one of the groups of animals was
  - dur: '5.439'
    start: '5223.28'
    text: getting
  - dur: '6'
    start: '5224.92'
    text: the um the control condition I guess
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '5228.719'
    text: which was training so they they would
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '5230.92'
    text: they would do this surgery to them they
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '5232.52'
    text: would give them this Electro chemical
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '5234.48'
    text: prosthetic that allows them to sort of
  - dur: '3'
    start: '5236'
    text: keep walking and then they would put
  - dur: '2.681'
    start: '5237.639'
    text: them in this sort of robotic suit and
  - dur: '2.8'
    start: '5239'
    text: they would have them do this like
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '5240.32'
    text: movement training so it take a bunch of
  - dur: '5.439'
    start: '5241.8'
    text: steps in a bunch you know in a row um
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '5244.92'
    text: then the other group and this is where I
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '5247.239'
    text: think the main sort of like interesting
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '5249.36'
    text: nut of the paper comes in the other
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '5251.679'
    text: group would do a matched amount of
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '5253.679'
    text: training so a matched amount of steps
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '5256.199'
    text: but before they would start the robot
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '5259.52'
    text: thing pulling them forward they would
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '5261.679'
    text: put chocolate in front of their face and
  - dur: '3.361'
    start: '5264.679'
    text: apparently rats like chocolate and so
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '5266.6'
    text: they put the chocolate in front of their
  - dur: '5'
    start: '5268.04'
    text: face and the r goes oh I really
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '5269.92'
    text: want the chocolate and then the robot
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '5273.04'
    text: kind of pulls them forward and then they
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '5274.8'
    text: do the stepping behavior and then they
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '5277'
    text: get to eat the chocolate that was sort
  - dur: '5.481'
    start: '5279.119'
    text: of presented to them so now we have two
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '5281.96'
    text: match groups of rats one is being
  - dur: '4.039'
    start: '5284.6'
    text: trained and taking a bunch of steps with
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '5286'
    text: this robotic Gantry system the other is
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '5288.639'
    text: doing the exact same behaviors but they
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '5291.6'
    text: are
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '5292.56'
    text: being given a motivating a motivating
  - dur: '4.759'
    start: '5295.48'
    text: food thing then they do the exact same
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '5297.92'
    text: steps and they receive the food as a
  - dur: '5.761'
    start: '5300.239'
    text: reward for doing that and in the last 2
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '5303.84'
    text: minutes of class if you sort of dig into
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '5306'
    text: all of this stuff what happens is that
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '5308.44'
    text: the animals that only do the base
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '5310.32'
    text: training don&amp;#39;t get better and eventually
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '5313.36'
    text: they the behavior still becomes
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '5315.239'
    text: extinguished and they sort of they never
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '5316.88'
    text: regain that capacity the animals that
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '5319.92'
    text: get the chocolate
  - dur: '8.28'
    start: '5321.76'
    text: reward experience this kind of regrowth
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '5325.96'
    text: pattern where they over enough time they
  - dur: '7.48'
    start: '5330.04'
    text: see these connections getting formed
  - dur: '6.68'
    start: '5332.8'
    text: that sort of bypass the injury site and
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '5337.52'
    text: over time they can put the chocolate in
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '5339.48'
    text: front of the the rat and the rat can
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '5342'
    text: actually initiate the stepping behavior
  - dur: '2.68'
    start: '5344.4'
    text: before the robotic Gantry kind of pulls
  - dur: '2.761'
    start: '5346.159'
    text: them
  - dur: '6.8'
    start: '5347.08'
    text: forward
  - dur: '7.96'
    start: '5348.92'
    text: and that is I think really amazing and
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '5353.88'
    text: the idea is that it Taps into the kind
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '5356.88'
    text: of the way that we that we move our
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '5358.92'
    text: bodies in the world it wasn&amp;#39;t enough for
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '5361.52'
    text: the for the for the control rats to keep
  - dur: '2.88'
    start: '5365.04'
    text: doing the stepping Behavior because it
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '5366.44'
    text: wasn&amp;#39;t connected to anything in the
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '5367.92'
    text: world around it whereas the ones with
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '5369.92'
    text: the chocolate condition um they had the
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '5373'
    text: experience of oh there&amp;#39;s a state there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '5375.32'
    text: something out there in the world that I
  - dur: '5'
    start: '5376.52'
    text: want it&amp;#39;s in front of me I need to walk
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '5379.28'
    text: to get it they start walking they don&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '5381.52'
    text: know that they&amp;#39;re being dragged by a
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '5382.6'
    text: robot and then as a result of that
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '5385'
    text: behavior they get to eat the chocolate
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '5387.28'
    text: and so when that happens it triggers
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '5390.44'
    text: this other concept of the dopamin neric
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '5392.44'
    text: reward system where basically basically
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '5394.4'
    text: the the brain gets flooded with this
  - dur: '4.759'
    start: '5395.96'
    text: reward chemical that called dopamine and
  - dur: '7.16'
    start: '5398.6'
    text: a bunch of other stuff that basically
  - dur: '7.241'
    start: '5400.719'
    text: has the the the effect of reinforcing
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '5405.76'
    text: all the neurons that were just firing
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '5407.96'
    text: just dup energic award system is kind of
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '5410'
    text: how that works and so it&amp;#39;s that
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '5412.52'
    text: connection between that sort of that
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '5414.28'
    text: frontal area that volitional sort of
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '5416.28'
    text: prefrontal lobe cortex thing of I wish I
  - dur: '3.241'
    start: '5419.159'
    text: was over there so I could eat the
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '5420.44'
    text: chocolate and then a bunch of neural fa
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '5422.4'
    text: activity happens then you get to eat the
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '5424'
    text: chocolate and then your brain gets
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '5425.56'
    text: flooded with neurons that say whatever
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '5427.48'
    text: was just happening reinforce that and
  - dur: '9.28'
    start: '5430'
    text: then that is enough to trigger regrowth
  - dur: '7.56'
    start: '5433.76'
    text: of neurons at the spinal level and that
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '5439.28'
    text: is as much as I&amp;#39;m going to say about
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '5441.32'
    text: this paper and uh end of class so thanks
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '5445.48'
    text: for following along and uh I&amp;#39;ll see you
  - dur: '2.279'
    start: '5448.36'
    text: all on
  - dur: '7.839'
    start: '5451.84'
    text: Wednesday going to do two papers

      and science, emphasizing the importance of empirical measurement and skepticism
      in scientific inquiry. It introduces Cartesian and polar coordinates for spatial
      measurement, discusses the use of SI units, and explains basic physics concepts
      like force and energy conservation. The lecture also explores the center of
      mass and its application in biomechanics, using anthropometric data to simplify
      complex systems. The speaker encourages students to focus on understanding concepts
      rather than memorizing details, with a preview of future topics like pendulums.\n\n---\n\n**Page

    start: '49.719'
    text: for each stage um but they&amp;#39;re all
  - dur: '3.12'

    text: so so today&amp;#39;s lecture is going to be
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '148.72'
    text: about like measurement units and things
  - dur: '5'
    start: '150.84'
    text: like that sort of like hopefully more
  - dur: '6.681'
    start: '152.879'

  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '155.84'
    text: and whatnot um and I want to do it now
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '159.56'

    start: '169.2'
    text: recording uh which will be our
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '171.8'
    text: first relationship with like sort of
  - dur: '3.721'
    start: '176.319'
    text: more classical data like I I keep
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '178.04'
    text: referring to like this the text stuff
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '180.04'
    text: that you&amp;#39;re punching into the server as
  - dur: '4.96'

    text: yeah I guess technically but it&amp;#39;s only
  - dur: '5.681'

  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '206.599'
    text: demos and things like that so we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.959'

    start: '241'
    text: there is the same sort of at the bottom
  - dur: '6.92'
    start: '244.36'
    text: 127 so that&amp;#39;s the server scraped and
  - dur: '7.24'
    start: '246.48'
    text: analyzed as of this morning um so same
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '251.28'
    text: thing download it unzip it if you don&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '2.6'
    start: '253.72'
    text: know what unzipping is it&amp;#39;s the thing
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '255'
    text: where you double click in and it makes a
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '256.32'
    text: folder next door um that you can open
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '258.72'
    text: like a regular thing um so you can
  - dur: '3.721'
    start: '261.359'
    text: search for your name in there I&amp;#39;m going
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '262.56'
    text: to be refactoring the way that we do the
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '265.08'
    text: student profile building thing so like
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '267.199'
    text: your individual profiles are going to
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '269.24'
    text: change probably next week um just
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '270.919'
    text: because I&amp;#39;m going to change theof the
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '273'
    text: code and prompts that make it um I
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '276'
    text: realized that it would probably give you
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '278.16'
    text: a much more precise measurement of who
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '280.96'
    text: what you&amp;#39;re interested in if I didn&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '282.84'
    text: use everything you put in the server for
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '284.84'
    text: the profile but just use the assignment
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '286.759'
    text: chats so the ones from your intro and
  - dur: '6.599'
    start: '288.44'
    text: the poster presentation thing um and I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '292.4'
    text: also you know in the process I might
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '295.039'
    text: also set something up that you can sort
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '297'
    text: of in a given chat you can like ask the
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '299.4'
    text: bot to remember you and it will pull
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '301.199'
    text: that history into the conversation and
  - dur: '2.56'
    start: '304.8'
    text: that will sort of you don&amp;#39;t have to
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '306'
    text: start every conversation from scratch
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '307.36'

  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '332.84'
    text: don&amp;#39;t know why two things pop up um this
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '335.8'
    text: is the course repository this is the
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '338.039'
    text: sort of the most up to-date oh
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '342.8'

    text: is not the code the text is uh which is
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '377.28'
    text: you know code that code for primates um
  - dur: '2.881'
    start: '381.479'
    text: and that&amp;#39;s updated this is called a this
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '383.08'
    text: is GitHub that&amp;#39;s kind of what GitHub
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '384.36'
    text: does it&amp;#39;s a Version Control software
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '386.56'
    text: it&amp;#39;s kind of like track changes but um
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '390.8'
    text: more sophisticated um pretty much every
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '393.52'
    text: piece of software you&amp;#39;ve ever used in
  - dur: '7.32'
    start: '394.96'
    text: your life has used git at some level um
  - dur: '6.919'
    start: '399.4'
    text: and I&amp;#39;m kind of like hijacking it to do
  - dur: '4.039'
    start: '402.28'
    text: text based stuff
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '407.88'
    text: um so yeah and also just to be clear
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '412.12'

    text: there uh this is what it looks like
  - dur: '6.959'
    start: '428.08'
    text: formatted that&amp;#39;s what it looks like raw
  - dur: '8.479'
    start: '431.12'
    text: this is a honest measurement and record
  - dur: '7'
    start: '435.039'
    text: of exactly what my primate body did to a
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '439.599'
    text: keyboard at some point in time so it is
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '442.039'
    text: a truth preserving record of my thoughts
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '444.44'
    text: in a way that a docx file or a Google
  - dur: '6.88'
    start: '447.12'
    text: Drive Link sort of will never be so
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '449.84'
    text: shout out to markdown in raw text
  - dur: '4.479'
    start: '454.28'
    text: formats
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '456'
    text: okay right so on this

    start: '476.68'
    text: 25127 intro to measurement and the top
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '479.72'
    text: one is called intro to measurement and
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '481.599'
    text: here we go it&amp;#39;s the what&amp;#39;s it called the
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '485.12'
    text: notes for my notes for the lecture that
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '488.319'
    text: we&amp;#39;re about to give and with that I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '6.801'
    start: '489.919'
    text: going to switch away from the GitHub and
  - dur: '6.679'
    start: '492.24'
    text: go to my local version just because I
  - dur: '2.199'
    start: '496.72'
    text: want
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '499.199'
    text: to
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '500.84'
    text: uh local meaning on this
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '504.159'
    text: machine not on the internet some other
  - dur: '4.239'
    start: '507.8'
    text: servers machine GitHub is own by
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '509.84'
    text: Microsoft so technically that state data
  - dur: '7.641'
    start: '512.039'
    text: is hosted on Microsoft um this is on my
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '515.56'
    text: computer okay
  - dur: '4.479'
    start: '525.04'
    text: cool this is a brief summary we&amp;#39;ll see
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '528.279'
    text: how much we get through I think we&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '7'
    start: '529.519'
    text: get through all of it
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '532.6'
    text: so here we are in this class extensively
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '536.519'
    text: to teach y&amp;#39;all what science is what
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '538.68'
    text: science looks like how you might ever do
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '542.16'
    text: such a wacky thing as to attempt to know
  - dur: '6'
    start: '544.88'
    text: the world and do Empirical research
  - dur: '7.08'
    start: '547.24'
    text: within it um and there&amp;#39;s a lot of things
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '550.88'
    text: that get taken for granted by when you
  - dur: '7.28'
    start: '554.32'
    text: sort of just live as a human person in a
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '557.36'
    text: world um that you start to find yourself
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '561.6'
    text: needing to get much more specific about
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '563.48'
    text: once you actually start to trying start
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '565.519'
    text: trying to get into the business of
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '567.399'
    text: knowledge generation so the idea as a
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '570.44'
    text: scientist is that you are attempting to
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '572.2'
    text: create new knowledge for humankind um
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '575.76'
    text: which is a very difficult thing to do
  - dur: '8.12'
    start: '577.36'
    text: it&amp;#39;s hard to know stuff um and there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '581.6'
    text: certain rules for how to do that um
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '585.48'
    text: so a lot of what we talk about in The
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '588.16'
    text: Sciences the empirical Sciences is based
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '590.36'
    text: on the concept of empirical measurement
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '592.32'
    text: so um there are many ways to know things
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '595.92'
    text: um the scientific method and empirical
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '598.12'
    text: method is one way to know the world it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '601.56'
    text: a very powerful way to know the world
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '603.32'
    text: because it allows you to do things like
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '605.48'
    text: make predictions about the future build
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '607.279'
    text: tools uh heal people when they&amp;#39;re sick
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '609.88'
    text: things like that
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '612.04'
    text: um and everything is sort of in that
  - dur: '6.081'
    start: '615.519'
    text: sort of conception of knowledge is is
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '618.88'
    text: based on at some level an empirical
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '621.6'
    text: measurement uh of the world
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '625.2'
    text: where yeah empirical measurement is
  - dur: '2.08'
    start: '627.68'
    text: we&amp;#39;re going to talk a little about what
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '628.68'
    text: that means but BAS basically it&amp;#39;s the
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '629.76'
    text: idea that you have done yeah you&amp;#39;ve done
  - dur: '4'
    start: '631.92'
    text: some kind of a measurement and that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.079'
    start: '634.32'
    text: what that term measurement is one of
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '635.92'
    text: those kind of
  - dur: '3.361'
    start: '637.399'
    text: like one of those terms that gets taken
  - dur: '2.32'
    start: '639.48'
    text: for granted but we&amp;#39;ll talk a little bit
  - dur: '3.519'
    start: '640.76'
    text: about what that
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '641.8'
    text: means um so the most important thing to
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '644.279'
    text: sort of I don&amp;#39;t about the most but one
  - dur: '2.76'
    start: '646'
    text: of the most one of the very important
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '647.639'
    text: things to think about when you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '648.76'
    text: thinking about Empirical research and
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '651.32'
    text: the concept of measurement is that
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '654.56'
    text: everything that you&amp;#39;re doing everything
  - dur: '5.519'
    start: '656.76'
    text: that you&amp;#39;re building on has to be built
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '659.6'
    text: relative to something else so when
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '662.279'
    text: you&amp;#39;re trying to if you&amp;#39;re trying like
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '665.04'
    text: if you&amp;#39;re uh trying to generate new
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '668.399'
    text: knowledge that knowledge that is going
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '670.639'
    text: to be sort of based on other things like
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '673.2'
    text: I used the term earlier of Truth
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '674.6'
    text: preserving a very important term in sort
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '677.88'
    text: of philosophy of science um because that
  - dur: '4.759'
    start: '680.2'
    text: is the concept of being able to build
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '682.48'
    text: from one thing that you know another
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '684.959'
    text: thing that you might know and everything
  - dur: '3.279'
    start: '686.8'
    text: that you think you know about the world
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '688.56'
    text: if you sort of dig into it is going to
  - dur: '3.721'
    start: '690.079'
    text: be based off some sort of background of

    start: '693.8'
    text: because I learn that because I believe
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '695.32'
    text: this because of all that kind of stuff
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '697.48'
    text: um so it&amp;#39;s helpful when you&amp;#39;re sort of
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '699.279'
    text: trying to learn the concepts of
  - dur: '5.44'

    text: measurement to try to
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '703.839'
    text: recreate those epistemological chains
  - dur: '6.041'

    text: where epistemology is the study of
  - dur: '7.801'
    start: '709.079'
    text: knowledge um and try to ask yourself
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '712.88'
    text: sort of where these things connect to um
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '716.88'
    text: if I were to redo this which I will some
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '719.48'
    text: time I probably would have put this one
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '722.6'
    text: up top so where the most important thing
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '725.079'
    text: is that skepticism is the basis of
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '727.399'

    start: '735'
    text: have to have reasons to believe the

    text: things that you believe um you&amp;#39;re not

    start: '738.68'
    text: allowed to just believe things for no
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '740.16'
    text: reason um and everything that you sort
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '742.68'
    text: of that you consider has to be kind of
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '745.44'
    text: you know you have to look directly at it
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '747.279'
    text: and try to boil down sort of what that
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '749'
    text: is connected
  - dur: '9.68'
    start: '750.519'
    text: to um so given that it is reasonable to

    text: ask about Origins um and the sort of
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '760.199'
    text: philosophical the the classical

    text: tend to ascribe to this dude de cart who
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '768.44'

    text: heard of his cartisian coordinates and
  - dur: '5.56'

  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '774.519'
    text: about in various points in time um but
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '778.6'
    text: he has quot is sort of trying to do this
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '781.079'
    text: philosophical game of trying to

    start: '782.959'
    text: understand what his knowledge of the
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '785.279'

    start: '787.88'
    text: this wonderful little phrase called

    start: '794.44'
    text: fancy way of saying that if you really

    text: drill down to it the only thing that you
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '798.88'
    text: can actually truly know and believe
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '801.88'
    text: without reference to some other sort of
  - dur: '5.481'
    start: '804.959'

  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '825.16'
    text: you did yesterday that could be fake you

    text: could have done Heist hallucinogenics
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '829.519'
    text: you could have had some someone could be

    start: '831.36'
    text: poking at your brain that could all be
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '833.44'
    text: fake your perception of the world around
  - dur: '3.721'
    start: '835.519'

    start: '852.16'
    text: skepticism you you could deny you could
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '854.639'
    text: doubt um that the the veracity of

    start: '857.24'
    text: anything else besides that Central

    text: of nihilistic belief you were left with
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '868.72'
    text: a rather un uninteresting philosophical
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '871.519'
    text: position called solipsism which is the
  - dur: '3.481'
    start: '873.759'
    text: belief that you are the only person that
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '875.6'
    text: exists and everything else around you
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '877.24'
    text: was fake and all other people you see
  - dur: '7.16'
    start: '879.16'
    text: are just Illusions um that is
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '882.519'
    text: technically I believe the only truly
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '886.32'
    text: defensible philosophical position it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '888.399'
    text: also not useful or helpful or
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '890.759'
    text: particularly
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '892'
    text: interesting um because we we ALS because
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '895.6'
    text: if you&amp;#39;re willing to accept other
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '897.92'
    text: gradients of belief and gradients of
  - dur: '5.481'
    start: '899.759'
    text: Truth into your life you can start to
  - dur: '5.479'
    start: '902.48'
    text: build what feels like knowledge about
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '905.24'
    text: the real world um as long as you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.361'
    start: '907.959'
    text: willing to have things like you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '909.44'
    text: you&amp;#39;re willing to have things like trust
  - dur: '3.519'
    start: '911.32'
    text: in things like memory and if you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '913.48'
    text: willing to sort of smush together all
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '914.839'
    text: your memory and then believe such thing
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '916.44'
    text: as statistics you can actually do quite
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '918.759'
    text: a lot with that because yes I can doubt
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '921.759'
    text: I like I can doubt that there&amp;#39;s a cup in
  - dur: '3.719'
    start: '923.56'
    text: front of me right now but if I keep
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '925.72'
    text: looking and it keeps happening and I
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '927.279'
    text: keep moving and it has the sort of like
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '929'
    text: geometrically reasonable deformations
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '931.24'
    text: and then I reach out and then I have a
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '932.92'
    text: cup in my hand and then I put it to my
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '934.72'
    text: mouth and I get liquid at a certain
  - dur: '4.519'
    start: '936.56'
    text: point the accumulation of those sensory
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '938.36'
    text: experiences starts to really resemble
  - dur: '3.281'
    start: '941.079'
    text: something like knowledge that I might
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '942.759'
    text: have about the real world like it might
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '944.36'
    text: it it starts to become increasingly
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '947.04'
    text: likely that there is in fact something
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '949.079'
    text: resembling a cup in what in somewhere
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '951.92'
    text: outside of my conscious experience
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '955.519'
    text: um and which is great because that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '958.12'
    text: what allows us to sort of we we match
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '960.959'
    text: each other in this universe on the basis
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '963.24'
    text: of our shared memories and statistics
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '966.319'
    text: and luckily that doesn&amp;#39;t really it&amp;#39;s not
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '969.36'
    text: really that hard to do but it
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '972.079'
    text: is sort of troubling to think too
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '974.319'
    text: closely
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '976.319'
    text: about so from the epistemological point
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '979.48'
    text: of view we&amp;#39;re going to base our
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '980.88'
    text: knowledge on sort of the awareness that
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '984.16'
    text: we exist which is good and then I really
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '987.12'
    text: hate to say it but the only but on the
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '989.36'
    text: other the other thing we have is memory
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '990.72'
    text: and statistics not a lot but we can work
  - dur: '2.72'
    start: '993.16'
    text: from
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '994.16'
    text: there
  - dur: '3'
    start: '995.88'
    text: um
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '999.519'
    text: now with that I&amp;#39;m going to shift away
  - dur: '4.039'
    start: '1003.6'
    text: from
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '1005.16'
    text: uh that sort of philosophical
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1007.639'
    text: epistemological kind of like floofy
  - dur: '6.601'
    start: '1009.839'
    text: exist Central crisis philosophy 101 type
  - dur: '7.281'
    start: '1012.399'
    text: of space and shift back into the more
  - dur: '6'
    start: '1016.44'
    text: like rigidly sort of imp Al grounded
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '1019.68'
    text: world of direct empirical measurements
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '1022.44'
    text: but we&amp;#39;re going to have a similar game
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '1024.72'
    text: to be played there where when we think
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1027.16'
    text: about something like
  - dur: '3'
    start: '1028.4'
    text: measurement
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1031.959'
    text: um we still have to base that
  - dur: '7'
    start: '1034.079'
    text: measurement on something so let&amp;#39;s talk
  - dur: '7.921'
    start: '1036.959'
    text: about let&amp;#39;s talk about measuring things
  - dur: '6.521'
    start: '1041.079'
    text: and let&amp;#39;s start I think simply simply
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1044.88'
    text: enough with a really basic measurement
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '1047.6'
    text: called distance
  - dur: '7.88'
    start: '1049.52'
    text: spatial distance um this lecture has a
  - dur: '7.24'
    start: '1052.12'
    text: lot of uh props and visual aids all made
  - dur: '7.56'
    start: '1057.4'
    text: roughly speaking out of garbage that I
  - dur: '9.4'
    start: '1059.36'
    text: found outside um this is a stick that is
  - dur: '7.8'
    start: '1064.96'
    text: kind enough to be roughly a meter long
  - dur: '6.399'
    start: '1068.76'
    text: um and also can be screwed apart it was
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1072.76'
    text: actually this like the stem of a lamp
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '1075.159'
    text: that I found and I didn&amp;#39;t wind up liking
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1077.76'
    text: the lamp but then I realized that if I
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '1080.36'
    text: pulled it apart then I could stop having
  - dur: '9.8'
    start: '1082.64'
    text: to pull a meter long broom stick onto
  - dur: '8.44'
    start: '1087'
    text: campus once oh once a
  - dur: '3'
    start: '1092.44'
    text: semester
  - dur: '6.519'
    start: '1096.52'
    text: so so
  - dur: '7.24'
    start: '1098.96'
    text: yeah you need to find one that I can see
  - dur: '6.361'
    start: '1103.039'
    text: hiking stick could probably do well here
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '1106.2'
    text: okay so this is
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '1109.4'
    text: this is a stick this has let&amp;#39;s say such
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '1112.44'
    text: a thing as measurement as a as a length
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '1115.88'
    text: so if you wanted to measure things in
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '1118.48'
    text: the world you could use something like
  - dur: '2.721'
    start: '1120.919'
    text: this let&amp;#39;s pretend that this is one
  - dur: '2.68'
    start: '1122.32'
    text: meter long even though it&amp;#39;s actually
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '1123.64'
    text: slightly longer than that let&amp;#39;s pretend
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '1125'
    text: like it&amp;#39;s a meter and we wanted to
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '1127.36'
    text: measure something
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '1128.799'
    text: so let&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '7.399'
    start: '1132.28'
    text: see thisle brought colors today so we&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '6.801'
    start: '1134.919'
    text: see how that goes for us uh RGB R green
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '1139.679'
    text: we start with black I
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '1141.72'
    text: guess so if we&amp;#39;re trying to measure the
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '1144.159'
    text: length of things let&amp;#39;s say we&amp;#39;re trying
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '1145.4'
    text: to measure the length of the room or how
  - dur: '6'
    start: '1147.679'
    text: tall you are how tall this thing is
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '1150.24'
    text: whatever um we&amp;#39;re going to want to
  - dur: '3.441'
    start: '1153.679'
    text: eventually re repres you know write
  - dur: '3.399'
    start: '1155.76'
    text: these num so we&amp;#39;re going to have some
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1157.12'
    text: sort of a measurement tool like this or
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '1159.159'
    text: a you know what&amp;#39;s it called tape measure
  - dur: '2.64'
    start: '1161.12'
    text: something like that and we&amp;#39;re going to
  - dur: '2.88'
    start: '1162.799'
    text: make some measurements and then we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1163.76'
    text: going to write them down um but when we
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '1165.679'

  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '1167.76'
    text: writing down a number of some kind uh so
  - dur: '2.76'
    start: '1171.6'
    text: and let&amp;#39;s sort of skip a couple steps to
  - dur: '2.16'
    start: '1173.32'
    text: then get to the place where we&amp;#39;ve
  - dur: '3.319'
    start: '1174.36'
    text: written down a bunch of numbers now we
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '1175.48'
    text: want to represent them sort of to
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '1177.679'
    text: communicate we&amp;#39;ve done a scientific
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '1179.6'
    text: study on how long various things are and
  - dur: '5.719'
    start: '1182.08'
    text: we want to present this research to our
  - dur: '6.479'
    start: '1184.32'
    text: conspecifics and colleagues so you have
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '1187.799'
    text: to write them down so we have various
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '1190.799'
    text: ways of
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '1192.2'
    text: measuring things like space and time um
  - dur: '2.68'
    start: '1195.76'
    text: and we&amp;#39;re going to start with space and
  - dur: '3.399'
    start: '1197.28'
    text: then we&amp;#39;re going to eventually get to
  - dur: '7'
    start: '1198.44'
    text: time which won&amp;#39;t take which is actually
  - dur: '7.161'
    start: '1200.679'
    text: not worry about it um
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '1205.44'
    text: so the first thing you might want to in
  - dur: '2.88'
    start: '1207.84'
    text: measuring things you have things like
  - dur: '2.639'
    start: '1209.28'
    text: Dimensions you have one dimensional two
  - dur: '2.439'
    start: '1210.72'
    text: dimensional three dimensional High
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '1211.919'
    text: dimensional we&amp;#39;ll talk about these
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '1213.159'
    text: things in a second um and in all these
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '1216.2'
    text: cases it&amp;#39;s going to start with something
  - dur: '7.76'
    start: '1217.84'
    text: resembling An Origin so this is the
  - dur: '7.76'
    start: '1221.799'
    text: origin it is the it is a zero
  - dur: '6.959'
    start: '1225.6'
    text: dimensional object um it contains no
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1229.559'
    text: real information other than it exists
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '1232.559'
    text: right this is an or this is a point that
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '1234.559'
    text: doesn&amp;#39;t exist this is a point that does
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '1236.76'
    text: exists so this point conveys the
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1239.12'
    text: information hello yes I exist and not
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '1241.799'
    text: really that much else not particularly
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '1244.24'
    text: useful scientifically but very important
  - dur: '3.439'
    start: '1247.72'
    text: when you&amp;#39;re trying to figure out if I
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '1249.039'
    text: come to you and I say oh hey that thing
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '1251.159'
    text: is three and a half sticks
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '1253.559'
    text: long that is implicitly relative to
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '1256.4'
    text: something which is zero sticks long
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '1258'
    text: which is something that doesn&amp;#39;t which
  - dur: '6.561'
    start: '1259.559'
    text: has no extent
  - dur: '7.76'
    start: '1261.96'
    text: so Zero Dimensional gr great good job so
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '1266.12'
    text: now let&amp;#39;s think about this Dimension and
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '1269.72'
    text: let&amp;#39;s call it X because that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '1271.32'
    text: traditionally how we do it and this is
  - dur: '6'
    start: '1273.88'
    text: now a one dimensional object so let&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '7.799'
    start: '1275.88'
    text: say this is infinitely long and we&amp;#39;ve
  - dur: '8.039'
    start: '1279.88'
    text: measured this is one stick long so this
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '1283.679'
    text: stick is there so there you go so one
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '1287.919'
    text: one one stick long and then I can
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '1289.84'
    text: measure two sticks three sticks
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1300.2'
    text: Etc that&amp;#39;s way
  - dur: '7'
    start: '1302.919'
    text: better so now if I&amp;#39;m going around
  - dur: '7.56'
    start: '1305.2'
    text: measuring things I can keep track of the
  - dur: '5.521'
    start: '1309.919'
    text: length of the thing but again this is
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '1312.76'
    text: not particularly exciting this is
  - dur: '2.52'
    start: '1315.44'
    text: there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s not really a point of
  - dur: '3.319'
    start: '1316.6'
    text: drawing that you just write down the
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '1317.96'
    text: number you don&amp;#39;t gain anything by
  - dur: '3.441'
    start: '1319.919'
    text: looking at that number relative to zero
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '1322'
    text: other than just the knowledge of how
  - dur: '2.319'
    start: '1323.36'
    text: numbers
  - dur: '6.239'
    start: '1327.44'
    text: work so so that&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re going to call
  - dur: '7.079'
    start: '1330.96'
    text: that X we&amp;#39;re also going to call
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '1333.679'
    text: that length great so now we want to
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '1338.039'
    text: measure such so and that&amp;#39;s good for
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '1339.559'
    text: measuring things like string or
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '1342.159'
    text: distances from here to your house or
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '1345.72'
    text: height of a person but now we want to go
  - dur: '3.441'
    start: '1347.919'
    text: around we want to measure different
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '1349.12'
    text: things we&amp;#39;re still doing stuff in we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '1351.36'
    text: still measuring length and distances and
  - dur: '5.761'
    start: '1353.559'
    text: now we&amp;#39;re going to split and have a
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '1356.2'
    text: second dimension that we&amp;#39;ll call Y we&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '1359.32'
    text: also call that height and it uses the
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '1362.48'
    text: same unit so you can still be one stick
  - dur: '5.441'
    start: '1364.159'
    text: tall you can be two sticks
  - dur: '7.681'
    start: '1367.159'
    text: tall things like that and so now you can
  - dur: '8.319'
    start: '1369.6'
    text: measure things like boards and desks and
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '1374.84'
    text: floors and if you measure something in
  - dur: '5.801'
    start: '1377.919'
    text: it&amp;#39;s two units long and then one unit
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '1381.08'
    text: tall then that&amp;#39;s a point in that space
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '1383.72'
    text: and that is a two-dimensional Point
  - dur: '3.519'
    start: '1386.52'
    text: two-dimensional meaning it&amp;#39;s got two
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '1387.919'
    text: numbers you have to use to define it in
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '1390.039'
    text: the robotics world someday like we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '1393.159'
    text: going
  - dur: '6.321'
    start: '1393.919'
    text: to I know this is basic we will be
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '1397.6'
    text: ramping up from here um but another way
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '1400.24'
    text: to think about this is it&amp;#39;s two degrees
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '1401.96'
    text: of freedom meaning that if you want to
  - dur: '5.519'
    start: '1404.52'
    text: know the area of something uh you need
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '1408.2'
    text: to know two numbers to be able to Define
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '1410.039'
    text: that entirely you need length you need
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '1412.919'
    text: width and you could do that in various
  - dur: '6.599'
    start: '1414.44'
    text: other ways but this is a two dimensional
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1417.72'
    text: number um so now you want to measure
  - dur: '3.321'
    start: '1421.039'
    text: thing you want to keep going so you want
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '1422.36'
    text: to keep measuring something in a higher
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1424.36'
    text: dimensional space so you&amp;#39;ve got length
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1426.84'
    text: you&amp;#39;ve got area area is length times
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '1429.48'
    text: width or something like that and so now
  - dur: '7'
    start: '1431.24'
    text: you want to also measure volume and with
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '1436.24'
    text: that I have run out of dimensions on the
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '1438.24'
    text: board I can no longer so this is an
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '1441.279'
    text: 'accurate one: one representation of the'
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1443.2'
    text: two-dimensional Point XY if I want to
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '1446.08'
    text: make a three-dimensional space I no
  - dur: '2.479'
    start: '1448.08'
    text: longer have enough dimensions on this
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '1449.52'
    text: board because this board is a
  - dur: '4.521'
    start: '1450.559'
    text: two-dimensional object so we can fake it
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '1453.2'
    text: and do this kind of like right angle
  - dur: '7.16'
    start: '1455.08'
    text: thing let&amp;#39;s call this guy back here
  - dur: '6.681'
    start: '1458.559'
    text: Z and think
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '1462.24'
    text: about how do we do this so we
  - dur: '8.6'
    start: '1465.24'
    text: go so one two
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1469.2'
    text: and then one two three
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '1474.559'
    text: so so this is
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '1479.919'
    text: XZ and then we can also pain that
  - dur: '7.48'
    start: '1484.799'
    text: up that&amp;#39;s a little screwy but it&amp;#39;s fine
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '1487'
    text: you get it x y z great this is a three
  - dur: '4.481'
    start: '1492.279'
    text: dimensional
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '1493.32'
    text: Point we&amp;#39;ve done it that&amp;#39;s great um so
  - dur: '2.799'
    start: '1496.76'
    text: this is how you can measure if you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1497.919'
    text: trying to categorize objects according
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '1499.559'
    text: to their volume you need three degrees
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '1501.919'
    text: of freedom you need three numbers to
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '1503.52'
    text: Define that volume specifically and you
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1506.2'
    text: can represent that spatially in this
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '1508.159'
    text: nice sort of three-dimensional grid
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '1511.32'
    text: here um now I don&amp;#39;t want to belabor this
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '1514'
    text: point too much because it will we&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '1516.36'
    text: sort of get there but
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '1519.76'
    text: so this is three
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '1521.88'
    text: dimensions traditionally if you ever if
  - dur: '3.561'
    start: '1525.039'
    text: you&amp;#39;re going to touch engineering this
  - dur: '6.319'
    start: '1527.08'
    text: is the international symbol for
  - dur: '8.16'
    start: '1528.6'
    text: threedimensional space x x y z this is
  - dur: '6.081'
    start: '1533.399'
    text: the right hand rule um so doing it
  - dur: '9.88'
    start: '1536.76'
    text: backwards here but it would be was that
  - dur: '9.079'
    start: '1539.48'
    text: yeah it&amp;#39;s like this so XY Z XY z um this
  - dur: '6.279'
    start: '1546.64'
    text: is a left-handed coordinate system it is
  - dur: '5.961'
    start: '1548.559'
    text: illegal don&amp;#39;t do this just because of
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1552.919'
    text: the rules
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '1554.52'
    text: um actually there&amp;#39;s more to be said
  - dur: '5.801'
    start: '1556.919'
    text: there but we can SK past it
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '1559.559'
    text: um and so in three dimensions is how
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '1562.72'
    text: many we have in this in in space in
  - dur: '6.041'
    start: '1566.039'
    text: three dimensional space in humans we are
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '1568.88'
    text: super good at a lot of spatial estimates
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '1572.08'
    text: and we really are very good at making
  - dur: '6.959'
    start: '1573.84'
    text: things making um very quick calculations
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '1577.52'
    text: of things like the cup is is is in front
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1580.799'
    text: of the bottle the cup is near the edge
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '1582.44'
    text: of the table those kind of spatial um
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '1585.799'
    text: what&amp;#39;s the word computations are very
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '1588.799'
    text: easy for us now there&amp;#39;s nothing special
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1592.279'
    text: about three dimensions except for that
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1594.279'
    text: that&amp;#39;s how many you need to define space
  - dur: '3.761'
    start: '1596.679'
    text: and time but you can keep going with
  - dur: '3.201'
    start: '1598.919'
    text: these numbers if you&amp;#39;re trying to define
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '1600.44'
    text: something that requires more than three
  - dur: '5.439'
    start: '1602.12'
    text: numbers to Define um and again I don&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '1605.84'
    text: want to blab this point too much but I I
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '1607.559'
    text: will say that it has to do with
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '1609.48'
    text: Pythagorean theorem and like how you
  - dur: '6.681'
    start: '1611.279'
    text: measure things like distance um because
  - dur: '8.68'
    start: '1613.64'
    text: in one dimension the distance from a
  - dur: '9.199'
    start: '1617.96'
    text: point to the to the origin is trivially
  - dur: '13.56'
    start: '1622.32'
    text: sort of two so pyan is the one
  - dur: '12.961'
    start: '1627.159'
    text: that&amp;#39;s a b c so a 2 + b^2 = C2 so c
  - dur: '7'
    start: '1635.88'
    text: equal &amp;lt; TK of a + b a s plus bqu
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '1640.12'
    text: whatever so this is how you do distance
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '1642.88'
    text: you&amp;#39;ve all seen this I&amp;#39;m sure at various
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '1644.919'
    text: points in your high school career um
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '1647.84'
    text: this is the the particular case of doing
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '1649.84'
    text: Pythagorean theorem for two Dimensions
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '1652.039'
    text: you replace the A and B with X and Y and
  - dur: '3.199'
    start: '1656.36'
    text: then you have a way to measure distance
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '1657.72'
    text: in a two- dimensional space in a
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '1659.559'
    text: one-dimensional space it&amp;#39;s very you know
  - dur: '5.76'

    text: that works is it is it uses that same
  - dur: '3.199'

    text: like oh my God it&amp;#39;s so crazy it just
  - dur: '2.921'

  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '1722.88'
    text: much the same um I will say too there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1726.12'
    text: a lot of we&amp;#39;re going to do like General
  - dur: '5'

    text: like mathy stuff here um but luckily you
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '1731'
    text: don&amp;#39;t have to do any of the math you
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '1732.679'
    text: just have to understand it which is so
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '1734.72'
    text: much easier like because I know that
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '1736.88'
    text: there&amp;#39;s a part where I&amp;#39;m sort of I say
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '1739.159'
    text: oh look you can have two x y things like
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '1741.039'
    text: that and that like makes some intuitive
  - dur: '5.719'
    start: '1743.2'
    text: sense um and I just need to promise you
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '1746.88'
    text: that that intuitive gut check of like
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1748.919'
    text: yeah that makes rough sense that&amp;#39;s the
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1751.279'
    text: vast vast vast majority of the things
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1753.559'
    text: that you actually need to know about
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '1756.039'
    text: mathematics like being able to do it on
  - dur: '5.281'

    text: paper helps um the guy who touchs the
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '1761.96'
    text: class before this I&amp;#39;m sure would have
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '1763.96'
    text: many things to say about what I&amp;#39;m about
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '1765.2'
    text: to say but I firmly believe that
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '1768.799'
    text: being able to do the math on paper is
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '1770.88'
    text: just it&amp;#39;s an extra layer of
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '1772.72'
    text: understanding on top of the gut check
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '1774.76'
    text: intuitions that will get you most of the
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '1776.799'
    text: way towards where you need to
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '1778.84'
    text: go
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1781.64'
    text: um okay yeah so right now we&amp;#39;re talking
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '1784.32'
    text: about let&amp;#39;s make this simpler and just
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '1786.64'
    text: go back down to two Dimensions because
  - dur: '2.2'
    start: '1789'
    text: it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '8.039'
    start: '1794'
    text: easier there we go 2D
  - dur: '5.919'
    start: '1798.88'
    text: great um so this is we call these
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1802.039'
    text: cartisian coordinates because ofart
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '1804.799'
    text: because Western science and math likes
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '1806.919'
    text: to name things after the people that
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '1808.6'
    text: discover them which is annoying as hell
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '1810.84'
    text: because the same people discover so many
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '1812.72'
    text: things that you end up replac using all
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '1814.2'
    text: these words all over again it&amp;#39;s really
  - dur: '5.801'
    start: '1816.399'
    text: obnoxious um but these are called
  - dur: '7.2'
    start: '1818.76'
    text: cartisian coordinates ostensibly named
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '1822.2'
    text: for C deart who the story is that he was
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '1825.96'
    text: he was like a sickly guy and he was like
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '1828'
    text: in his bed and was watching a fly
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1830.399'
    text: crawling on a window and realized that
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '1833.08'
    text: he could Define the the fly&amp;#39;s position
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '1835.159'
    text: by just looking at the intersection
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '1837.36'
    text: point between the fly and these two
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '1839.039'
    text: points on the window sill and then thus
  - dur: '3.321'
    start: '1841.799'
    text: made some formalisms and then get to
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '1843.48'
    text: name a whole you get to name the
  - dur: '6.439'
    start: '1845.12'
    text: concepts of a grid after this guy which
  - dur: '5.441'
    start: '1848.159'
    text: is annoying but so this cartisian space
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '1851.559'
    text: is typically defined by things like it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '1853.6'
    text: got straight lines it&amp;#39;s got grids it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '1855.72'
    text: got squares if you go you you know go
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '1858.399'
    text: from two Dimension to three dimension
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '1859.519'
    text: you go from a square to a cube things
  - dur: '4.481'
    start: '1861.639'
    text: like that you could also Define this
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '1863.799'
    text: type of stuff in angular coordinates so
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '1866.12'
    text: I&amp;#39;m if I care about this point in space
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '1869.72'
    text: I could Define it using these sort of
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1872.32'
    text: like straight line you know right right
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '1874.24'
    text: angle projections onto these basis
  - dur: '7.52'
    start: '1876.72'
    text: Vector axes I could also say that it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '7.48'
    start: '1880.6'
    text: you know this far away at that angle off
  - dur: '6.799'
    start: '1884.24'
    text: of zero so I start by I I start from
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '1888.08'
    text: this sort of you know we&amp;#39;ll call they
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '1891.039'
    text: call it X and then we go up by this
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1894.84'
    text: angle which can be degrees or radians or
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '1896.72'
    text: whatever you want then we go out by this
  - dur: '7.439'
    start: '1899.48'
    text: number R by some distance and we still
  - dur: '6.441'
    start: '1902.519'
    text: get to the same spot in 2D space and so
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1906.919'
    text: in and so instead of defining this in
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1908.96'
    text: terms of XY I could also Define it in
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1910.919'
    text: terms of theta row which row is just
  - dur: '3.319'
    start: '1913.96'
    text: like the
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '1914.919'
    text: distance row like radius like if this
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '1917.279'
    text: was a circle it would be whatever that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '1920.399'
    text: not actually what row means but that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '1921.48'
    text: fine and so again noticing that this is
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1924.36'
    text: a two-dimensional point two degrees of
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '1926.72'
    text: freedom and I can Define it either in
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '1928.76'
    text: these linear XY coordinates or I can
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '1930.32'
    text: Define it in these angular Theta row
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1933.84'
    text: coordinates
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '1935.72'
    text: um because yeah you need two numbers to
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '1938.08'
    text: Define its position and so two numbers
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '1939.799'
    text: you get uh once you start if you were to
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '1942.2'
    text: go from so this is a good way to draw
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '1944.639'
    text: circles if you go from 2D to 3D they
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '1946.519'
    text: become spheres and the important thing
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1948.76'
    text: to know is that you can always switch
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '1950.159'
    text: back and forth between the linear
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '1952.76'
    text: coordinate systems or the spherical
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '1954.2'
    text: coordinate systems the sort of we call
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '1956.24'
    text: these polar coordinates versus cartisian
  - dur: '6.239'
    start: '1958.32'
    text: coordinates and in practice when you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '1961.76'
    text: doing stuff you wind up just switching
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '1964.559'
    text: back and forth depending on what you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '1966.36'
    text: doing in the math like you know if I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '1969.399'
    text: looking at things like joint angles it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '1971.32'
    text: really helpful to look at it in terms of
  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '1973.279'
    text: polar coordinates because there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '1974.48'
    text: already got angles in it in fact it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '1976.399'
    text: even easier than that because we looking
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '1979'
    text: at one of these
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '1980.48'
    text: guys this distance we can just assume
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '1982.88'
    text: never changes so now if I&amp;#39;m looking at
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '1984.76'
    text: something like joint angles if I assume
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1987.279'
    text: that these are rigid bodies and and the
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1989.32'
    text: and the r doesn&amp;#39;t change then now I only
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1991.519'
    text: need one number to Define where it is
  - dur: '3.719'
    start: '1994.08'
    text: and not two so now I have like one less
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '1996.399'
    text: number to deal with which is great
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '1997.799'
    text: because we have too many numbers
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '2000.36'
    text: already that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense it might
  - dur: '4'
    start: '2002.96'
    text: tomorrow um
  - dur: '2.28'
    start: '2008.519'
    text: let&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '2018.279'
    text: see I&amp;#39;m going to skip some of this
  - dur: '3.319'
    start: '2020.2'
    text: because it gets too we&amp;#39;re getting pretty
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '2021.679'
    text: mathy pretty quick and this is going to
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '2023.519'
    text: I think make more sense um once there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '2026.08'
    text: data to look at um but the other thing I
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '2028.799'
    text: guess I&amp;#39;ll say just by way of
  - dur: '7.64'
    start: '2030.96'
    text: completeness um we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve been talking
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '2033.919'
    text: about ways of measuring space um and
  - dur: '3.039'
    start: '2038.6'
    text: we also should talk about ways of
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '2040.039'
    text: measuring time you&amp;#39;ll hear you hear
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '2041.639'
    text: terms like spatio temporal coordinates
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '2044.44'
    text: spatio temporal calibration whatnot
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '2047.919'
    text: remember that&amp;#39;s an O term so spatio
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '2049.839'
    text: temporal is just spatial SLT temporal it
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '2052.639'
    text: just means you&amp;#39;re thinking about both
  - dur: '6.159'
    start: '2054.2'
    text: space and time and when you&amp;#39;re looking
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '2058.04'
    text: at data like this it&amp;#39;s very common to
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '2060.359'
    text: see in 2D
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '2062.32'
    text: plots want to keep that I don&amp;#39;t think I
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '2064.48'
    text: need to keep that
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '2069.96'
    text: you see it&amp;#39;s really common to see stuff
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '2071.56'
    text: presented like
  - dur: '6.399'
    start: '2073.44'
    text: this where
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '2075.639'
    text: this this x axis is time and then the y
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '2079.839'
    text: axis is some measurement over time so if
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '2082.679'
    text: we&amp;#39;re thinking that Y is going to be
  - dur: '6'
    start: '2084.399'
    text: let&amp;#39;s say it&amp;#39;s height of my hand off the
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '2087.56'
    text: ground and then at Time Zero we&amp;#39;re going
  - dur: '6.321'
    start: '2090.399'
    text: to measure
  - dur: '6.321'
    start: '2091.879'
    text: it and it&amp;#39;s one so there we go time zero
  - dur: '2.8'
    start: '2096.72'
    text: that&amp;#39;s me at one
  - dur: '2.8'
    start: '2098.2'
    text: and then we&amp;#39;re going to wait let&amp;#39;s say a
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '2099.52'
    text: second and then we&amp;#39;re going to measure
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '2101'
    text: it let&amp;#39;s say it&amp;#39;s now one and a half
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '2103.68'
    text: units off the ground I have time one
  - dur: '5.081'

  - dur: '3.8'

    text: series because it&amp;#39;s a series of
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '2128.56'
    text: measurements over time so this is a
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2130.44'
    text: one-dimensional measurement so I&amp;#39;m just
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '2132.32'
    text: getting height and I&amp;#39;m measuring it once
  - dur: '5.439'

    text: per time unit which could be seconds it
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '2138.48'

  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '2140.359'
    text: it&amp;#39;s going to be 30 frames per second so
  - dur: '5.96'

    text: it&amp;#39;s once every 33 milliseconds you know

    text: if it&amp;#39;s a microphone that records at 44
  - dur: '6.559'

  - dur: '7.321'
    start: '2154.319'
    text: 44,000 seconds um but and that&amp;#39;s how you
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '2158.72'
    text: get measurements over time and the
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '2161.64'
    text: important thing to see is you&amp;#39;ll often
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '2162.68'
    text: see this presented as connect as a
  - dur: '4.24'

  - dur: '3.601'

    text: not actually what you&amp;#39;re measuring um
  - dur: '4.64'

    text: you&amp;#39;re only ever going to be measuring
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '2170.92'
    text: something at time intervals you&amp;#39;re going
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '2174.04'
    text: to be getting one measurement per time
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '2176.44'
    text: interval and so you and so this is what
  - dur: '7.4'
    start: '2179'
    text: your data actually looks like um so if
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '2182.2'
    text: we we have to assume that the movement
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '2186.4'
    text: between the measured interval is kind of
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2188.48'
    text: like cerent like what we expect it to be
  - dur: '3.281'
    start: '2191.599'
    text: and if we do that then we can connect
  - dur: '4'
    start: '2192.96'
    text: the lines and get a nice time series but
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '2194.88'
    text: if this is one measurement every second
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '2196.96'
    text: and I&amp;#39;m doing this with my hand then it
  - dur: '2.72'
    start: '2200.68'
    text: actually doesn&amp;#39;t look like that under
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '2202.319'
    text: the
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '2203.4'
    text: hood if this if these intervals is like
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '2205.92'
    text: one every you know millisecond then we
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '2208.88'
    text: can trust that if it&amp;#39;s one every second
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '2211.24'
    text: I could just as easily be doing this
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '2213.24'
    text: with my hand and we only get these
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '2214.839'
    text: measurements every second so if we
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '2216.8'
    text: interpolate going to be missing a lot of
  - dur: '6.521'
    start: '2218.359'
    text: the story
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '2221.48'
    text: um yeah so that&amp;#39;s time
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '2224.88'
    text: um and I&amp;#39;ll just say it just because
  - dur: '7.16'
    start: '2227.24'
    text: it&amp;#39;s on the thing uh similar to space
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '2231.64'
    text: time can also be thought of in in
  - dur: '5'
    start: '2234.4'
    text: two basic
  - dur: '6.121'
    start: '2236.359'
    text: forms linear time sort of like a
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '2239.4'
    text: stopwatch and phasic time which is like
  - dur: '9.56'
    start: '2242.48'
    text: a clock where it resets to zero
  - dur: '9.4'
    start: '2245.88'
    text: every every Circle through the available
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '2252.04'
    text: values that will become important in the
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '2255.28'
    text: future um blah blah blah if you care
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '2258.4'
    text: about calculus the you know if this is
  - dur: '3.439'
    start: '2260.64'
    text: the position the slope is the velocity
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '2262.599'
    text: because it&amp;#39;s the change in position over
  - dur: '5.881'
    start: '2264.079'
    text: time if you do that again you get
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '2267.72'
    text: acceleration so velocity is the
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '2269.96'
    text: derivative of position acceleration is
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '2271.8'
    text: the derivative of velocity then you go
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '2275.48'
    text: back with the integrals that&amp;#39;s all the
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '2277.48'
    text: calc you ever need to know as far as I
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '2279.28'
    text: care
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '2281.16'
    text: um okay
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '2285.24'
    text: so
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2288'
    text: yeah so that&amp;#39;s measurement right and
  - dur: '2.601'
    start: '2291.319'
    text: we&amp;#39;ve been we&amp;#39;ve been talking about
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '2292.48'
    text: these measurement in terms of kind of
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '2293.92'
    text: these like abstract units so you know
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '2297.319'
    text: singular sticks whatever doesn&amp;#39;t really
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '2300'
    text: it doesn&amp;#39;t matter like in the same sort

  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2303.48'
    text: matter what it is that you&amp;#39;re no matter

    text: what units you&amp;#39;re looking at measuring
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '2307.96'
    text: distance we might use meters if we
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '2309.48'
    text: measuring temperature we might use
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '2312.2'
    text: Celsius or kelvin if you&amp;#39;re measuring
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '2314.4'
    text: weight you might use
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '2316.16'
    text: kilograms um and the same sort of
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '2318.76'
    text: plotting representations will sort of
  - dur: '3.561'
    start: '2320.079'
    text: work
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '2321.92'
    text: throughout
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2323.64'
    text: uh now this is a practical thing that
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '2326.119'
    text: you should keep in mind and will come up
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '2328.16'
    text: at some point in your future um but when
  - dur: '5'
    start: '2330.52'
    text: we&amp;#39;re talking about the Sciences there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '2333.8'
    text: rules about the units that we&amp;#39;re allowed
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2335.52'
    text: to use um we&amp;#39;re here in a America where
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '2338.079'
    text: we have things like imperial units for
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '2340'
    text: like you know feet and inches and stuff
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '2342'
    text: like that um which are often kind of
  - dur: '3.2'
    start: '2344.72'
    text: people talk about them as like these are
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '2346.319'
    text: Bonkers worthless measurements and they
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '2347.92'
    text: kind of there&amp;#39;s a good argument for that
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '2351.2'
    text: but uh the reality is that a lot of our
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '2353.52'
    text: Imperial the Imperial measurements that
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '2355.48'
    text: we tend to use are based on very
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2358.96'
    text: factorable numbers like 12 and 16
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '2361.64'
    text: because it is easier to do that kind of
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '2363.44'
    text: math in like a home environment um
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '2366.359'
    text: whereas metric is B off of T which is
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '2368.56'
    text: very good for things like decimal points
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '2370.72'
    text: and precision but kind of harder to cut
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '2373.72'
    text: into even so 10 you only get to cut into
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '2376.079'
    text: two and five whereas 12 you get two and
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '2379.24'
    text: five before you start needing things
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '2380.28'
    text: like fractions uh 12 you have one two
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '2383.28'
    text: three four six and 12 um so if you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '2386.8'
    text: imagining that you&amp;#39;re like a vendor in

    text: bunch of Weights that you have to bring
  - dur: '5'
    start: '2391.76'
    text: to measure out your stuff it&amp;#39;s easier to
  - dur: '3.879'
    start: '2394.48'
    text: have stuff weighed in terms of 16s and
  - dur: '2.68'
    start: '2396.76'
    text: 12 like things like baking and stuff
  - dur: '2.641'
    start: '2398.359'
    text: like that is easy because it&amp;#39;s really
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '2399.44'
    text: easy to cut things in half and by Third
  - dur: '7.52'

    text: everything we would need to recreate the

    text: centimeter of water weighs one gram if
  - dur: '2.84'

  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '2588.48'
    text: have since moved away from this method
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '2590.2'
    text: of determining a meter and now use it as
  - dur: '6.601'
    start: '2593.319'
    text: we measure it in terms of the like the
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '2596.68'
    text: distance that light travels so I can&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '5.919'
    start: '2599.92'
    text: remember exactly how we used to do c
  - dur: '5.881'
    start: '2602.079'
    text: seconds um but it was something to do
  - dur: '6.601'
    start: '2605.839'
    text: with like the period perod of a pendulum
  - dur: '7.8'
    start: '2607.96'
    text: of a given length um and we we sense we
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '2612.44'
    text: now we now measure seconds in terms of
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '2615.76'
    text: the oscillation of a cesium atom because
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '2618.76'
    text: it&amp;#39;s a some sort
  - dur: '5.439'
    start: '2621.4'
    text: of quantum thing it&amp;#39;s they oscillate at
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '2625.28'
    text: at a very regular interval and then we
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '2626.839'
    text: measure meters by the distance that
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '2629.24'
    text: light travels in so many oscillations of
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '2632.319'
    text: a cesium atom and that measurement was
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '2635.4'
    text: basically designed as the the time it
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '2637.28'
    text: takes for light to travel this distance
  - dur: '6.681'
    start: '2641.079'
    text: um so that we could be more precise with
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '2643.04'
    text: our more modern uh measurements and
  - dur: '3'
    start: '2653.119'
    text: whatnot
  - dur: '5.439'
    start: '2657.4'
    text: um yeah and then
  - dur: '5'
    start: '2660.96'
    text: these yeah
  - dur: '5.041'
    start: '2662.839'
    text: so so these are the only base units that
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '2665.96'
    text: we have to do proper science so if
  - dur: '3.239'
    start: '2667.88'
    text: you&amp;#39;re ever doing a scientific study or
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '2669.88'
    text: measurement or you have to report
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '2671.119'
    text: numbers you&amp;#39;re not allowed to use inches
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '2674'
    text: you have to use meters you can you can
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '2676.559'
    text: choose to use things like centimeters or
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '2678.16'
    text: millimeters or kilometers or whatever
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '2681'
    text: unit whatever number of zeros Mak sense
  - dur: '4'
    start: '2683.079'
    text: for your measurement but you&amp;#39;re not
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '2684.64'
    text: allowed to use inches or feet or and if
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '2687.079'
    text: you&amp;#39;re measuring mass you&amp;#39;re not allowed
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '2688.96'
    text: to use pounds you have to use kilograms
  - dur: '5.559'
    start: '2691.52'
    text: uh and if you are when I say allowed I
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '2694.119'
    text: mean like the scientific Community has
  - dur: '6.201'
    start: '2697.079'
    text: Creed so like if you&amp;#39;re publishing a
  - dur: '6.159'
    start: '2698.92'
    text: paper in a scientific journal um they
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '2703.28'
    text: should if you were if you present stuff
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '2705.079'
    text: with your numbers and things like feet
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '2706.44'
    text: and pounds they should send it back to
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '2709.16'
    text: you and say convert these to SI units
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '2711.079'
    text: and send it back and if they don&amp;#39;t then
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '2713.119'
    text: I would consider that to be a failure of
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '2714.76'
    text: the peer review process which is its own
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '2717.92'
    text: conversation
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '2719.52'
    text: there um now a thing to notice about
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '2723.599'
    text: this rather rather tur list of possible
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '2726.64'
    text: units
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '2727.68'
    text: is why is just asking yourself like why
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '2730.319'
    text: is it so constrained why are these the
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '2732.559'
    text: numbers that we have um and the answer
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '2735.72'
    text: is it it it if you sort of drill down
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '2738.119'
    text: into it like these are what we consider
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '2740.559'
    text: to be like the short list of measurable
  - dur: '7.879'
    start: '2743.68'
    text: things everything that we can measure
  - dur: '9.921'
    start: '2746.359'
    text: with our basic sort of tools um can boil
  - dur: '5.961'
    start: '2751.559'
    text: down to either these basic quantities or
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '2756.28'
    text: derive
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '2757.52'
    text: more complicated combinations of these
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '2759.88'
    text: con of these quantities so you have time
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '2762.599'
    text: you have spatial extent you have mass
  - dur: '6.559'
    start: '2766'
    text: you have we have electrical current
  - dur: '5.801'
    start: '2769.359'
    text: Kelvin temperature is just uh Kelvin is
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '2772.559'
    text: just celus where zero is at Absolute
  - dur: '7.64'
    start: '2775.16'
    text: Zero um mole is some countable amount
  - dur: '6.599'
    start: '2777.96'
    text: and then Candela is light um so ear when
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '2782.8'
    text: we were talking about like transduction
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '2784.559'
    text: and things like that um in terms of
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '2786.92'
    text: environmental energies and things that
  - dur: '3.319'
    start: '2788.76'
    text: the nervous system wants to take in in
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '2790.44'
    text: order for us to perceive something about
  - dur: '5.441'
    start: '2792.079'
    text: the world this is sort of a roundabout
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '2795.48'
    text: way of thinking about like if you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '2.72'
    start: '2797.52'
    text: measure if you&amp;#39;re thinking about a
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '2798.76'
    text: sensory system and you&amp;#39;re thinking about
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '2800.24'
    text: the energy that it absorbs to give you a
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2803.88'
    text: empirical estimate about what&amp;#39;s in the
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '2805.72'
    text: world you can think about how that you
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '2808.4'
    text: know how does sight how does sound how
  - dur: '7.6'
    start: '2810.04'
    text: does touch how does taste boil down to
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '2813.04'
    text: these basic units
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '2818.559'
    text: you will also quickly discover that if
  - dur: '3.199'
    start: '2820.88'
    text: you&amp;#39;re trying to do anything of Interest
  - dur: '3.879'
    start: '2822.96'
    text: you&amp;#39;re going to these are not really
  - dur: '6'
    start: '2824.079'
    text: going to cut it for you uh for very long
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '2826.839'
    text: because there&amp;#39;s just not much yeah
  - dur: '2.841'
    start: '2830.079'
    text: you&amp;#39;re going to have to eventually come
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '2831.24'
    text: up with new units to measure more
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '2832.92'
    text: interesting things um for example if you
  - dur: '3.401'
    start: '2837.079'
    text: want to measure something like velocity
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '2839.16'
    text: you want to measure how fast something
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '2840.48'
    text: is moving through the world you can&amp;#39;t do
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '2843'
    text: it with these alone but you can do it by
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '2845.4'
    text: starting to squish some of them together
  - dur: '4.481'
    start: '2847.559'
    text: so with velocity we can measure that in
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '2849.28'
    text: terms of meters second by look which is
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '2852.04'
    text: the units are just met per second is the
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '2854.599'
    text: same as meters divided by second so
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '2857.359'
    text: every time there is a second every time
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '2859.52'
    text: a second passes you move this many
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '2861.28'
    text: meters that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s your velocity and
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '2863.839'
    text: so the the SI units for velocity are
  - dur: '2.72'
    start: '2866.52'
    text: meters per second unless you&amp;#39;re going
  - dur: '2.48'
    start: '2867.92'
    text: very slow in which case you might use
  - dur: '2.52'
    start: '2869.24'
    text: millimeters per second or if you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.08'
    start: '2870.4'
    text: going very fast you might want to use
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '2871.76'
    text: kilometers per second but it&amp;#39;s still
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '2873.48'
    text: going to boil down to these SI units
  - dur: '7.199'
    start: '2875.4'
    text: there
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '2878.16'
    text: um and this is where it&amp;#39;s going to start
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '2882.599'
    text: getting
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '2883.88'
    text: towards Neuroscience this is we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.041'
    start: '2886.839'
    text: rapidly approaching the topic of this
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '2888.52'
    text: course which I probably should have sort
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '2889.88'
    text: of specified beforehand um so one of the
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '2892.88'
    text: main sort of Nod nodules in the in that
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '2895.76'
    text: interest space of that of the class is
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '2899.04'
    text: biomechanics sort of you a lot of yall
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '2901.24'
    text: asked about biomechanics like what does
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '2902.839'
    text: that mean and you know whatever whatever
  - dur: '3.08'
    start: '2905.68'
    text: conversations you had with the
  - dur: '6'
    start: '2909.76'
    text: biomechanics is roughly
  - dur: '7.721'
    start: '2912.559'
    text: speaking good oldfashioned Newtonian
  - dur: '6.839'
    start: '2915.76'
    text: physics except as it applies to a wobbly
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '2920.28'
    text: biological system typically one that has
  - dur: '3.161'
    start: '2922.599'
    text: something like a mus like a muscular
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '2924.16'
    text: skeletal
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '2925.76'
    text: system um
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '2929.28'
    text: and we will soon be sort of getting to
  - dur: '2.72'
    start: '2931.839'
    text: the biomechanics and and next week the
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '2933.52'
    text: data that we&amp;#39;re going to be collecting
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '2934.559'
    text: in class is going to involve things like
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '2937.799'
    text: the it&amp;#39;s going to involve standing
  - dur: '5'
    start: '2939.96'
    text: balance so things like like look at this
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '2942.559'
    text: wacky thing that I&amp;#39;m doing with my body
  - dur: '6.119'
    start: '2944.96'
    text: I&amp;#39;m carrying the majority of my mass
  - dur: '5.481'
    start: '2947.799'
    text: some 100 kilograms of salty meat like a
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '2951.079'
    text: meter and a half above the ground which
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2953.28'
    text: is a really insane thing to do and I can
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '2955.4'
    text: hold I can even go onto one foot and now
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '2957.76'
    text: that&amp;#39;s this is a lot of mass being
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '2960'
    text: supported on a couple of Wiggly joints
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '2963.48'
    text: some variable stiffness electric strings
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '2965.52'
    text: called muscles and a base of support
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '2967.799'
    text: that&amp;#39;s like this big if I ever come in
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '2970.2'
    text: if I came in here with like 200 kg of
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '2972.119'
    text: Steel and I put it on something that was
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '2974.28'
    text: that small and raise it Up This Tall
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '2976.76'
    text: that would be a very dangerous thing to
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '2978.48'
    text: do but it&amp;#39;s something that we do with
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '2980.559'
    text: our
  - dur: '6.279'
    start: '2982.04'
    text: bodies a healthy person will do it a
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '2984.72'
    text: million times per year so if you uh
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '2988.319'
    text: 10,000 steps a day let say 20,000 steps
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '2991.24'
    text: a day because you&amp;#39;re grads you talk you
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '2992.64'
    text: walk a lot uh 20,000 time
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '2995.359'
    text: 365 is approaching a million steps per
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '2998.48'
    text: day and so that is a period of time
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '3000.16'
    text: where your the big mass of your body is
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '3002.68'
    text: being supported above the ground because
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '3005.24'
    text: your nervous system is electrifying and
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '3007.119'
    text: firing your muscles in the right way at
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '3009.72'
    text: the appropriate intervals to keep you
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '3011.16'
    text: from falling over and so this is one of
  - dur: '2.48'
    start: '3013.28'
    text: those things that we just we don&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '3.881'
    start: '3014.319'
    text: really think about it but once you start
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '3015.76'
    text: thinking about it there&amp;#39;s a lot going on
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '3018.2'
    text: there and my particular approach to
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '3021.28'
    text: studying this stuff involves kind of
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '3023.599'
    text: like boiling it down to those first
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '3025.16'
    text: principles measuring the behavior in
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '3028.68'
    text: those basic units of geometry and
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '3030.64'
    text: physics and then trying to figure out
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '3032.96'
    text: what we can infer about the UN the
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '3035.28'
    text: unmeasurable parts of that system which
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '3037.16'
    text: is like the neural firings based off of
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '3039.839'
    text: the physics and geometry of the
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '3042.2'
    text: measurable components which is like
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '3044.48'
    text: where is my body at any given point in
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '3046.04'
    text: space so this type of
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '3053.319'
    text: thing

    start: '3055.2'
    text: yeah and so when we talk about things
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '3058.4'
    text: like biomechanics we&amp;#39;re talking about
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '3060.079'
    text: like the physics of of bi physics as
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '3063.28'
    text: applied to organisms in
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '3065.48'
    text: biology
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '3067.119'
    text: um the units we&amp;#39;re going to start
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '3069.44'
    text: talking about are in terms of you know
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '3072.44'
    text: position where am I in space velocity
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '3076.16'
    text: how am I moving in space and then we
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '3078.52'
    text: start getting into sort of fancier terms
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '3080.28'
    text: like force like what forces am I
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '3083.48'
    text: applying to the world like if I&amp;#39;m if I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '7.081'
    start: '3085.599'
    text: standing right here and I push with my
  - dur: '7.28'
    start: '3087.76'
    text: toes I will tilt backwards um if I&amp;#39;m if
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '3092.68'
    text: I push off the table I&amp;#39;ll go that way so
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '3095.04'
    text: I&amp;#39;m applying forces into the world and
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '3097.64'
    text: because I&amp;#39;m I am a massive object
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '3099.64'
    text: putting Force into the world that will
  - dur: '7.48'
    start: '3102.04'
    text: cause me to move um the units for force
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '3105.76'
    text: are Newtons which is kilograms time
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '3109.52'
    text: meters
  - dur: '8.321'
    start: '3110.559'
    text: times uh seconds squared uh so that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '8.56'
    start: '3114.799'
    text: kilogram m/s squar so if you remember we
  - dur: '7.719'
    start: '3118.88'
    text: had acceleration so we had position is
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '3123.359'
    text: in meters velocity is in meters per
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '3126.599'
    text: second uh how many what did your
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '3129.319'
    text: position change how many meter in in one
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '3131.44'
    text: second how many meters did you change
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '3133.96'
    text: velocity uh sorry acceleration is meters
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '3136.4'
    text: per second per second so you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '3138.16'
    text: speeding up uh how how much faster did
  - dur: '6.679'
    start: '3141.44'
    text: you are you going a second from now
  - dur: '7.72'
    start: '3144'
    text: versus right now that&amp;#39;s acceleration
  - dur: '7.841'
    start: '3148.119'
    text: um and then if we sort of jump ahead to
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3151.72'
    text: sort of Newton&amp;#39;s Laws uh Newton&amp;#39;s Laws
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '3155.96'
    text: of
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '3156.72'
    text: Motion you you know Force equals
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '3159.72'
    text: masstimes acceleration we&amp;#39;ve all heard
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '3162.16'
    text: that one before um I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;ll leave this
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '3164.359'
    text: as an exercise to the reader I guess uh
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '3167.24'
    text: if you sit down and if you do Force
  - dur: '3.359'
    start: '3169.44'
    text: equals mass times acceleration if you do
  - dur: '3.041'
    start: '3171.359'
    text: Mass which is in kilograms time
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '3172.799'
    text: acceleration which is meters per second
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3174.4'
    text: squar you will get this unit and we call
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '3178.319'
    text: that unit
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '3179.4'
    text: Newtons um and then if we sort of apply
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '3182.96'
    text: a force over a given distance we have
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '3184.799'
    text: something we call work um work is just
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '3187.559'
    text: force applied over
  - dur: '5.559'
    start: '3189'
    text: distance that gives you kilograms time
  - dur: '5.441'
    start: '3191.599'
    text: meters squared times second squared and
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '3194.559'
    text: that gives and that is a we call that a
  - dur: '7.72'
    start: '3197.04'
    text: jewel uh which is a unit of energy
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '3199.92'
    text: energy is the ability to do work EG the
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '3204.76'
    text: thing that is conserved and we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '3206.04'
    text: talking about the conservation of energy
  - dur: '7.44'
    start: '3209'
    text: uh so if you other famous equation eal
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '3211.72'
    text: MC s if you do that units out you will
  - dur: '8.32'
    start: '3216.44'
    text: you will find that energy in that
  - dur: '9'
    start: '3218.24'
    text: equation is You Know M E equals m c s so
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '3224.76'
    text: energy equals mass in kilogram time C
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '3227.24'
    text: which is the speed of light in meters
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '3228.599'
    text: per second squared you&amp;#39;ll wind up with
  - dur: '6.721'
    start: '3231.559'
    text: one of these things um
  - dur: '6.361'
    start: '3234.559'
    text: so just a good example of how that stuff
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '3238.28'
    text: boils down to SI units and once you&amp;#39;ve
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '3240.92'
    text: gotten to energy we now have now we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '3243.359'
    text: touching this sort of this classic
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3245.079'
    text: physics things of the conservation of
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '3246.799'
    text: energy and this winds up being a very
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '3250.079'
    text: good like this is a phys a law of
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '3252.599'
    text: physics that if you&amp;#39;re observing a
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '3255.119'
    text: system that&amp;#39;s a closed system
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '3257.96'
    text: energy is neither created nor destroyed
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '3260.359'
    text: it just changes form and that&amp;#39;s a really
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '3263.2'
    text: strong belief that that I have that we
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '3266.119'
    text: have physics has been very uh physics
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '3269.96'
    text: has been very adamant that conservation
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '3272.04'
    text: of energy is generally true and so that
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '3274.2'
    text: winds up being a very strong assumption
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '3276.4'
    text: that I can use as a scientist to try to
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '3278.68'
    text: make sense of the wacky data that we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '3280.88'
    text: going to be measuring uh when we start
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '3283.04'
    text: actually looking at the weird goopy
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '3285.04'
    text: complexity of a person moving through
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '3287.24'
    text: space um that doesn&amp;#39;t make sense it
  - dur: '3.121'
    start: '3291.119'
    text: might later or it might not we&amp;#39;ll find
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '3293.119'
    text: out as a
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '3294.24'
    text: group uh
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '3296.799'
    text: yeah normalized units too we can talk
  - dur: '2.601'
    start: '3299.319'
    text: about
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '3300.4'
    text: '[Music]'
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '3301.92'
    text: um yeah
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '3304.96'
    text: so I won&amp;#39;t say too much about this I&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '3307.2'
    text: just say it in passing but
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '3309.799'
    text: uh even though there are things even
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '3312.16'
    text: though like SI units you use SI units
  - dur: '3.121'
    start: '3314.359'
    text: for things like kill for things like
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '3315.799'
    text: Mass if you&amp;#39;re doing something like
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '3317.48'
    text: measuring a person moving through space
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '3319.839'
    text: and you measuring like like this is me
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '3322.079'
    text: walking around and this is me like
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '3323.52'
    text: pushing off the ground and um
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '3330.16'
    text: second uh you know putting Force into
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '3332.44'
    text: the ground stuff like that um it might
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '3334.64'
    text: stop it might like measuring everything
  - dur: '3.039'
    start: '3336.76'
    text: in terms of kilogram starts to get
  - dur: '3.879'
    start: '3338.2'
    text: annoying because it&amp;#39;s like oh I&amp;#39;m 100
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '3339.799'
    text: kilograms or whatever I&amp;#39;ve said I think
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '3342.079'
    text: I said 200 but it&amp;#39;s not not that um uh
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '3346.839'
    text: because we&amp;#39;re thinking about the we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '3348.119'
    text: we&amp;#39;re studying a a person so we can make
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '3351.119'
    text: our math and our lives much easier by
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '3353.48'
    text: just dividing all of our our Mass
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '3355.88'
    text: measurement by my personal body weight
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '3359.119'
    text: like how much my Mass is in kilograms
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '3362.28'
    text: and so then we&amp;#39;re no longer using things
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '3364.359'
    text: like kilograms everywhere we&amp;#39;re now
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3366.2'
    text: talking about things like body masses
  - dur: '6.121'
    start: '3368.039'
    text: body weights or whatever um weight is
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '3371.2'
    text: actually a measure of uh force not mass
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '3374.16'
    text: but um and so we can do we basically so
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '3377.559'
    text: that we would say we would normalize
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '3379.319'
    text: mass by the participants by the subject
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '3382.359'
    text: by the person&amp;#39;s body mass so now we have
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '3385'
    text: a one when looking at our units we get
  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '3387.52'
    text: we get the number one which is a very
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '3388.799'
    text: convenient unit because you can kind of
  - dur: '3.399'
    start: '3390.64'
    text: it makes the math sort of work out
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '3394.2'
    text: easier
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '3396.88'
    text: um okay so now we
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '3403.799'
    text: have okay so we&amp;#39;re going to now we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '3405.96'
    text: we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re inching our way
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '3408.2'
    text: towards a human and we this we&amp;#39;re we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '3412.16'
    text: the conception of human as as one of
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '3414'
    text: these approximations not one of these
  - dur: '6.319'
    start: '3416.76'
    text: this is too complicated let&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '6.159'
    start: '3418.16'
    text: going to stick with this um and by
  - dur: '3.161'
    start: '3423.079'
    text: getting we&amp;#39;ve gotten through all that
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '3424.319'
    text: spatial stuff all that measurement stuff
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '3426.24'
    text: all that unit stuff and now we can start
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '3427.96'
    text: thinking in terms of of physics now
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '3431.28'
    text: physics is just it&amp;#39;s the sort of the
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '3433.839'
    text: math of the description of how objects
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '3436.44'
    text: move through the world and there&amp;#39;s all
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '3437.599'
    text: sorts of different layers of physics and
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '3440.2'
    text: the layer that I tend to hang out in is
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '3442.359'
    text: what&amp;#39;s called classical mechanics where
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '3444.96'
    text: classical mechanics is B basically
  - dur: '8.52'
    start: '3447.24'
    text: Newton&amp;#39;s three laws as they apply
  - dur: '6.559'
    start: '3451.52'
    text: to simple sort of mechanical objects so
  - dur: '5.559'
    start: '3455.76'
    text: it&amp;#39;s basically like Cannonball
  - dur: '7'
    start: '3458.079'
    text: physics um now this is also a fun
  - dur: '7.081'
    start: '3461.319'
    text: example of like
  - dur: '6.561'
    start: '3465.079'
    text: a a philosophy of science concept which
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '3468.4'
    text: is that our all everything all of our
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '3471.64'
    text: theories are wrong at any at all points
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '3474.079'
    text: at all points in time um so Newton&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '7.479'
    start: '3476.88'
    text: Laws came about in I want to say like
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '3479.92'
    text: 1700s or something like that uh and he
  - dur: '5.041'
    start: '3484.359'
    text: was trying to understand the motion of
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '3486.2'
    text: the planets um and so he came up with
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '3489.4'
    text: these simple rules of sort of how
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '3492.24'
    text: mechanics tends the works and it was
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '3494.359'
    text: very useful and it explains a lot of the
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '3496.799'
    text: physical world it explains a lot of sort
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '3500.28'
    text: of simple objects in the world and you
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '3503.079'
    text: can derive their trajectories through
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '3505.76'
    text: space
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '3506.68'
    text: using Newtonian mechanics it and it
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '3509'
    text: explains the majority of the planetary
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '3511.559'
    text: motions but it doesn&amp;#39;t do a good job of
  - dur: '6.681'
    start: '3514.319'
    text: of predicting the movement of a planet
  - dur: '6.281'
    start: '3517.119'
    text: like Mercury and it was actually so and
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '3521'
    text: if and if and even in that day they if
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '3523.4'
    text: they applied the Newtonian predictions
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3526.079'
    text: for Planet
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '3527.44'
    text: trajectories it didn&amp;#39;t the uh Mercury&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '3531.079'
    text: orbit didn&amp;#39;t line up with the prediction
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '3533.52'
    text: so they actually postulated for a long
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '3536.16'
    text: time that there was a another planet
  - dur: '5.841'

  - dur: '5.439'

  - dur: '3.401'

  - dur: '5'
    start: '3605.079'
    text: you use Newton&amp;#39;s Laws is like nine de
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '3608.48'
    text: it&amp;#39;s like decimal place like 9 10
  - dur: '4.76'

    text: decimal places out uh so you start like

    text: this Ball&amp;#39;s Motion in Newtonian
  - dur: '7.16'

    text: our ability to measure the position
  - dur: '6'
    start: '3628.319'
    text: it just those numers you only relativity
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '3633'
    text: when you start looking at things like
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '3634.319'
    text: planets on the scales of you know stars
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '3637.2'
    text: and stuff like that so we still use
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '3639.92'
    text: Newtonian Mechanics for almost
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '3642.24'

    text: even though we know that that is not as

    start: '3647.44'
    text: accurate as something like relativistic
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '3651.559'
    text: physics and there&amp;#39;s a lot to be said
  - dur: '6.361'
    start: '3654.559'
    text: there but let&amp;#39;s let&amp;#39;s keep
  - dur: '6'
    start: '3657.4'
    text: movement um so yeah so Newton&amp;#39;s Laws
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '3660.92'
    text: there&amp;#39;s three of them a body the first
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '3663.4'
    text: law is a body in rest or in motion tends
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '3665.839'
    text: to stay in rest or in motion so that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '3667.88'
    text: inertia things in motion tend to stay in
  - dur: '7.44'
    start: '3670'
    text: motion unless acted upon by a force the
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '3673.48'
    text: second one arguably my favorite is force
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '3677.44'
    text: equals mass times acceleration or if
  - dur: '4.039'
    start: '3680'
    text: you&amp;#39;re in rotational space it&amp;#39;s torque
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '3682.079'
    text: equals moment of inertia times angular
  - dur: '7.241'
    start: '3684.039'
    text: acceleration but don&amp;#39;t worry about that
  - dur: '7.439'
    start: '3686.68'
    text: um so fals ma is a very very useful
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '3691.28'
    text: equation uh basically so if you look at
  - dur: '6.281'
    start: '3694.119'
    text: me I am a mass uh my Mass is not
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '3697.079'
    text: changing so let&amp;#39;s just Let&amp;#39;s ignore the
  - dur: '3.719'
    start: '3700.4'
    text: M of that because it&amp;#39;s not doing
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '3702.16'
    text: anything it&amp;#39;s a constant so let&amp;#39;s divide
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '3704.119'
    text: by my body weight and then we have Force
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '3706.64'
    text: equals acceleration
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '3708.96'
    text: so I&amp;#39;m not moving I&amp;#39;m not accelerating
  - dur: '6.039'
    start: '3712.52'
    text: that means that the sum of forces acting
  - dur: '7.639'
    start: '3714.72'
    text: on my body has to equals z if it if it
  - dur: '6.841'
    start: '3718.559'
    text: if it didn&amp;#39;t I would be moving now I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '5.041'
    start: '3722.359'
    text: going to I&amp;#39;m going to so all the pluses
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '3725.4'
    text: and the minus have to add up to zero in
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '3727.4'
    text: order for that to to
  - dur: '7.401'
    start: '3730.039'
    text: work
  - dur: '8.561'
    start: '3731.839'
    text: um and you can see if I I like soften my
  - dur: '6.679'
    start: '3737.44'
    text: oh let me do this backwards the third
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '3740.4'
    text: the third law is for every action there
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '3744.119'
    text: is an equal and opposite reaction you
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '3746.079'
    text: have an action and a reaction force so
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '3748.68'
    text: here I am standing look we&amp;#39;re officially
  - dur: '6.361'
    start: '3752.839'
    text: doing Neuroscience that&amp;#39;s me I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '7.64'
    start: '3755.24'
    text: standing and I&amp;#39;m standing on the ground
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '3759.2'
    text: and I weigh one body mass and I am being
  - dur: '7.88'
    start: '3762.88'
    text: pulled down by this horrible Planet at a
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '3766.16'
    text: rate of G if you drop me from a c from a
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '3770.76'
    text: place up high I would accelerate
  - dur: '7.119'
    start: '3772.72'
    text: downward at 9.8 meters per second
  - dur: '7.161'
    start: '3775.319'
    text: squared let&amp;#39;s call it 10 uh
  - dur: '7.321'
    start: '3779.839'
    text: and and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s always happening
  - dur: '11'
    start: '3782.48'
    text: at all times um but so this Force so so
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '3787.16'
    text: G is 9.8 m/s
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '3794.4'
    text: squared uh so that&amp;#39;s the A and the f
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '3797.279'
    text: equals Ma and I&amp;#39;m move and I&amp;#39;m so I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '3799.799'
    text: being pulled down by that amount but I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '3802.16'
    text: not moving so the so there must be
  - dur: '2.921'
    start: '3804.839'
    text: something else pushing
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '3807.839'
    text: back with exactly the same force and
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '3810.839'
    text: that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s our good friend the ground
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '3813.319'
    text: the ground is a very useful object it
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '3816.24'
    text: allows us to complete most of our goals
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '3819.16'
    text: and as I am pushing this is the action I
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '3821.96'
    text: am pushing into the ground with mass
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '3824.88'
    text: times Gravity Force and the ground is
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '3827.279'
    text: dutifully pushing back with exactly
  - dur: '7.8'
    start: '3830.4'
    text: negative masstimes Gravity Force
  - dur: '6.601'
    start: '3834.319'
    text: great if I ever decide to break this
  - dur: '6.919'
    start: '3838.2'
    text: equation I can push if I like if I
  - dur: '7.159'
    start: '3840.92'
    text: decide to push off the ground with more
  - dur: '5.521'
    start: '3845.119'
    text: than that than
  - dur: '5.441'
    start: '3848.079'
    text: than more than gravity is pulling me
  - dur: '5.439'
    start: '3850.64'
    text: then I can do such a wacky thing is jump
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '3853.52'
    text: so I put Force into the ground it&amp;#39;s more
  - dur: '8.04'
    start: '3856.079'
    text: than I weigh I briefly airborne and then
  - dur: '7.321'
    start: '3859.359'
    text: gravity pulls me back down um and
  - dur: '7.641'
    start: '3864.119'
    text: that winds up being important for a lot
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '3866.68'
    text: of stuff okay I need to speed up here
  - dur: '3'
    start: '3879.64'
    text: um
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '3885.359'
    text: okay okay I think I know how this is
  - dur: '2.32'
    start: '3887.4'
    text: going to
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3890.92'
    text: go so
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '3901.96'
    text: great so this is our this is your uh
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '3904.559'
    text: preview of high level human movement
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '3907.839'
    text: Neuroscience um but we gotta we got to
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '3910.48'
    text: do a little more work before we can get
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '3911.96'
    text: into the the meat there let&amp;#39;s go back to
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '3914.559'
    text: thinking about
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '3916.2'
    text: simple simple spheroids um such as
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '3919.68'
    text: brightly colored juggling
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '3921.68'
    text: balls
  - dur: '3.521'
    start: '3924.119'
    text: um so
  - dur: '2.361'
    start: '3929.279'
    text: yeah so when you&amp;#39;re doing empirical
  - dur: '2.599'
    start: '3930.52'
    text: studies you&amp;#39;re doing empirical
  - dur: '3.04'
    start: '3931.64'
    text: measurements you always have to make
  - dur: '2.72'
    start: '3933.119'
    text: assumptions that&amp;#39;s always going to be a
  - dur: '2.399'
    start: '3934.68'
    text: thing that you&amp;#39;re doing you have to make
  - dur: '3.041'
    start: '3935.839'
    text: assumptions that your senses aren&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '3.561'
    start: '3937.079'
    text: lying to you at all times you make
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '3938.88'
    text: assumptions that when you read papers
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '3940.64'
    text: that the people who did that study are
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '3942.76'
    text: not actively lying to you and falsifying
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '3944.68'
    text: all their data um you have to make
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '3947.559'
    text: assumptions
  - dur: '3.361'
    start: '3950.039'
    text: about yeah and every time you make an
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '3951.96'
    text: assumption you get a little bit more
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '3953.4'
    text: predictive power um
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '3956.359'
    text: so if I if I&amp;#39;m trying to measure my body
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '3959.279'
    text: moving through space I know that this is
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '3962.559'
    text: like a wobbly meaty thing and I know
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '3965.079'
    text: that the distance between my elbow and
  - dur: '6.68'
    start: '3967.76'
    text: my wrist changes ever so slightly
  - dur: '6.92'
    start: '3971.24'
    text: because I am made of squishy meat but if
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '3974.44'
    text: I just assume that I&amp;#39;m that that that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.439'
    start: '3978.16'
    text: just not happening and that I&amp;#39;m actually
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '3979.92'
    text: composed of rigid bodies that don&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '3981.599'
    text: change length then I get a lot I get a
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '3984.4'
    text: lot my math gets easier because now I
  - dur: '3.321'
    start: '3986.559'
    text: don&amp;#39;t have to measure the length between
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '3988.24'
    text: these things I only have to meure the
  - dur: '7.84'
    start: '3989.88'
    text: angles between them um and so those
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '3994.76'
    text: assumptions that we make and wind the
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '3997.72'
    text: only the only measurement you can make
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '3999.44'
    text: without making assumptions is that you
  - dur: '2.919'
    start: '4001.64'
    text: are having a conscious experience at
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '4003.119'
    text: this exact moment and that&amp;#39;s just not
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '4004.559'
    text: very useful um so this is where we come
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '4007.839'
    text: back to what I was talking about earlier
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '4009.119'
    text: where this the idea of a conservation of
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '4011.319'
    text: energy winds up being one of those very
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '4013.96'
    text: very powerful and very very useful
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '4016.44'
    text: assumptions that can really get us a lot
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '4018.039'
    text: of the way towards understanding the
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '4020.48'
    text: things that we care about the desiderata
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4022.72'
    text: of our research goals the things that is
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '4024.96'
    text: desired in our research
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '4027.76'
    text: activity
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '4029.279'
    text: um because again looking at this object
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '4032.799'
    text: there&amp;#39;s a lot like if if my desire is to
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4035.359'
    text: understand something like standing
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '4036.48'
    text: posture or God forbid
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '4038.359'
    text: Locomotion uh there&amp;#39;s a lot there there
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4041.799'
    text: there are many many aspects of that
  - dur: '2.879'
    start: '4043.44'
    text: question that I cannot measure
  - dur: '3.721'
    start: '4044.799'
    text: empirically I just don&amp;#39;t have the
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '4046.319'
    text: technological capacity to measure the
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '4048.52'
    text: firing in my cerebellum or the stretch
  - dur: '4.8'

    text: fidly bits um and this is going to fuz
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '4083.52'

  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '4086.119'
    text: sort of like we&amp;#39;ll pick up I get
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '4087.48'
    text: probably around here next week um but
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '4089.799'
    text: I&amp;#39;m going to get through it all so that
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '4091.64'
    text: at least it&amp;#39;s at least you will have
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '4093.4'
    text: experienced it at least one time um so
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '4097.239'
    text: when you&amp;#39;re thinking about when you&amp;#39;re

    text: doing sort of a mechanical analysis of a
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '4102.52'
    text: person um you can you want to think
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '4105.799'
    text: about what are the forms of energy that
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '4107.679'
    text: are relevant to this task that I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '7.56'
    start: '4109.96'
    text: looking at here um and in this part of
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '4114.279'
    text: the class we&amp;#39;re just measuring movement
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '4117.52'
    text: the motor control part we&amp;#39;re not looking
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '4119.12'
    text: at perception we&amp;#39;re not looking at
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '4120.48'
    text: Vision so we get to ignore things like
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '4122.64'
    text: light and we get to focus on just the
  - dur: '6.719'
    start: '4124.56'
    text: simple physics of being a massive object
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '4129.12'
    text: in a world that has such things as
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '4131.279'
    text: ground and gravity and so the forms of
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '4135.08'
    text: energy that we can really measure and we
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '4136.759'
    text: can really care about are mostly
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '4140.679'
    text: potential energy and kinetic energy and
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '4142.839'
    text: there&amp;#39;s a lot of forms of potential
  - dur: '6.841'
    start: '4144.239'
    text: energy um the most obvious and easy one
  - dur: '6.919'
    start: '4146.88'
    text: is gravitational potential energy which
  - dur: '6.92'
    start: '4151.08'
    text: is the distance so this is the ground
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '4153.799'
    text: we&amp;#39;ll call that the height is zero you
  - dur: '3.759'
    start: '4158'
    text: got to do that doesn&amp;#39;t matter where we
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '4159.96'
    text: are horizontally but it does matter
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '4161.759'
    text: where we are vertically and so po
  - dur: '7.08'
    start: '4165.44'
    text: potential energy gravitation potential
  - dur: '7.319'
    start: '4167.92'
    text: energy equals mass gravity height so
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4172.52'
    text: which again mass is kilogram meters per
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '4175.239'
    text: second squared height is again in meters
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '4177.56'
    text: you can do the math and figure out that
  - dur: '4.239'
    start: '4179.52'
    text: this the units will be Newtons when you
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '4181.48'
    text: do that and so the potential energy is
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '4183.759'
    text: basically a measurement of if I had this
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '4186.56'
    text: object and I dropped it the force that
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '4189.12'
    text: it would that if I put like a scale
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '4190.679'
    text: underneath that the force that it would
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '4193.08'
    text: put into that scale is
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '4195.96'
    text: this many
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4197.12'
    text: newtons
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '4200.76'
    text: um yeah other forms of potential energy
  - dur: '2.72'
    start: '4203.56'
    text: which we&amp;#39;re not really going to talk as
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '4204.679'
    text: much about are things like spring
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '4206.28'
    text: potential energy so if like stretchiness
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '4208.159'
    text: of a spring also chemical potential
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '4210.56'
    text: energy which is like food and bombs and
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '4213.239'
    text: gasoline and stuff like that a lot of
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '4214.84'
    text: the sort of the deeper level biology
  - dur: '2.2'
    start: '4217.88'
    text: you&amp;#39;re going to start getting into
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '4218.76'
    text: chemical potential energy and that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '4220.08'
    text: when you start things seeing things like
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '4222.28'
    text: the ion charges don&amp;#39;t line up so there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '4224.56'
    text: ex that&amp;#39;s you start measuring into the
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '4226.4'
    text: colums or whatever that electrical unit
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '4228.8'
    text: is so that&amp;#39;s the potential energy is
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '4231.56'
    text: like a mismatch between the way that the
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '4234.56'
    text: world would really prefer to be and the
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '4236.96'
    text: way that the world currently is so the
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '4239.28'
    text: low energy state if I wasn&amp;#39;t holding
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '4241.12'
    text: this the low energy state of the world
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '4243.239'
    text: would be this on the ground and so if I
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '4245.8'
    text: let go then I know how much energy is
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '4248.8'
    text: going to be hit there da da d da um the
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '4251.96'
    text: other one to think about is kinetic
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '4253.36'
    text: energy which is the physics of M M so if
  - dur: '6'
    start: '4257.239'
    text: you were to
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '4258.92'
    text: measure yeah so kinetic energy
  - dur: '7.52'
    start: '4263.48'
    text: is
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '4265.76'
    text: half kinetic energy 12 met MV squ 1 12
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '4271'
    text: MV
  - dur: '6.279'
    start: '4271.92'
    text: squ at mass is kilograms velocity is
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4275.96'
    text: meters per second do the math I promise
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '4278.199'
    text: you it will turn out to be Newtons
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4279.96'
    text: because it&amp;#39;s a measure of force and it
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '4282'
    text: is the amount of force that would be
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '4283.96'
    text: hit like if I were to drop this the
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '4286.84'
    text: instantaneous moment before it hits the
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4288.52'
    text: ground it would be
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '4291.159'
    text: having the an how it would have a
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '4293.56'
    text: certain amount of kinetic energy how
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '4295.239'
    text: much kinetic energy would it have it
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '4296.92'
    text: would have exactly the same amount of
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '4298.84'
    text: kinetic energy as it had potential
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '4301.04'
    text: energy before I dropped it and if you
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '4305.48'
    text: add these things
  - dur: '7.08'
    start: '4307.48'
    text: together oh no not do
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4310.56'
    text: that and
  - dur: '3.401'
    start: '4317.679'
    text: yeah and so
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '4321.96'
    text: using that type of analysis potential
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '4325.48'
    text: and kinetic energy is where you get
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '4327.36'
    text: things like the parabolic Flight of the
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '4329.96'
    text: object through space because as it
  - dur: '2.6'
    start: '4331.96'
    text: leaves my
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '4335.92'
    text: hand it has the instantaneous moment
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '4338.639'
    text: that it breaks contact with my hand and
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '4340.32'
    text: it&amp;#39;s in Free Flight it has a certain
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4342.56'
    text: amount of kinetic energy and it has the
  - dur: '3.399'
    start: '4344.8'
    text: most energy that it&amp;#39;s going to have for
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '4346.56'
    text: this entire
  - dur: '6.361'
    start: '4348.199'
    text: trajectory uh has maximum kinetic energy
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '4351.52'
    text: minimum potential energy and it goes up
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '4354.56'
    text: through space the kinetic energy it
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '4356.719'
    text: slows down as it goes up and it gets
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '4359.28'
    text: higher so the potential energy increases
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '4362.12'
    text: until it reaches a point where it&amp;#39;s at
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4363.88'
    text: the Apex and the potential energy is now
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '4366.36'
    text: at the max because it&amp;#39;s as high as it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '8.04'
    start: '4368.4'
    text: going to get the kinetic energy is at
  - dur: '7.48'
    start: '4371.719'
    text: the minimum because it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s briefly
  - dur: '6.88'
    start: '4376.44'
    text: uh it briely has zero velocity when it
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '4379.199'
    text: goes from moving up to moving down um
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '4383.32'
    text: and then it&amp;#39;s going to come back the
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '4384.679'
    text: other way and when it hits when it gets
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '4387.48'
    text: right the moment right the moment right
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '4389.04'
    text: over hit the ground hits my hand again
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '4391.4'
    text: it will have the same amount of kinetic
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '4392.88'
    text: energy as it had when it started so you
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '4395.6'
    text: get this
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '4397.48'
    text: nice sort of trade-off there so this is
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4400.639'
    text: a much so when I talked about things
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '4402.199'
    text: like transduction for for vision
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '4405.639'
    text: or for action or for somata sensation or
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '4409.159'
    text: things like that we&amp;#39;re talking about a
  - dur: '5.719'
    start: '4411'
    text: transfer of energy from one form for
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '4414'
    text: light let&amp;#39;s say Candelas into another
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4416.719'
    text: form which is a pattern of neural
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '4419.199'
    text: activity measured by voltages and
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '4421.719'
    text: electron ion mismatches and stuff like
  - dur: '7.52'
    start: '4423.96'
    text: that um there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s so much that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '4427.679'
    text: not measurable in that conversion um but
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '4431.48'
    text: physics would have us believe that if
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '4433.04'
    text: you could tally up every
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '4435.56'
    text: ion and every sort of quantum of of
  - dur: '6.121'
    start: '4438.239'
    text: energy the math of that conversion would
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '4441.44'
    text: match would would work out as perfectly
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '4444.36'
    text: as The Cannonball physics of simple
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '4447.12'
    text: ballistic motion does um because this
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '4450'
    text: transition from kinetic potential energy
  - dur: '4.241'
    start: '4452.159'
    text: is also transduction that is also a
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '4454.28'
    text: transfer of energy from one form to
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '4456.4'
    text: another
  - dur: '7.08'
    start: '4458.88'
    text: um yeah uh we&amp;#39;re ignoring if I was a
  - dur: '6.239'
    start: '4462.48'
    text: bird I could flap my wings and push
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4465.96'
    text: against air sufficiently to get a
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '4468.719'
    text: reaction force to sort of counteract
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '4470.96'
    text: gravity um if
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '4474.08'
    text: I if this was a pogo stick and I sort of
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '4477.36'
    text: compressed it and then threw it then it
  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '4479.48'
    text: hit then it would have a bunch of spring
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '4480.88'
    text: potential energy that when it hit the
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '4482.6'
    text: ground it might bounce additionally but
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '4485.159'
    text: if we assume the simple rigid body uh
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '4488.52'
    text: physics then that kinetic and potential
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '4491.639'
    text: energy is going to sort
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '4493.28'
    text: of yeah have this nice conservative
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '4496.08'
    text: tradeoff this will become important
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4498.4'
    text: later
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4502.639'
    text: um
  - dur: '5.721'
    start: '4505.719'
    text: so now we get to my favorite part um
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '4509.32'
    text: which I will will only be just a little
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4511.44'
    text: taster uh and then we will talk at about
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '4513.88'
    text: this at length next time and that&amp;#39;s the
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '4515.96'
    text: concept of the center of mass um the
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '4518.48'
    text: center of mass is a term in physics you
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '4521.84'
    text: probably heard it in some it comes up a
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '4524.56'
    text: lot in like uh you know Sports and
  - dur: '2.879'
    start: '4528.28'
    text: especially anything related like
  - dur: '3.319'
    start: '4529.4'
    text: gymnastics and balance stuff like that
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '4531.159'
    text: you hear people talk about the center of
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '4532.719'
    text: mass as um like the position of your
  - dur: '6.681'
    start: '4537.199'
    text: body
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4538.88'
    text: um run out of time here I&amp;#39;ll just do
  - dur: '11.201'
    start: '4544.639'
    text: it so the center of mass is um the
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '4549.92'
    text: average position of all of the oops
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '4557.08'
    text: excuse me is the average position of all
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4560.44'
    text: of the objects of all the components of
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '4563.44'
    text: the larger object so if I were to take
  - dur: '6.92'
    start: '4565.36'
    text: this tube and cut it up into 1 cm long
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '4569.32'
    text: sections and then took the position of
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '4572.28'
    text: those sections relative to a zero point
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '4575.88'
    text: or any zero point and took the average
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4577.92'
    text: of all of them it would be in the middle
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '4579.96'
    text: of the thing and that is the center of
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '4582.44'
    text: mass and it turns out that when you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4584.4'
    text: supporting something above the ground
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '4586.32'
    text: you do it by supporting the center of
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '4588.92'
    text: mass of the thing so if I were to hold
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '4590.8'
    text: it over here then the center of mass
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '4593.04'
    text: would fall and it wouldn&amp;#39;t stay on my
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4595.36'
    text: hand
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '4598.8'
    text: um if I were to
  - dur: '3.281'
    start: '4602.679'
    text: put a
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '4607.04'
    text: weight so these are like ankle weights
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '4610.28'
    text: they look like they&amp;#39;re from like the
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4611.36'
    text: '&amp;#39;90s I also found them on the street'
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '4614.52'
    text: near my house there&amp;#39;s like a place for
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '4616.4'
    text: people in the neighborhood just like put
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '4618.12'
    text: sort of like garbage before like before
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '4621.679'
    text: it goes away um and I found these and
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '4623.92'
    text: they&amp;#39;re sort of useful for this so by
  - dur: '6.199'
    start: '4626.96'
    text: putting this it weighs like a pound I
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '4629.6'
    text: think so like half a kilogram um and so
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '4633.159'
    text: now before it was on here this thing was
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '4634.96'
    text: of uniform density so the center of mass
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '4637.36'
    text: was in the middle of it now it&amp;#39;s not of
  - dur: '3.761'
    start: '4639.639'
    text: uniform density so the center of mass
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4641.6'
    text: shifts
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4643.4'
    text: to here now this is the center of mass
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '4646.52'
    text: of the system so now when I want to
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4647.92'
    text: support the system I have to take into
  - dur: '5.559'
    start: '4650.08'
    text: account the shift and density of all the
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '4653.44'
    text: things that are a part of that
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4655.639'
    text: system
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '4659.32'
    text: um and so if we really wanted to we
  - dur: '6.92'
    start: '4662.44'
    text: could determine how much this thing
  - dur: '6.881'
    start: '4665.199'
    text: weighs in units of stick by measuring
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '4669.36'
    text: the distance between this balance point
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '4672.08'
    text: and the center of the stick which is
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '4673.6'
    text: where we would balance it on if it it
  - dur: '7.96'
    start: '4675.239'
    text: was symmetrically oriented like
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '4679.28'
    text: that um I don&amp;#39;t want to but we
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '4683.199'
    text: could
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4684.92'
    text: uh
  - dur: '7.719'
    start: '4688.44'
    text: and that concept of balance as the
  - dur: '5.759'
    start: '4692.92'
    text: relationship between the center of mass
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '4696.159'
    text: and the base of support is something
  - dur: '6.121'
    start: '4698.679'
    text: we&amp;#39;re going to talk about a
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4700.8'
    text: lot uh
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '4708.679'
    text: yeah but
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '4710.639'
    text: um but yeah
  - dur: '5.919'
    start: '4712.8'
    text: so similarly so we talked a little bit
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '4715.96'
    text: about um the concept of like
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '4718.719'
    text: reductionist approaches to Scientific
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '4721.52'
    text: studies which is like trying
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '4724.28'
    text: to trying to nail down like that the
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '4728.36'
    text: problem I said before like I&amp;#39;m I want to
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4730.12'
    text: measure this thing that I care about but
  - dur: '3.559'
    start: '4731.6'
    text: I don&amp;#39;t have the ability to measure all
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '4733.12'
    text: the parts of it with the precis that I
  - dur: '6.801'
    start: '4735.159'
    text: need to do that one approach to to
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '4738.36'
    text: dealing with that problem is to narrow
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '4741.96'
    text: your focus and rather than trying to
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '4743.52'
    text: explain the entire complexity of the
  - dur: '3.359'
    start: '4745.8'
    text: thing that&amp;#39;s moving which is not
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '4747.04'
    text: available for empirical measurement you
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '4749.159'
    text: can look at a smaller and smaller and
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4750.48'
    text: smaller piece of it um and so instead of
  - dur: '3.399'
    start: '4753.28'
    text: looking at the whole body you might sort
  - dur: '3.199'
    start: '4755'
    text: of look at just the movement of like a
  - dur: '4.241'
    start: '4756.679'
    text: single joint or something like that or
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '4758.199'
    text: the single arm or something like that um
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '4760.92'
    text: and keep that same sort of full level of
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '4762.84'
    text: fidelity of still thinking about this
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '4765'
    text: weird shape in you in terms of like a
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '4767.6'
    text: thing that has all of these joint angles
  - dur: '3.481'
    start: '4769.639'
    text: that can Define it its position at a
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4771.76'
    text: given point in
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '4773.12'
    text: time um but even for something like this
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '4776.76'
    text: which is a a massive simplification of
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '4779.84'
    text: of of a human this is still a pretty
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '4782.48'
    text: complex object physically speaking like
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '4784.639'
    text: there&amp;#39;s still a lot of joints that can
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '4786.84'
    text: vary and you have as many degrees of
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '4790'
    text: freedom as you have joints times two or
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '4792.719'
    text: three depending on how you count so
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '4794.76'
    text: Define the position the the ident the
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '4797.12'
    text: position of this kinematic object in
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '4800.12'
    text: space requires a lot of different
  - dur: '4.521'
    start: '4802.239'
    text: numbers and that&amp;#39;s going to be sort of
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '4803.84'
    text: hard to deal with um the other approach
  - dur: '5.959'
    start: '4806.76'
    text: is to just simplify down the system that
  - dur: '6.199'
    start: '4809.04'
    text: you&amp;#39;re looking at into a a massive
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '4812.719'
    text: oversimplification um and and try to do
  - dur: '3.041'
    start: '4815.239'
    text: that in such a way that still allows you
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '4816.679'
    text: to say things about the system as a
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '4818.28'
    text: whole so like and that&amp;#39;s basically what
  - dur: '4.479'
    start: '4820.76'
    text: the idea of the center of mass is so
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '4823.08'
    text: rather than thinking about
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4825.239'
    text: this whole complex thing with all the
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '4827.44'
    text: joints and all the muscles and all the
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '4829.239'
    text: the blood pumping and all the sort of
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '4830.84'
    text: the the biological realities going on
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '4833.32'
    text: there um we can instead uh condense it
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4836.92'
    text: down
  - dur: '5.21'
    start: '4842.27'
    text: '[Music]'
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '4844.56'
    text: into a simplified system so this is
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '4847.48'
    text: something I made some years ago um and
  - dur: '5.439'
    start: '4850.8'
    text: this is just showing a guy
  - dur: '8.04'
    start: '4852.679'
    text: doing a handstands a French parkour
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '4856.239'
    text: Vista named simonster and the X here is
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '4860.719'
    text: his full body Center of mass which is
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '4863.199'
    text: measured as the weighted sum of each of
  - dur: '6.281'
    start: '4865.159'
    text: these body segments so the segment of
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '4868.679'
    text: the forearm the the upper arm the head
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '4871.44'
    text: the chest the legs you take the average
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4873.96'
    text: of all those positions uh weighted by
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '4876.56'
    text: the mass of that object so like the
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '4879.48'
    text: forearm weighs a lot less than the legs
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '4881.4'
    text: for example this is the position that
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '4883.679'
    text: you get and then if you measure the
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4885.36'
    text: limits of the base of support here um as
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '4888.44'
    text: the the distance between the tips of his
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '4890.36'
    text: fingers to the heel of his hand which
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '4892.639'
    text: those are the places where you can put
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '4894'
    text: Force into the ground the center of mass
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '4896.6'
    text: always stays within that space so you
  - dur: '5.721'
    start: '4899.199'
    text: can know that even though there&amp;#39;s a lot
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '4902.28'
    text: going on here biologically from a
  - dur: '5.239'
    start: '4904.92'
    text: physics perspective that you can Define
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4907.76'
    text: the task of balance using these sort of
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '4910.159'
    text: very hyper simplified models of the body
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '4912.76'
    text: which take the entire complexity of a
  - dur: '3.881'
    start: '4914.719'
    text: human person and boil it down to a
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '4916.8'
    text: singular Point Mass which in this case
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '4918.6'
    text: is in two Dimensions but it could be in
  - dur: '5.761'
    start: '4920.719'
    text: three dimensions and we have now
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '4923.8'
    text: um simplified the world down to a place
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '4926.48'
    text: that starts to feel more
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '4928.04'
    text: tractable uh I can handle this many
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '4930.84'
    text: numbers I can&amp;#39;t I can kind of handle
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '4933.6'
    text: this many numbers but not really um but
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '4937.199'
    text: this is a place
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '4939.32'
    text: where uh if you by the way in on the
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '4942.4'
    text: list on the the notes if you click on on
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '4944.92'
    text: this where is
  - dur: '6.121'
    start: '4948.199'
    text: it
  - dur: '6'
    start: '4950.6'
    text: uh Co gifts it goes to a link to a bunch
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '4954.32'
    text: of those types of animations that I made
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '4956.6'
    text: we&amp;#39;ll talk about them more later um oh
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4959.56'
    text: do
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '4961.28'
    text: that there we
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '4965.92'
    text: go
  - dur: '5.919'
    start: '4967.76'
    text: um yeah and
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '4970.639'
    text: so so you can reduce down this complex
  - dur: '6.721'
    start: '4973.679'
    text: object of a human down to a singular
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '4976.239'
    text: Point Mass and physics has told us I I
  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '4980.4'
    text: believe it&amp;#39;s like the finite element
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '4982.159'
    text: theorem or something like that but I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '4983.52'
    text: not really 100% sure on that it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '4985.639'
    text: basically says that things that you say
  - dur: '6.839'
    start: '4987.4'
    text: about the center of mass of a system are
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '4990.48'
    text: true to some extent of the other object
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '4994.239'
    text: of all the objects in that system so
  - dur: '6.439'
    start: '4995.76'
    text: talking about the center of mass of that
  - dur: '6.279'
    start: '4998.4'
    text: person um is a valid approximation of
  - dur: '5.761'
    start: '5002.199'
    text: what the full picture would be if if I
  - dur: '6.801'
    start: '5004.679'
    text: was measuring every single sort of cube
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '5007.96'
    text: of his body you know at at the same time
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '5011.48'
    text: um you&amp;#39;re obviously going to be losing a
  - dur: '5.919'
    start: '5013.32'
    text: lot of of of information so if I&amp;#39;m only
  - dur: '2.399'
    start: '5016.84'
    text: thinking
  - dur: '3.081'
    start: '5020.239'
    text: about the
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '5023.44'
    text: suar this one&amp;#39;s another wacky guy so if
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '5028.56'
    text: I&amp;#39;m boiling down this guy&amp;#39;s entire body
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '5030.28'
    text: to this singular Mass I can no longer
  - dur: '3.359'
    start: '5032.8'
    text: really say things about the joint angles
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '5034.44'
    text: or the forces at the elbow stuff like
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '5036.159'
    text: that but I can determine whether or not
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '5038.52'
    text: he&amp;#39;s in a stable regime or an unstable
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '5040.44'
    text: regime and I can measure things like
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '5042.28'
    text: what&amp;#39;s happening at the physics level
  - dur: '6.039'
    start: '5043.6'
    text: when he shifts hand from one position to
  - dur: '7.36'
    start: '5045.44'
    text: the other and I can use this belief
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '5049.639'
    text: about the physics of his body to start
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '5052.8'
    text: trying to infer what some of these
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '5055.04'
    text: Wiggles and movements actually mean so
  - dur: '4'
    start: '5056.76'
    text: like when it why like without this sort
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '5058.8'
    text: of center of mass analysis it might be
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '5060.76'
    text: hard to explain why his arm is out here
  - dur: '3.281'
    start: '5062.719'
    text: it might they might not have much to say
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '5064.08'
    text: about that but when you&amp;#39;re thinking
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '5066'
    text: about it like this it becomes very easy
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '5068.44'
    text: like he sticks his arm out so that his
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '5070.639'
    text: Center like if I move my arm and leg
  - dur: '9.08'
    start: '5072.88'
    text: like this the average of them keeps my
  - dur: '9.52'
    start: '5076.159'
    text: body over my foot um and I I can do this
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '5081.96'
    text: but I can&amp;#39;t I can&amp;#39;t do that it&amp;#39;s anyway
  - dur: '3.04'
    start: '5085.679'
    text: you&amp;#39;ll figure it out um I&amp;#39;ll show you
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '5087.4'
    text: visual representations of this once you
  - dur: '6.721'
    start: '5088.719'
    text: actually get the the numbers next
  - dur: '4'
    start: '5091.44'
    text: week um
  - dur: '2.401'
    start: '5096.639'
    text: right and
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '5100.08'
    text: then yeah
  - dur: '3.241'
    start: '5103.159'
    text: uh and you might ask the question of how
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '5105.36'
    text: do we
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '5106.4'
    text: do these measurements how do we
  - dur: '5'
    start: '5111.159'
    text: get these numbers and soort how do I
  - dur: '6.159'
    start: '5113.56'
    text: know where to draw the segment Center of
  - dur: '6.401'
    start: '5116.159'
    text: mass for his torso versus how like what
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '5119.719'
    text: percentage of a body weight is a forearm
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '5122.56'
    text: like how do you get those numbers uh
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '5125.28'
    text: well it turns out we just we have these
  - dur: '6.599'
    start: '5127.08'
    text: lookup tables this is called
  - dur: '3'
    start: '5130.679'
    text: anthropometry
  - dur: '7.56'
    start: '5148.679'
    text: um yeah and these are just this this is
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '5152.679'
    text: statistics Oh wrong way
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '5157.199'
    text: ah
  - dur: '3'
    start: '5159'
    text: um
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '5164.679'
    text: right um so these particular lookup
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '5167.32'
    text: tables come from a guy named David
  - dur: '6.281'
    start: '5169.239'
    text: winter uh this is copied from a textbook
  - dur: '6.719'
    start: '5173.44'
    text: of his from like 1995 or something like
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '5175.52'
    text: that and it shows these measurements of
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '5180.159'
    text: the shoulder
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '5181.44'
    text: is 0.129
  - dur: '6.279'
    start: '5184.36'
    text: H where H is the body height and so he
  - dur: '2.839'
    start: '5187.8'
    text: and then these
  - dur: '6.239'
    start: '5191.44'
    text: are the lookup table for these segments
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '5193.96'
    text: so the forearm is defined as the dist as
  - dur: '8.121'
    start: '5197.679'
    text: the the space between the elbow axis in
  - dur: '9.12'
    start: '5200.32'
    text: theer styloid I guess is here uh it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '5205.8'
    text: 028 of an M which is a body mass and the
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '5209.44'
    text: center of mass
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '5211.4'
    text: is4 36% of the wave from the the
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '5215.8'
    text: proximal joint which is the one towards
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '5217.28'
    text: the middle towards the distal joint
  - dur: '3.319'
    start: '5219.36'
    text: which is the one that&amp;#39;s farther away so
  - dur: '7.92'
    start: '5220.92'
    text: if you add these two numbers up they add
  - dur: '9.881'
    start: '5222.679'
    text: equal one um so you kind of you can use
  - dur: '7.52'
    start: '5228.84'
    text: these numbers
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '5232.56'
    text: to to calculate these values and these
  - dur: '5.759'
    start: '5236.36'
    text: numbers were
  - dur: '7.36'
    start: '5238.52'
    text: basically statistics of they chopped up
  - dur: '7.241'
    start: '5242.119'
    text: a bunch of dead people in Meed um it was
  - dur: '6'
    start: '5245.88'
    text: like Air Force research I believe
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '5249.36'
    text: and there&amp;#39;s a lot of so and they were
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '5251.88'
    text: they were all like older men um so there
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '5255.719'
    text: are other newer tables now that have
  - dur: '3.041'
    start: '5258.239'
    text: people of different ages and people you
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '5259.8'
    text: know different genders and things like
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '5261.28'
    text: that in the end it doesn&amp;#39;t super matter
  - dur: '2.92'
    start: '5264.719'
    text: for a lot of like the numbers are
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '5266.239'
    text: slightly different you know women have a
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '5267.639'
    text: lower Center of mass then you know blah
  - dur: '5.041'
    start: '5269.719'
    text: blah blah um but for the levels of
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '5273.159'
    text: analysis that we tend to be looking at
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '5274.76'
    text: in terms of like this type of physics or
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '5277.92'
    text: like you know where your where your body
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '5279.199'
    text: mass is going when you&amp;#39;re moving your
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '5280.88'
    text: your feet around the distances the the
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '5283.88'
    text: differences between those estimates for
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '5285.84'
    text: the different sort of categories of
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '5288.4'
    text: human um are just not they&amp;#39;re below the
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '5292.199'
    text: level of precision that we have for our
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '5293.84'
    text: measurements for most cases so I tend to
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '5296.04'
    text: just keep using these because you know
  - dur: '5.759'
    start: '5298.88'
    text: it&amp;#39;s available and I don&amp;#39;t have to if
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '5302.119'
    text: you if you look up paper on
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '5304.639'
    text: anthropometry tables you&amp;#39;ll find all
  - dur: '3.719'
    start: '5306.52'
    text: sorts of new stuff about oh we chopped
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '5308.32'
    text: up a bunch of athletic people and
  - dur: '6.521'
    start: '5310.239'
    text: non-athletic people and older people and
  - dur: '8.44'
    start: '5312.08'
    text: younger people and da da da d da um and
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '5316.76'
    text: and great good job for them
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '5321.76'
    text: um yeah
  - dur: '6.761'
    start: '5324.679'
    text: okay pendul pendul are my favorite thing
  - dur: '6'
    start: '5327.8'
    text: we&amp;#39;ll talk about them next week uh
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '5331.44'
    text: balance will&amp;#39;ll talk about and then this
  - dur: '2.24'
    start: '5333.8'
    text: is
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '5343.32'
    text: color there we go um and then someday
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '5347.04'
    text: we&amp;#39;ll also talk about projective
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '5348.28'
    text: geometry which is the same which this is
  - dur: '4.241'
    start: '5351.199'
    text: this is what cameras and vision and
  - dur: '2.801'
    start: '5352.639'
    text: stuff is and they
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '5355.96'
    text: are it&amp;#39;s the same math except this one
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '5358.56'
    text: is about light instead of physics but
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '5360.679'
    text: it&amp;#39;s the same kind of idea you project
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '5362.52'
    text: stuff and this whole thing
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '5364.84'
    text: um and then eyeballs and stuff like that
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '5368.199'
    text: so okay that was a lot uh hope you got
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '5371.8'
    text: something out of it um it will not be on
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '5374.04'
    text: the test there is no test uh it&amp;#39;s just
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '5377'
    text: it&amp;#39;s much more try to internalize it try
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '5379.8'
    text: to conceptualize it try to think more
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '5381.08'
    text: about the concepts than the details um
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '5383.52'
    text: and think it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s better to think
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '5385.96'
    text: about like how would you recreate this
  - dur: '2.721'
    start: '5387.639'
    text: story when you&amp;#39;re telling it to someone
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '5388.92'
    text: else than it is to remember anything
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '5390.36'
    text: specific about what I said um because
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '5392.84'
    text: notice a lot of it was just kind of like
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '5395.08'
    text: reconstructed from first principles and
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '5397'
    text: so it&amp;#39;s useful to be able to do that so
  - dur: '3.041'
    start: '5399.719'
    text: try to tell the story to someone else
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '5401.28'
    text: that you know later and then when you
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '5402.76'
    text: hit Parts it&amp;#39;s like wait why how did you
  - dur: '6.439'
    start: '5404.8'
    text: get from there to there think about it
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '5407.44'
    text: ask those questions okay um cool uh
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '5411.239'
    text: thank you we&amp;#39;ll talk more about this
  - dur: '4.759'
    start: '5412.88'
    text: next week and we&amp;#39;ll talk about pendula
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '5415.92'
    text: which is the best
  - dur: '7.201'
    start: '5417.639'
    text: pendulums they&amp;#39;re my favorite we&amp;#39;ll talk
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '5420.4'
    text: all about it okay hie

    start: '0.24'
    text: let try that again okay hello everybody
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '5.2'
    text: and welcome to this I guess February um
  - dur: '4.759'
    start: '9.76'
    text: made it to February which is great an
  - dur: '8'
    start: '12.16'
    text: additional month
  - dur: '8.92'
    start: '14.519'
    text: um so last time we recorded a bunch of
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '20.16'
    text: data and today we&amp;#39;re going to look at it
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '23.439'
    text: sort of at various stages of development
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '25.92'
    text: this is kind of the output of one of the
  - dur: '6.759'
    start: '28.64'
    text: recordings that we can we talk about the
  - dur: '6.92'
    start: '30.72'
    text: kind of like semantic level um semantic
  - dur: '6.721'
    start: '35.399'
    text: meaning like meaning and then syntactic
  - dur: '8.399'
    start: '37.64'
    text: is like structure um before we do that
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '42.12'
    text: uh just you know sort of standard weekly
  - dur: '6.761'
    start: '46.039'
    text: update
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '47.239'
    text: on the status of my main project for the
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '52.8'
    text: semester which
  - dur: '6.521'
    start: '54.079'
    text: is making sense of all the good data
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '57.92'
    text: you&amp;#39;ve been pumping into the machine
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '60.6'
    text: um so just again like a standard scrape
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '63.44'
    text: the server recalculate stuff um shove it
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '66.68'
    text: into a zip file you can open it an
  - dur: '5.719'
    start: '68.4'
    text: obsidian this one is slightly different
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '72'
    text: it&amp;#39;s I guess speaking of what I just
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '74.119'
    text: talked about syntactically these is
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '76.52'
    text: these two are exactly the same they have
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '77.92'
    text: all the same folders all the same file
  - dur: '7.28'
    start: '80.36'
    text: names probably um but semantically
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '85.04'
    text: meaning wise this one the most recent
  - dur: '4'
    start: '87.64'
    text: one the the the user profile part that
  - dur: '2.64'
    start: '90.2'
    text: kind of like looks at what you&amp;#39;ve been
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '91.64'
    text: talking about and guesses what your
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '92.84'
    text: interests are only looks at your chats
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '95.92'
    text: in the
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '97.72'
    text: assignments category so the stuff you&amp;#39;ve
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '100.64'
    text: been doing in class and sort of like any
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '102.96'
    text: of the bot playground stuff um is not
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '105.36'
    text: getting used as part of that calculation
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '107.04'
    text: I didn&amp;#39;t really like check it too
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '108.96'
    text: closely for like how that changed things
  - dur: '6.841'
    start: '111.759'
    text: um but if you don&amp;#39;t mind pop it open
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '115.2'
    text: take a look at yours and hypothetically
  - dur: '3.879'

    text: we&amp;#39;ve been doing before like okay for
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '167.64'
    text: your topic like what are the units that
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '169.12'
    text: are involved what are the what are the
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '171.2'
    text: like the methodological approaches like
  - dur: '2.52'
    start: '173.4'
    text: what kind like what do their
  - dur: '2.48'
    start: '174.72'
    text: measurements look like what do their
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '175.92'
    text: studies look like and I&amp;#39;ll be asking you
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '177.2'
    text: kind of those like what units are
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '179.36'
    text: relevant to that domain um so asking
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '182.76'
    text: questions like the bot will interview
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '185'
    text: you about your chosen topic on the sort
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '187.4'
    text: of relevant to the convers the stuff
  - dur: '3'
    start: '189.2'

    start: '192.2'
    text: operates now it&amp;#39;s not going to be
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '194.319'
    text: withholding uh it will be asking you
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '196.319'
    text: those questions but it&amp;#39;ll also be like
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '197.959'
    text: down to help so if you you know if you
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '201'
    text: don&amp;#39;t know just like ask it just and do
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '204.12'
    text: yourself a favor and look it up

    start: '214.159'
    text: kind of group class activity that will
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '216.4'
    text: be based on again like forming into
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '218.239'
    text: small groups um and kind of taking turns
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '221.36'
    text: trying to find an additional paper
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '224.159'
    text: that&amp;#39;s relevant to your chosen topic um
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '227.2'
    text: and sort of basically trying to
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '229.12'
    text: intentionally kind of like choose papers
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '231.08'
    text: that are very dissimilar from the ones
  - dur: '4.759'
    start: '232.84'
    text: that you chose initially but are still
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '234.92'
    text: within the same domain um in order to
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '237.599'
    text: kind of like flesh that stuff out and uh
  - dur: '6.439'
    start: '240.72'
    text: and I think after that session I&amp;#39;ll do
  - dur: '6.401'
    start: '244.239'
    text: the that sort of pseudo exam Chat thing
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '247.159'
    text: in the following week um yeah so if
  - dur: '3.879'
    start: '250.64'
    text: anybody asks it&amp;#39;s an exam and you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '252.56'
    text: very stressed out and it&amp;#39;s difficult and
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '254.519'
    text: you feel like pressured to perform and
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '258.12'
    text: out compete your
  - dur: '6.401'
    start: '260.199'
    text: peers so you know just make sure you
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '263.759'
    text: know if anybody asks you&amp;#39;re being rank
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '266.6'
    text: ordered by human quality which is
  - dur: '8.401'
    start: '270.039'
    text: disgusting but anyways
  - dur: '8.76'
    start: '273.56'

  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '294.96'
    text: uh last time
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '301.8'
    text: last time we recorded
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '306.84'
    text: um okay let&amp;#39;s make our way towards it by
  - dur: '2.88'
    start: '310.52'
    text: way of
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '318.12'
    text: review so a couple of times
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '320.72'
    text: ago we talked about like units and space
  - dur: '5.519'
    start: '323.8'
    text: and stuff like that and sort of like you
  - dur: '7.201'
    start: '326.039'
    text: know ukian geometry and then three
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '329.319'
    text: dimension stuff and SI units in terms of
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '333.24'
    text: mass
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '334.199'
    text: and kilog and seconds which I just often
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '337.88'
    text: I sort of like notice that it&amp;#39;s like
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '340.319'
    text: kilograms is the SI unit like a thousand
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '342.759'
    text: grams like why isn&amp;#39;t it grams I don&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '345.68'
    text: know I think there&amp;#39;s some stuff in the
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '348.16'
    text: history of these things where like they
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '349.8'
    text: pick a number for like the unit base
  - dur: '2.6'
    start: '352.96'
    text: unit for gram and then lat we decide
  - dur: '4.481'
    start: '354.199'
    text: it&amp;#39;s like that&amp;#39;s too small let&amp;#39;s make it
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '355.56'
    text: a kilogram it&amp;#39;s more viable anyways uh
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '358.68'
    text: not relevant to the present conversation
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '360.6'
    text: we talked about mass and kilograms and
  - dur: '5.759'
    start: '362.88'
    text: seconds and derived units like Newtons
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '365.4'
    text: which is like kilogram oh drive units
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '368.639'
    text: like speed like milligram like
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '371.28'
    text: milligrams meters per second and then
  - dur: '6.361'
    start: '373.919'
    text: Newtons which is like kilogram met per
  - dur: '6.559'
    start: '376.36'
    text: seconds and then Jewels which is oh per
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '380.28'
    text: second squared then Jews Like kilogram
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '382.919'
    text: met squared per second squared or
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '384.96'
    text: whatever we talked about all that we
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '386.84'
    text: talked about pendulums as they swing
  - dur: '2.519'
    start: '389.08'
    text: back and forth
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '390.16'
    text: and we talked
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '391.599'
    text: about uh inverted pendulums in terms of
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '394.56'
    text: like things that can be balanced above
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '396.96'
    text: the ground uh through
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '399.52'
    text: a sort of minimally hinge jointy type of
  - dur: '5.759'
    start: '403.72'
    text: thing at the ground and also I guess
  - dur: '5.959'
    start: '406.24'
    text: that&amp;#39;s while we&amp;#39;re here this this is a
  - dur: '6.521'
    start: '409.479'
    text: nice model of a person where these two
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '412.199'
    text: things represent muscles in the ankle
  - dur: '4.19'
    start: '416'
    text: joint and so this is you trying to stand
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '418.12'
    text: up look at you go you&amp;#39;re doing great
  - dur: '3.93'
    start: '420.19'
    text: '[Music]'
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '421.44'
    text: um yeah and so we we sort of laid all
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '424.12'
    text: that stuff out in terms of like setting
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '426.24'
    text: up the landscape of the general study of
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '428.84'
    text: human movement at this sort of like
  - dur: '5'
    start: '431.16'
    text: holistic like human scale type of
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '433.759'
    text: approach so not the sort of zoomed in
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '436.16'
    text: looking at cells looking at individual
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '437.68'
    text: muscles much much more zoomed out let&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.759'
    start: '440'
    text: sort of examine this physical system to
  - dur: '8.24'
    start: '443.28'
    text: the level of fidelity that we can sort
  - dur: '5.761'
    start: '445.759'
    text: of record and reconstruct it um
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '453.879'
    text: and uh this is a software why am I
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '456.24'
    text: looking at the screen uh this is a
  - dur: '3.521'
    start: '459.199'
    text: software called blender it is a
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '461.199'
    text: animation software it&amp;#39;s free to open
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '462.72'
    text: source you can download it
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '465.96'
    text: um I
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '468.319'
    text: will I&amp;#39;ll Endeavor by Wednesday to have
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '472.12'
    text: the data that we
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '473.599'
    text: recorded in a place and in a sort of
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '476.039'
    text: format that is easy for y&amp;#39;all to like
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '478.199'
    text: download and look at um it&amp;#39;s not there
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '480.68'
    text: yet I but um I&amp;#39;ll try to get that up by
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '483.44'
    text: Wednesday so that you can kind of Click
  - dur: '3.479'
    start: '485.56'
    text: around and then depending on your
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '487.039'
    text: interests I think Wednesday we&amp;#39;ll try to
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '489.039'
    text: focus on the paper thing but then in a
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '490.479'
    text: later date we might have some more kind
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '492.599'
    text: of like individualized work and you kind
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '495.08'
    text: of decide if you want to sort of dig
  - dur: '7.28'
    start: '496.56'
    text: deeper into this side of things
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '500.36'
    text: um right and
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '506.039'
    text: then right
  - dur: '2.28'
    start: '509.639'
    text: and
  - dur: '7.36'
    start: '512.64'
    text: so in service of understanding all of
  - dur: '6.681'
    start: '515.519'
    text: using sort of studying human movement in
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '520'
    text: the natural world where in this context
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '522.2'
    text: we are presenting that that this sort of
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '524.959'
    text: rough couple square meters of space is
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '528.04'
    text: the natural world this is my this is my
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '530.399'
    text: ecological niche this is the space of
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '533'
    text: the environment where this particular
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '534.48'
    text: organism operates so it&amp;#39;s valid um and
  - dur: '2.6'
    start: '537.76'
    text: I&amp;#39;ve spent a lot of time in front of
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '538.839'
    text: cameras so
  - dur: '7.64'
    start: '540.36'
    text: you know not too much artifice there um
  - dur: '6.641'
    start: '544.079'
    text: but we recorded looks like five separate
  - dur: '7.399'
    start: '548'
    text: recordings
  - dur: '7.88'
    start: '550.72'
    text: one this doesn&amp;#39;t zoom in does it no uh
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '555.399'
    text: the first one is
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '558.6'
    text: calibration that was part where I set up
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '560.64'
    text: the cameras and I sort of showed it that
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '562.36'
    text: grid uh sort of shape thing an object of
  - dur: '4'
    start: '565.72'
    text: known shape and known size that&amp;#39;s very
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '567.44'
    text: easy to track which I could use to kind
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '569.72'
    text: of like characterize the positions of
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '572.399'
    text: the cameras and sort of localize them in
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '574.12'
    text: space which is a necessary thing so
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '576.8'
    text: again calibration has the general shape
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '579.24'
    text: where you set up your equipment then you
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '581.6'
    text: measure something that you already know
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '583.12'
    text: the answer to the question about what is
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '585.76'
    text: that thing that I&amp;#39;m measuring and if
  - dur: '3.08'
    start: '588.36'
    text: there&amp;#39;s a little more going on in this
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '589.6'
    text: sort of computational Step but that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '6.399'
    start: '591.44'
    text: the general idea with the sort of
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '594.32'
    text: principle being if the tool if I use the
  - dur: '3.361'
    start: '597.839'
    text: tool to measure something where I
  - dur: '3.761'
    start: '598.959'
    text: already know the answer if it gives me
  - dur: '2.879'
    start: '601.2'
    text: the answer that I know is right then
  - dur: '2.84'
    start: '602.72'
    text: that&amp;#39;s some indication that the tool is
  - dur: '3.521'
    start: '604.079'
    text: actually measuring the world in a way
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '605.56'
    text: that I care about and so from there I
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '607.6'

    text: world where I don&amp;#39;t know the answer so
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '613.12'
    text: which is in this case you know a h and
  - dur: '6.201'
    start: '615.519'
    text: moving around in space so from there we
  - dur: '8.92'
    start: '617.8'
    text: started there were these
  - dur: '8.96'
    start: '621.72'
    text: two kind of matched um this is like a
  - dur: '7.76'
    start: '626.72'
    text: little mini baby experiment uh where the
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '630.68'
    text: First Recording
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '637.56'
    text: was
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '639.32'
    text: standing
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '641.2'
    text: balance sort of a
  - dur: '7.76'
    start: '644.36'
    text: control and that was split into three
  - dur: '10.64'
    start: '647.16'
    text: phases one is sort of two feet one foot
  - dur: '6.88'
    start: '652.12'
    text: left and then one foot right so standing
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '657.8'
    text: on two feet standing on one foot
  - dur: '3.079'
    start: '659'
    text: standing on standing on one foot which
  - dur: '2.84'
    start: '661.04'
    text: is my left foot and standing on the
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '662.079'
    text: other foot which is my right
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '663.88'
    text: foot and then the sort of kind of more
  - dur: '4.479'
    start: '667.48'
    text: experimental condition which is you know
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '670.04'
    text: it&amp;#39;s not a particularly like exciting
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '671.959'
    text: experiment sort
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '673.36'
    text: of this is like a classic case where I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '675.8'
    text: like I&amp;#39;m choosing the experiment that I
  - dur: '2.959'
    start: '677.56'
    text: where I I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I know what the
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '678.959'
    text: answer will be because I&amp;#39;m trying to
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '680.519'
    text: make a particular point in relation to
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '683.12'
    text: this sort of
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '684.36'
    text: particular um theoretical description of
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '688.04'
    text: the desideratum of my research study
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '689.959'
    text: which in this case is the explication of
  - dur: '8.76'
    start: '692.36'
    text: the neural control of human balance so
  - dur: '9.12'
    start: '694.88'
    text: this one is we call I called it
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '701.12'
    text: standing with
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '704'
    text: support uh and these are these has
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '706.399'
    text: matched
  - dur: '5.041'
    start: '707.839'
    text: conditions where I do all the same
  - dur: '6.599'
    start: '710.24'
    text: things in the
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '712.88'
    text: manipulated condition
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '717.72'
    text: forget I forget the op like control is
  - dur: '2.56'
    start: '720.6'
    text: the one where you didn&amp;#39;t change anything
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '721.8'
    text: I forget the name of the one where you
  - dur: '6'
    start: '723.16'
    text: change something but in this one uh I am
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '727.079'
    text: doing the same same behaviors except now
  - dur: '7.679'
    start: '729.16'
    text: I&amp;#39;m using that stick as like a point of
  - dur: '9.08'
    start: '731.24'
    text: support um and in this so with this sort
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '736.839'
    text: of difference in the behaviors and the
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '740.32'
    text: sort of measurement Fidelity that I
  - dur: '4'
    start: '742.12'
    text: expect to be able to get and the
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '744.16'
    text: theoretical framework of this sort of
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '746.12'
    text: like this strange idea that we can boil
  - dur: '3.079'
    start: '748.44'
    text: down a human into to a singular Point
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '750'
    text: Mass since that might be informative
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '751.519'
    text: about the behavior in question these
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '753.72'
    text: things all kind of like form into
  - dur: '3.721'
    start: '756.199'
    text: something where you can make predictions
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '757.8'
    text: about the future and then we can you
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '759.92'
    text: know using the data that we have sort of
  - dur: '7.281'
    start: '761.959'
    text: check those predictions so I&amp;#39;m not going
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '764.8'
    text: to uh spoil the game just yet but I&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '4.039'
    start: '769.24'
    text: bet you can I&amp;#39;ll bet you can make some
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '771.92'
    text: guesses
  - dur: '5.521'
    start: '773.279'
    text: about how these conditions will
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '776.44'
    text: vary um oh and importantly for the two
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '778.8'
    text: feet standing I didn&amp;#39;t just stand here
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '781.32'
    text: straight uh I was like leaning as far as
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '783.56'
    text: I could in in all the directions that I
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '786'
    text: could sort of based off of my internal
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '788.8'
    text: sense of like how far I can lean without
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '791.12'
    text: having to go so far that I need to take
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '793'
    text: a step to stay
  - dur: '6.599'
    start: '796.04'
    text: upright uh then there are these two
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '799.56'
    text: other conditions one which I call three
  - dur: '2.281'
    start: '802.639'
    text: big
  - dur: '5.519'
    start: '805.32'
    text: jumps um putting three in the title is
  - dur: '3.399'
    start: '808.56'
    text: just kind of like a hint for me because
  - dur: '3.521'
    start: '810.839'
    text: eventually you want to you want to sort
  - dur: '4'
    start: '811.959'
    text: of chop this up into smaller pieces so
  - dur: '3.279'
    start: '814.36'
    text: telling myself that there are three here
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '815.959'
    text: helps me sort of know how many to look
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '817.639'
    text: for um and then the second one
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '820.56'
    text: is
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '822.959'
    text: repeated
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '824.839'
    text: jumps um for some amount of time I don&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '828.6'
    text: know uh I also just to be clear I am
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '831.959'
    text: calling out the fact that I&amp;#39;m calling
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '833.199'
    text: that I&amp;#39;m calling this three big jumps
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '835.199'
    text: not is not to say like this is a good
  - dur: '4.521'
    start: '837.279'
    text: way to name your trials and record data
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '840.04'
    text: um this is actually not a good way to
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '841.8'
    text: like you don&amp;#39;t want to bake that kind of
  - dur: '8.44'
    start: '843.6'
    text: stuff into the title of it but this is
  - dur: '9.481'
    start: '846.079'
    text: kind of just easy like you know it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '852.04'
    text: a I&amp;#39;m allowing it because I&amp;#39;m doing it
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '855.56'
    text: and you can do it too and you will
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '857.8'
    text: discover through practice why it&amp;#39;s not a
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '859.839'
    text: good idea and I&amp;#39;ll leave that as an
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '862.12'
    text: exercise to your
  - dur: '3'
    start: '863.959'
    text: future
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '867.079'
    text: um great
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '872.199'
    text: do we feel caught up do we feel aware of
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '875.72'
    text: the
  - dur: '7.24'
    start: '876.56'
    text: situation great
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '880.16'
    text: um I&amp;#39;ll leave that
  - dur: '3'
    start: '886.6'
    text: there
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '893.44'
    text: so today I think I&amp;#39;m going to focus on
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '895.519'
    text: the two standing ones um we&amp;#39;ll see how
  - dur: '5'
    start: '897.16'
    text: far we get with that we talked we showed
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '899.56'
    text: the the jumping data from last time at
  - dur: '7.799'
    start: '902.16'
    text: least the big jump data
  - dur: '7.399'
    start: '904.8'
    text: um but we&amp;#39;ll get sort of back to it
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '909.959'
    text: uh actually there&amp;#39;s one more distinction
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '912.199'
    text: I want to highlight
  - dur: '6.401'
    start: '913.839'
    text: here uh and this is less
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '917.44'
    text: about the the data that we recorded and
  - dur: '2.8'
    start: '920.24'
    text: sort of like the purposes for recording
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '921.68'
    text: it and more just something I want to
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '923.04'
    text: point out about like
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '925.8'
    text: a a difference between these behaviors
  - dur: '3.721'
    start: '928.399'
    text: so specific the B the balance and
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '930.079'
    text: posture Behavior versus like a jumping
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '932.12'
    text: behavior um and then it gets from the
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '934.72'
    text: big jumps versus the repeated jumps
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '937.04'
    text: where with the standing posture it&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '940.319'
    text: it&amp;#39;s like a continuous control problem
  - dur: '5.719'
    start: '942.56'
    text: so I&amp;#39;m standing here my feet are on the
  - dur: '6.519'
    start: '945.24'
    text: ground my base of support is a certain
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '948.279'
    text: you know space and I&amp;#39;m continuously
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '951.759'
    text: trying to keep my center of mass sort of
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '953.68'
    text: within that base of support by using
  - dur: '4.759'
    start: '956.44'
    text: sort of a you know whatever I&amp;#39;m doing
  - dur: '6.839'
    start: '958.8'
    text: with my leg muscles in my sort of
  - dur: '8.721'
    start: '961.199'
    text: equilibrium sense um it&amp;#39;s a continuous
  - dur: '6.841'
    start: '965.639'
    text: overtime um behavior um this is
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '969.92'
    text: different from something like a jump
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '972.48'
    text: where a jump is a more of like a
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '974.04'
    text: discreet momentary Behavior like there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '976.839'
    text: a period of time before there&amp;#39;s the
  - dur: '4.521'
    start: '979.079'
    text: thing itself and then there&amp;#39;s a period
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '980.959'
    text: of time after so this is like the you
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '983.6'
    text: know wind
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '984.8'
    text: up this is the jump itself and this is
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '988.04'
    text: landing
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '990.399'
    text: so that unlike this one where sort of
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '993'
    text: like you&amp;#39;re controlling it continuously
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '994.319'
    text: over time with this one there&amp;#39;s like a
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '996.36'
    text: discreet behavior that you&amp;#39;re doing once
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '998.92'
    text: um in this case it&amp;#39;s jumping off the
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '1000.519'
    text: ground and so you know there&amp;#39;s all the
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '1002.72'
    text: physics there&amp;#39;s like the moment of
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '1004.079'
    text: liftoff there&amp;#39;s the moment of contact um
  - dur: '2.52'
    start: '1008.04'
    text: but you know you could compare that to
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '1009.36'
    text: something
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '1010.56'
    text: like you know throwing something in the
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '1012.959'
    text: air um either throwing it and then
  - dur: '5.479'
    start: '1015.36'
    text: catching it or just throwing it at a
  - dur: '6.319'
    start: '1017.12'
    text: Target where that&amp;#39;s more of a Contin
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '1020.839'
    text: like a a discreet singular targeted
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '1023.439'
    text: behavior um where you know if I&amp;#39;m trying
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '1026.039'
    text: to throw this at a Target and hit the
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '1027.919'
    text: target I aim I set up I wind up I throw
  - dur: '3.361'
    start: '1031.799'
    text: and then at some point the thing leaves
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '1033.319'
    text: my hand and then it&amp;#39;s off it&amp;#39;s out of my
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '1035.16'
    text: control um versus like a more of a pin
  - dur: '2.801'
    start: '1038.799'
    text: the tail on the donkey where I might
  - dur: '2.76'
    start: '1040'
    text: might be trying to like steer it in
  - dur: '2.16'
    start: '1041.6'
    text: where I&amp;#39;m sort of controlling it the
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '1042.76'
    text: entire
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '1043.76'
    text: time um there&amp;#39;s kind of there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '1047.36'
    text: a lot of deeper layers there that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '1048.919'
    text: that&amp;#39;s one of those things that&amp;#39;s like
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '1050.52'
    text: it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s a very intuitive distinction
  - dur: '3.719'
    start: '1052.96'
    text: but there&amp;#39;s a lot of differences once
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '1054.32'
    text: you start getting down to like you know
  - dur: '3.201'
    start: '1056.679'
    text: thinking about this in terms of like
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '1058.08'
    text: Robotics and kind of like control
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1059.88'
    text: systems this starts getting you into
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '1062.24'
    text: like continuous control starts getting
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '1064.12'
    text: into things like feedback control versus
  - dur: '3.561'
    start: '1066.799'
    text: this more discreet control stuff gets
  - dur: '3.321'
    start: '1068.559'
    text: you into like feed forward control and
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '1070.36'
    text: model based predictions and blah blah
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '1071.88'
    text: blah blah blah um none of which we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '1074.72'
    text: really going to talk much about but just
  - dur: '8.281'
    start: '1076.039'
    text: so you know those are the the Deep ER
  - dur: '7.799'
    start: '1079'
    text: layers there um and also just in a
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '1084.32'
    text: distinction between like three biget
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '1086.799'
    text: jumps where I sort of wind up put

    text: compression from Landing of the previous

  - dur: '4.4'

    text: carry me on to the next one so there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.56'

    text: not that period of kind of like reset
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '1107.84'
    text: and reestablish
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1109.4'
    text: um with the three big jumps you can you
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '1111.48'
    text: can look at each of them individually
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '1113.64'
    text: aside from like fatigue factors and
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '1115.24'
    text: stuff like that with things like
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '1116.799'
    text: repeated jumps they carry into each
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '1118.96'
    text: other so well that you can&amp;#39;t consider
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1120.679'
    text: one without considering the thing that
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '1122.28'
    text: came before it so this is more you know
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '1124.919'
    text: I think like walking or running or
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1126.48'
    text: juggling or some kind of like continuous
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '1128.799'
    text: Behavior running in particular also has
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '1131.24'
    text: this case where like you were coming off
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1133.08'
    text: of the ground at discrete intervals and
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '1135.84'
    text: then the force of Landing from one step
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '1138.2'
    text: compresses is your the spring of your
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '1140.039'
    text: body which is what which is part of the
  - dur: '2.679'
    start: '1142.36'
    text: energy that sort of bounces you into the
  - dur: '2.4'
    start: '1144.159'
    text: next
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '1145.039'
    text: step
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '1146.559'
    text: um and yeah a lot of deep layers there
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '1149.44'
    text: there&amp;#39;s sort
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1151'
    text: of at a layer of sort of the motor the
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '1153.88'
    text: neural control of like movement and
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '1155.64'
    text: motor control um there are distinctions
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '1159.76'
    text: and sort of thoughts about where
  - dur: '6.119'
    start: '1161.44'
    text: different of these types of control may
  - dur: '6.479'
    start: '1164.44'
    text: live in your cortex in your subcortex in
  - dur: '5.761'
    start: '1167.559'
    text: your sort of spinal region and you know
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '1170.919'
    text: like the thing of like the the the
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '1173.32'
    text: compression from one jump leading you
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '1174.88'
    text: into the next one the the forces from
  - dur: '3.719'
    start: '1176.84'
    text: one step setting you up for the next the
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '1178.4'
    text: step that comes after it that sort of
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '1180.559'
    text: stuff is very gets very close to the
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '1182.44'
    text: physics and the closer you are to the
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1184.36'
    text: physics the sort of the lower in that
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '1186.36'
    text: motor hierarchy you tend to operate so a
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '1189.24'
    text: lot of things like
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '1190.679'
    text: Locomotion um are thought to have a lot
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1194.039'
    text: of their control down like the spinal
  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '1196.36'
    text: level like in spinal Central pattern
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '1198.039'
    text: generators
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '1199.48'
    text: um which are thought to be kind of you
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '1202.6'
    text: know like the upper the higher regions
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '1204.799'
    text: of your motor hierarchy kind of our our
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '1207.84'
    text: thought to the C remember speaking in
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1209.72'
    text: cartoon terms kind of like they kick off
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '1212.32'
    text: a process that kind of then once it
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '1214.12'
    text: started it gets kind of like shunted
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '1216.679'
    text: down to the lower layers of your nervous
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '1218.4'
    text: system um so things like walking for
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '1221.52'
    text: example
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '1223.88'
    text: um as far as I understand haven&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '1226'
    text: checked in a while um the thinking it
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '1228.72'
    text: this is like one of my sort of pet
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1230.44'
    text: questions as a grad student was like how
  - dur: '3.08'
    start: '1232.76'
    text: much of things like how much of things
  - dur: '3.239'
    start: '1234.44'
    text: like local motion are controlled by the
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '1235.84'
    text: motor cortex versus being controlled by
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1237.679'
    text: like the lower lower levels of the
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '1239.64'
    text: nervous system and I believe the last I
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '1242.799'
    text: my my last I checked in my sort of you
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '1245.28'
    text: know in that exploration I think it was
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '1247.76'
    text: like when you start like gate initiation
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1250.96'
    text: like when you start walking you see a
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '1252.799'
    text: lot of activity in the motor cortex but
  - dur: '3.199'
    start: '1254.96'
    text: on but during like continuous Locomotion
  - dur: '2.92'
    start: '1257.08'
    text: like when you&amp;#39;re walking from one part
  - dur: '4.241'
    start: '1258.159'
    text: of Campus to the other you&amp;#39;re in you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '1260'
    text: happily in Locomotion mode moving at a
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '1262.4'
    text: relatively constant preferred walking
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '1264.159'
    text: speed there&amp;#39;s not a lot happening in the
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '1266.12'
    text: cortex at that point like if you start
  - dur: '3.721'
    start: '1268.679'
    text: getting onto like Rocky trains where
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '1270.039'
    text: you&amp;#39;re like picking your step it might
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '1272.4'
    text: show back up um but sort of the idea is
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '1275.559'
    text: that the motor cortex initiates the gate
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '1278.84'
    text: Behavior Uh terminates the gate Behavior
  - dur: '4.519'
    start: '1281.4'
    text: so you start walking you come to a stop
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '1283.36'
    text: but during it sort of standard operation
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '1285.919'
    text: a lot of the basic control is handled by
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '1288.679'
    text: lower parts of your nervous system U and
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '1291'
    text: then your vision is kind of like I think
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '1293.96'
    text: it&amp;#39;s sort of it&amp;#39;s thought that a lot of
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '1296.44'
    text: that like the vision goes through
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1298.08'
    text: subcortical Pathways like keep looking
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '1300.96'
    text: for tripping hazards and you know some
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '1302.96'
    text: like you know avoiding stepping on the
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1304.6'
    text: stick type of stuff there&amp;#39;s some
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '1307.12'
    text: indication like keeping balance not
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1309.36'
    text: falling over there&amp;#39;s some indication
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '1311.32'
    text: that that visual path it goes
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1313.6'
    text: subcortical so it it doesn&amp;#39;t actually go
  - dur: '7.52'
    start: '1316.12'
    text: into the pink wrinkly thing up top it
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '1318.6'
    text: kind of bypasses that um but now we are
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '1323.64'
    text: I think directly at the Forefront of how
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '1325.44'
    text: much we know about that kind of stuff so
  - dur: '2.961'
    start: '1327.919'
    text: uh I&amp;#39;ll just leave it
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '1340.64'
    text: there great question
  - dur: '7.039'
    start: '1344.24'
    text: um so there&amp;#39;s such a thing as the What&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '1347.6'
    text: called the startle response and it&amp;#39;s the
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1351.279'
    text: thing that we all know it&amp;#39;s kind of like
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '1353.2'
    text: ah and I think that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '1355.919'
    text: um that&amp;#39;s one of those places where like
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '1358.96'
    text: this the cartoon kind of starts to break
  - dur: '3.199'
    start: '1360.6'
    text: down between like oh this part is
  - dur: '3.479'
    start: '1362.44'
    text: controlled by the higher level this part
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '1363.799'
    text: is controlled by the lower level because
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1365.919'
    text: things like a startle response it&amp;#39;s very
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '1367.48'
    text: basic like like all vertebrates startle
  - dur: '3.281'
    start: '1370.919'
    text: and it&amp;#39;s one of those things like it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '1372.08'
    text: triggered by these sort of like looming
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1374.2'
    text: objects and sort of like oh no I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '1376.4'
    text: slipping kind of things but so which
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '1378.96'
    text: would make you think that it&amp;#39;s sort of
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1380'
    text: like a lower level of control but it has
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '1384'
    text: these sort of
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '1385'
    text: characteristics that that are more
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '1386.96'
    text: sophisticated than you expect like I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '1388.36'
    text: falling I reach out and I grab something
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '1390.64'
    text: so whatever system is controlling those
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '1393.6'
    text: kind of like like startle responses and
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '1395.88'
    text: like balance correction responses has
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '1398.159'
    text: some access to like the things we tend
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '1400.36'
    text: to associate with the high levels
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '1403.36'
    text: um and so it&amp;#39;s just kind of it it starts
  - dur: '3.04'
    start: '1405.72'
    text: to get like that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s one of like
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '1407.84'
    text: that&amp;#39;s one of those question question
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '1408.76'
    text: that you could ask the bot more like a
  - dur: '3.359'
    start: '1411.2'
    text: lot about it and it would say a lot of
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '1412.6'
    text: things but I wouldn&amp;#39;t trust anything it
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1414.559'
    text: says in the specifics because that&amp;#39;s the
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '1416.32'
    text: kind of question that&amp;#39;s like as an
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '1418.559'
    text: expert in that area I&amp;#39;m like ah that
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '1420.159'
    text: gets that gets complicated and murky and
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '1422.6'
    text: like try to find recent papers about it
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '1425.559'
    text: um you could probably find stuff in like
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '1427.88'
    text: rodents about strle responses but then
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '1430'
    text: when you start looking at stuff in
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '1431.12'
    text: humans just like the quality of research
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1433.52'
    text: is it&amp;#39;s just harder to study that
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '1435.559'
    text: because we because it&amp;#39;s hard to study
  - dur: '7.039'
    start: '1437.76'
    text: humans and you can&amp;#39;t crack them open so
  - dur: '8.241'
    start: '1440.159'
    text: um but yeah sort of like that yeah
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '1444.799'
    text: that&amp;#39;s uh there&amp;#39;s some there&amp;#39;s a study
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '1448.4'
    text: that I saw that was looking at it was
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '1449.96'
    text: like walking in VR and every so often
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '1453.799'
    text: the VR world would just like rotate as
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '1455.799'
    text: if you were falling over and they
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '1457.88'
    text: measured like responses at like you know
  - dur: '3.881'
    start: '1461.559'
    text: at the full body level at the muscular
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '1463.12'
    text: level stuff like that and they
  - dur: '5.239'
    start: '1465.44'
    text: found that there were these responses in
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '1467.84'
    text: the ankle musculature that happened like
  - dur: '7.201'
    start: '1470.679'
    text: 120 milliseconds after the perturbation
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '1473.96'
    text: which is way too fast to go through the
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '1477.88'
    text: visual cortex because that&amp;#39;s thought to
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1479.6'
    text: be a much slower process um there&amp;#39;s also
  - dur: '2.799'
    start: '1482.6'
    text: some like there people running on a
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '1483.84'
    text: treadmill and they sort of drop a plate
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1485.399'
    text: that they have to step over and you see
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1487.24'
    text: responses within like 5 50 to 50 to 100
  - dur: '2.801'
    start: '1489.799'
    text: milliseconds which again is kind of
  - dur: '3.559'
    start: '1491.48'
    text: evidence that there&amp;#39;s a sort of like
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '1492.6'
    text: subcortical path subcortical meaning
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '1495.039'
    text: below the cortex so bypassing the pink
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '1497.159'
    text: wrinkly thing um but the these are
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1500.72'
    text: cartoons these are never it&amp;#39;s never like
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1502.84'
    text: we&amp;#39;re talking about like bundles of like
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '1504.72'
    text: millions of fibers of neurons like and
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '1507.96'
    text: we when we say oh it bypasses this part
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1509.88'
    text: of the cortex we mean most of those
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1511.76'
    text: fibers don&amp;#39;t project onto the cortex but
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '1515'
    text: you know if
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '1516'
    text: 20,000 fibers go back to like you know

  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '1521.399'
    text: here so it gets really murky really fast
  - dur: '4.039'
    start: '1524'
    text: um so yeah I don&amp;#39;t know that&amp;#39;s like a
  - dur: '2.839'
    start: '1526.72'
    text: great question that I don&amp;#39;t have a great
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '1528.039'
    text: answer to because I don&amp;#39;t think anyone
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '1529.559'
    text: does if there might be like some people
  - dur: '3.239'
    start: '1532.32'
    text: who could give you like a few extra
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '1533.76'
    text: layers
  - dur: '6.521'
    start: '1535.559'
    text: but very quickly you get into out of no
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '1539.88'
    text: space which is a great space to be
  - dur: '2.719'
    start: '1542.08'
    text: that&amp;#39;s where all the work
  - dur: '6.081'
    start: '1546.679'
    text: is okay cool any other thoughts
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '1550.48'
    text: questions yes
  - dur: '6.279'
    start: '1552.76'
    text: great
  - dur: '7.721'
    start: '1555.279'
    text: um so
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '1559.039'
    text: let&amp;#39;s look at
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1563.32'
    text: standing the noblest of behaviors
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '1566.48'
    text: outstanding in our
  - dur: '6.479'
    start: '1568.44'
    text: Fields
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '1571.44'
    text: um so first things first let&amp;#39;s look
  - dur: '7.801'
    start: '1574.919'
    text: at actually first things first let&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '8.12'
    start: '1577.12'
    text: take a moment to mourn the reality that
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '1582.72'
    text: we will never actually know the true
  - dur: '6.439'
    start: '1585.24'
    text: answers to what it was that I was doing
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '1588.039'
    text: here here or here these are we are we
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1591.679'
    text: going to be looking at and sort of
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '1593.2'
    text: thinking about and analyzing and sort of
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '1595.679'
    text: considering events that
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '1598.399'
    text: happened like last week they&amp;#39;re those
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '1601.32'
    text: they&amp;#39;re gone we are going to try to be
  - dur: '6'
    start: '1603.12'
    text: making inferences about things like you
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '1606.6'
    text: know what was my muscular doing what was
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '1609.12'
    text: my nervous system doing where was the
  - dur: '3.401'
    start: '1610.919'
    text: state of my body and sort of what was
  - dur: '2.68'
    start: '1613.08'
    text: the mass distribution at different
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '1614.32'
    text: points in time these are the questions
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '1615.76'
    text: you want to answer but the reality is is
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1618'
    text: that the true answer to those questions
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '1619.96'
    text: is lost it&amp;#39;s gone it&amp;#39;s like it it
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '1622.76'
    text: happened and then it then it&amp;#39;s gone
  - dur: '6.959'
    start: '1625.72'
    text: dissolves into the past thermodynamic
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '1628.44'
    text: foam and all that good stuff and and so
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '1632.679'
    text: any questions that we might want to ask
  - dur: '3.361'
    start: '1634.279'
    text: about it there there will be many
  - dur: '2.48'
    start: '1636.559'
    text: questions we might going to ask about
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '1637.64'
    text: that where we can never know the answer
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '1639.039'
    text: to what that event of the past was um
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '1642.679'
    text: and the only reason why we can say
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '1644.32'
    text: anything about it is that we happened to
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1647.32'
    text: have a
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '1649'
    text: empirical apparatus set up calibrated
  - dur: '8.32'
    start: '1652.32'
    text: and recording and that recording was
  - dur: '8.239'
    start: '1655.44'
    text: able to save some bare Shadows of data
  - dur: '5.759'
    start: '1660.64'
    text: that we believe are correlated to the
  - dur: '5.441'
    start: '1663.679'
    text: hypothetical true fact of the universe
  - dur: '6'
    start: '1666.399'
    text: of what I was doing in this space in
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '1669.12'
    text: that point of the past um and this
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '1672.399'
    text: particular case
  - dur: '6'
    start: '1674.88'
    text: the the data that we collected
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '1678.559'
    text: is in the form of
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '1680.88'
    text: videos um where a
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1683.32'
    text: video is one of these things I don&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '1686.679'
    text: know if you&amp;#39;ve heard of them they&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '7.16'
    start: '1687.72'
    text: great super useful um super dark so the
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1692'
    text: recordings themselves were not not my
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '1694.88'
    text: greatest work sort of like some of the
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '1696.88'
    text: camera setups were not great it&amp;#39;s super
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '1699.32'
    text: dark um which I think you know so the
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '1701.96'
    text: Fidelity of the data that we&amp;#39;re getting
  - dur: '7.84'
    start: '1704'
    text: is not going to be the best in the
  - dur: '9.52'
    start: '1705.6'
    text: universe um but it&amp;#39;s fine enough um and
  - dur: '7.079'
    start: '1711.84'
    text: so this is a video this is a record of
  - dur: '6.159'
    start: '1715.12'
    text: the data that we recorded and the
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '1718.919'
    text: empirical measurement that this
  - dur: '7.88'
    start: '1721.279'
    text: represents is samples from a particular
  - dur: '7.28'
    start: '1725.399'
    text: cone of light from a particular location
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1729.159'
    text: in space so a video it this is 30 frames
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '1732.679'
    text: per second which is pretty slow for
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '1734.279'
    text: scientific data but standard for most
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '1736.64'
    text: sort of videos that you encounter
  - dur: '6.159'
    start: '1739'
    text: um 30 frames per second
  - dur: '9.841'
    start: '1742.279'
    text: 720p
  - dur: '10.24'
    start: '1745.159'
    text: uh hey hey calm down um so the video
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '1752.12'
    text: is let&amp;#39;s see
  - dur: '3.561'
    start: '1755.399'
    text: 720p by
  - dur: '9.319'
    start: '1759.24'
    text: 1280p 1280 yeah P meaning pixels so if
  - dur: '10.28'
    start: '1763.6'
    text: you see things like HD high def 1080p by
  - dur: '11.48'
    start: '1768.559'
    text: 1920 4K is like whatever whatever 1080 *
  - dur: '7.44'
    start: '1773.88'
    text: 2 is divided by whatever 1920 X2 is and
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '1780.039'
    text: this
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '1781.32'
    text: is a raster plot a raster recording
  - dur: '6.88'
    start: '1785'
    text: raster image
  - dur: '5.719'
    start: '1788.08'
    text: where the 720 is if you count if you
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1791.88'
    text: zoom way into these tiny little pixels
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '1793.799'
    text: and you count them there will be 720 in
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '1796.64'
    text: this direction
  - dur: '6.119'
    start: '1798.44'
    text: and then there be 1,280 in that
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '1801.48'
    text: direction and at each of these little
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '1804.559'
    text: squares there&amp;#39;s actually three
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '1807.84'
    text: recordings one is in the red channel one
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1810.24'
    text: is in the green channel one is in the
  - dur: '6'
    start: '1811.679'
    text: blue Channel and the pixel itself
  - dur: '6.679'
    start: '1815'
    text: represent a number between 0 and
  - dur: '7.961'
    start: '1817.679'
    text: 255 which is 2 to
  - dur: '7.161'
    start: '1821.679'
    text: 8 and if it&amp;#39;s zero it means that that
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1825.64'
    text: tiny little section of that
  - dur: '6.679'
    start: '1828.84'
    text: whatever sensor is on the back of the
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '1830.76'
    text: camera recorded zero intensities of
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '1835.519'
    text: photons um I guess the S would be
  - dur: '4.519'
    start: '1837.88'
    text: Candelas I don&amp;#39;t really know how that
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '1839.44'
    text: works but this little the the number in
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '1842.399'
    text: this spot it will be between zero and
  - dur: '3.199'
    start: '1844.72'
    text: some let&amp;#39;s even let&amp;#39;s not worry about
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '1846.519'
    text: the number let&amp;#39;s just say between zero
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '1847.919'
    text: and one if that seems too complicated to
  - dur: '7.199'
    start: '1850.36'
    text: you we can say between 0 and 100% or
  - dur: '6.881'
    start: '1853.559'
    text: 100% is the maximum value that that
  - dur: '6.441'
    start: '1857.559'
    text: little sensor at that little section of
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '1860.44'
    text: this of the video was able to record so
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '1864'
    text: this is roughly speaking white so that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '1866.72'
    text: going to be 100% active this is roughly
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '1870.6'
    text: speaking black that&amp;#39;s going to be 0%
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '1872.32'
    text: active so we get one of these
  - dur: '6.519'
    start: '1876.88'
    text: images every 33
  - dur: '5.519'
    start: '1881'
    text: milliseconds which at the end results in
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '1883.399'
    text: a a weird thing called a video.
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '1886.519'
    text: MP4 where the before it&amp;#39;s just a file
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '1889.08'
    text: format it&amp;#39;s just like an instruction set
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1890.96'
    text: that the computer uses to be able to
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '1893.279'
    text: turn this into something that our sort
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '1895.36'
    text: of primate eyes like to look
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '1897.639'
    text: at
  - dur: '8.081'
    start: '1899.159'
    text: um yeah and then there&amp;#39;s three of
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '1903.2'
    text: them and sort of analogously to the way
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1907.24'
    text: I&amp;#39;ve talked about Vision before and the
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1909.08'
    text: sort of these truc moments where
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '1911.88'
    text: environmental energy gets transduced
  - dur: '5.959'
    start: '1913.84'
    text: into sort of a different form of energy
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '1916.6'
    text: um and your eyes that&amp;#39;s light is gets
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '1919.799'
    text: absorbed by the opsin and converted into
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1921.559'
    text: like electrochemical potentials or
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '1923.159'
    text: whatever in a camera the light is
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '1926.559'
    text: absorbed by some weird Crystal of
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '1928.36'
    text: silicone and then turned into a pattern
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '1931.159'
    text: of voltages that gets measured and
  - dur: '5.439'
    start: '1933.2'
    text: recorded and converted into this picture
  - dur: '6.119'
    start: '1935.44'
    text: and we believe that there&amp;#39;s something in
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '1938.639'
    text: the pattern of activation on the back of
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '1941.559'
    text: the camera sensor at the different time
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '1943.84'
    text: points of recording that is correlated
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '1947.2'
    text: with the reality of what&amp;#39;s going on in
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1948.799'
    text: the real world um the reason why we
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1951.639'
    text: believe that is because when we look at
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '1953.679'
    text: it we say yeah that looks like a person
  - dur: '3'
    start: '1956.399'
    text: that looks not only does that look like
  - dur: '3.441'
    start: '1957.799'
    text: a person it looks like the person that
  - dur: '3.441'
    start: '1959.399'
    text: was standing in front of the camera at
  - dur: '2.88'
    start: '1961.24'
    text: the time that I saw the person in front
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '1962.84'
    text: of the camera standing there and then
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '1964.12'
    text: the person pushed record so I look at it
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '1966.36'
    text: and I say yeah that seems right I think
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '1968.84'
    text: that I understand how cameras roughly
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '1971.32'
    text: work and it&amp;#39;s that sort of weird
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1974.36'
    text: intuitive gut check of yeah this seems
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '1976.88'
    text: like a vaguely valid recording that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '1979.48'
    text: the empirical basis of everything that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.04'
    start: '1982.2'
    text: going to come after this everything else
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '1983.6'
    text: I&amp;#39;m going to show you is going to be
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '1985.24'
    text: computations that happen on top of on
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '1988.44'
    text: the basis of these sort of Bas level
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1991.36'
    text: initial empirical
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '1993.12'
    text: measurements and it&amp;#39;s kind of fun to
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '1995.6'
    text: talk about this in the context of like
  - dur: '6.081'
    start: '1997.679'
    text: lowquality videos from webcams but I
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '2000.799'
    text: promise you every empirical
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '2003.76'
    text: investigation you do from here on out
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '2006.36'
    text: will have a similar form where there is
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '2008.6'
    text: some empirical measurement unless it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '2010.919'
    text: like a computational study which a whole
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '2012.72'
    text: other thing um well whatever different
  - dur: '5.719'
    start: '2015.32'
    text: thought um there will be some piece of
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '2018.48'
    text: equipment that you will have calibrated
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '2021.039'
    text: against some known value it will be
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '2023.08'
    text: recording some either a singular or a

  - dur: '2.801'
    start: '2036.919'
    text: which typically speaking
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '2038.279'
    text: will be some true fact reality of the
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '2039.72'
    text: world that has gone into the past and
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '2042.559'
    text: may or may not be able to be recorded
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '2044.679'
    text: again in this case you could record me
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '2047.76'
    text: doing the same behavior again but you
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '2049.8'
    text: will never again have the opportunity to
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '2051.679'
    text: record this particular moment in time so
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '2055.52'
    text: this is sort of just like practically
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '2056.879'
    text: speaking as a researcher um this is not
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '2059.72'
    text: particularly precious data because I can
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '2061.679'
    text: just always do it again if this was like
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '2063.839'
    text: a patient like a like an amputee that I
  - dur: '2.921'
    start: '2066.599'
    text: had to recruit and they sort of came
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '2068.119'
    text: across town and they came and stand in
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '2069.52'
    text: front of the thing I did the
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '2071.399'
    text: recording and and if I did that one and
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '2074.8'
    text: it was too dark and I had the cameras
  - dur: '3.399'
    start: '2076.28'
    text: kind of in the wrong spot that&amp;#39;s a much
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '2078.04'
    text: bigger bummer because that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '7.801'
    start: '2079.679'
    text: much harder data recording to
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '2084'
    text: recreate but
  - dur: '7'
    start: '2087.48'
    text: yeah so yeah learn your
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '2090.72'
    text: equipment learn your equipment because
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '2094.48'

    text: recording data you really care about you
  - dur: '6.76'

    text: want to know all the ways it can go
  - dur: '8.599'
    start: '2101.48'
    text: wrong um okay
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '2106.16'
    text: great so oh yeah I have some
  - dur: '3.401'
    start: '2110.079'
    text: other technically speaking there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.04'
    start: '2112'
    text: another empirical measurement here which
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2113.48'
    text: is in the form of the time stamps from
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '2115.04'
    text: the videos so I have measures of like
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '2117.96'
    text: the computer&amp;#39;s like sort of
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '2120.48'
    text: hypothetically nanc scale time stamps
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '2122.64'
    text: from each one of the recorded frames I
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '2125.24'
    text: don&amp;#39;t trust it down to NS but I do trust
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '2127.2'
    text: it down to like
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '2128.96'
    text: milliseconds microsc question mark who
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '2131.76'
    text: knows um this is another thing where if
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '2134.52'
    text: I deleted these time stamps I could also
  - dur: '5.559'
    start: '2136.52'
    text: never recreate those timestamps because
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '2138.68'
    text: videos tend not to actually encode the
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '2142.079'
    text: specific time that the image was
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '2143.88'
    text: recorded they tend to just sort of say
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '2145.72'
    text: this is a 30 FPS video and then play it
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '2147.44'
    text: at 30 frames per second regardless of
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '2149.2'
    text: the variations in time so there&amp;#39;s a many
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '2153.079'
    text: many deeper layers of the freeo cap
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '2155.28'
    text: software which we will never bring up in
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2156.839'
    text: this context
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '2158.64'
    text: relate to this stupid time stamp
  - dur: '7.041'
    start: '2161.359'
    text: recording and getting everything nicely
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2163.92'
    text: temporarily synced between the multiple
  - dur: '7.879'
    start: '2169.48'
    text: cameras so so this is the base data
  - dur: '7.28'
    start: '2174.16'
    text: videos from multiple locations um we
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '2177.359'
    text: also have this calibration data which
  - dur: '6.159'
    start: '2181.44'
    text: tells us where the cameras were in space
  - dur: '7.401'
    start: '2184.319'
    text: um so camera one was trip rotation
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '2187.599'
    text: translation is like position rotation is
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '2191.72'
    text: rotation put them together you have
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '2194.319'
    text: something like orientation 6 degrees of
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '2196.68'
    text: freedom and this is the positions of the
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '2198.68'
    text: cameras this is another one of those
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '2200.56'
    text: cases where if I didn&amp;#39;t have the
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '2202.359'
    text: calibration data for where those cameras
  - dur: '6.119'
    start: '2204.2'
    text: were I can&amp;#39;t recreate it I I proba it
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '2208.04'
    text: would be very difficult to recreate I I
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '2210.319'
    text: actually if I really desperately needed
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '2212.24'
    text: to I could write some code that would
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '2214.28'
    text: allow me to reconstruct the camera
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '2216.4'
    text: positions um um without the the checker
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '2219.52'
    text: board just using a bunch of like like I
  - dur: '2.8'
    start: '2221.48'
    text: could use like marks on the board and
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '2222.92'
    text: stuff like that but I really don&amp;#39;t want
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '2224.28'
    text: to do that so I consider this to also
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '2226.8'
    text: kind of be part of the base data here
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '2228.48'
    text: like if I hadn&amp;#39;t done the calibration or
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '2230.599'
    text: if I had done the calibration wrong um
  - dur: '7.201'
    start: '2233.839'
    text: very difficult to recreate that
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '2237.319'
    text: um so like for example if I had if I was
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '2241.04'
    text: using like the wrong checker board or if
  - dur: '4'
    start: '2243.16'
    text: I had like mistakenly had like another
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '2245.64'
    text: checkerboard in the background and not
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '2247.16'
    text: noticing it then that process would
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '2249.44'
    text: break and I would either have to come
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '2250.92'
    text: through and figure out how to fix it or
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '2252.8'
    text: record the data again this is a so this
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2255.319'
    text: is another thing that someday this may
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '2258.16'
    text: come up in your life but my personal
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '2259.839'
    text: belief and advice to you is it is
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '2262.2'
    text: typically speaking a much much better
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '2264.56'
    text: idea if you record some data and it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '2267.079'
    text: not good data learn the lesson and
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '2269.64'
    text: record it again don&amp;#39;t spend a lot of
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '2271.28'
    text: time trying to fix bad data if you could
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '2273.24'
    text: at all avoid it you can&amp;#39;t always avoid
  - dur: '6.401'
    start: '2275.079'
    text: that but in general given the option
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '2279.52'
    text: just figure out what you did wrong and
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '2281.48'
    text: then record it again that&amp;#39;s my personal
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '2285.24'
    text: advice
  - dur: '7.201'
    start: '2287.319'
    text: uh as a Del leaguered
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '2290.96'
    text: scientist okay so but let&amp;#39;s forget all
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '2294.52'
    text: those and just say the base data is the
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '2296.079'
    text: videos so if that&amp;#39;s the base
  - dur: '7.2'
    start: '2298.96'
    text: data and then
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '2301.76'
    text: this is the other side of that equation
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '2306.16'
    text: this is the output data
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '2308'
    text: this is the approximation let&amp;#39;s turn off
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '2311.319'
    text: the the mesh which is mostly for visuals
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '2314.48'
    text: and
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '2315.599'
    text: let&amp;#39;s this is
  - dur: '5.959'
    start: '2321.16'
    text: the that&amp;#39;s this guy
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '2324.44'
    text: that&amp;#39;s roughly
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '2327.119'
    text: speaking right this is the level of
  - dur: '7.08'
    start: '2330.16'
    text: fidelity that we have reconstructed the
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '2332.68'
    text: the human body to um and look there was
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '2337.24'
    text: a lot of work that went into recreating
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '2339'
    text: it to this level like it was years of my
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '2342'
    text: life and years to come was to produce
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '2344.119'
    text: this data and I&amp;#39;m quite proud of it but
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '2346.2'
    text: also it&amp;#39;s garbage there is nothing like
  - dur: '6.321'
    start: '2348.839'
    text: this is such an impoverished Recreation
  - dur: '6.88'
    start: '2352.16'
    text: of this like this thing is like a couple
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '2355.16'
    text: chunks of wood um and I am several
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2359.04'
    text: trillion cells and billions of neurons
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '2361.56'
    text: and you know thoughts dreams and
  - dur: '6.799'
    start: '2363.52'
    text: histories and stuff like that um the
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '2366.88'
    text: feet here are just like solid blocks
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '2370.319'
    text: whereas my feet have this like very
  - dur: '5.559'
    start: '2372.28'
    text: complicated muscular skeletal structure
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '2375.64'
    text: um and you know this thing doesn&amp;#39;t have
  - dur: '7'
    start: '2377.839'
    text: any neurons it&amp;#39;s all very it&amp;#39;s extremely
  - dur: '7.121'
    start: '2380.839'
    text: impoverished um but it&amp;#39;s the best we
  - dur: '5.041'
    start: '2384.839'
    text: got yeah
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '2387.96'
    text: uh and
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '2389.88'
    text: then all of this
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '2416.88'
    text: ah this point is not worth the time I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '2.52'
    start: '2419.24'
    text: taking to make
  - dur: '4'
    start: '2424.24'
    text: it yeah
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '2438.2'
    text: yeah and then this this is the actual
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '2442.16'
    text: data model that we&amp;#39;re looking at here
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '2443.76'
    text: this is the whole thing boiled down to a
  - dur: '5.239'
    start: '2445.88'
    text: singular Center of mass it doesn&amp;#39;t even
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '2448.64'
    text: have rotation it just has position and
  - dur: '7.081'
    start: '2451.119'
    text: so this is the it&amp;#39;s a long way to make
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '2454.68'
    text: it down to an extremely condensed form
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '2458.2'
    text: an
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '2459.76'
    text: extremely low dimensional representation
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '2462.92'
    text: of something that is reality infinitely
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '2465.48'
    text: dimensional you would require like like
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '2467.52'
    text: I don&amp;#39;t know how many numbers so this
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '2469.52'
    text: thing requires three numbers to
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '2471.16'
    text: perfectly Define its position and space
  - dur: '5'
    start: '2472.76'
    text: at any moment in time I don&amp;#39;t know how
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '2474.72'
    text: many numbers it would take to Define me
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '2477.76'
    text: as a person at any moment in time but
  - dur: '8.159'
    start: '2480.2'
    text: it&amp;#39;s a very very large number this thing
  - dur: '12.561'
    start: '2483.359'
    text: I think 1 two 3 4 five
  - dur: '10.441'
    start: '2488.359'
    text: 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 14 * 3 42 so this
  - dur: '5.919'
    start: '2495.92'
    text: is 13 joints three degrees of freedom
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '2498.8'
    text: this requires 42 numbers to Define at
  - dur: '6.041'
    start: '2501.839'
    text: any moment in time um
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '2505.24'
    text: so yeah if you want to know questions
  - dur: '5.239'
    start: '2507.88'
    text: about things like joint angles this is
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '2510.44'
    text: not sufficient um but if you&amp;#39;re just
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '2513.119'
    text: looking at things like Center of mass
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '2515.2'
    text: versus BAS of support it&amp;#39;s nice to have
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '2518.28'
    text: the low dimensional
  - dur: '8.279'
    start: '2520.8'
    text: output and then I do that I&amp;#39;ll come back
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '2524.88'
    text: I do this it go away
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '2529.359'
    text: great okay so how do we get how do we
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '2532'
    text: sort of get from point A to point B here
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '2535.2'
    text: um well the first thing we have to do is
  - dur: '7'
    start: '2538.48'
    text: just just like a little bit of magic
  - dur: '8.641'
    start: '2540.839'
    text: just like a tiny a tiny chunk of magic
  - dur: '6.92'
    start: '2545.48'
    text: um where by magic of course I mean some
  - dur: '6.599'
    start: '2549.48'
    text: form of stochastic process involving
  - dur: '5'
    start: '2552.4'

    text: of Our Lord
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '2557.4'
    text: 2025 a lot of AI talk everywhere if
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '2560.4'
    text: you&amp;#39;ve been paying attention there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.68'

    text: rumel Hart and some other guy uh
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '2577.64'
    text: came up with back propagation which is a
  - dur: '6.159'
    start: '2579.4'
    text: very important technique that basically
  - dur: '7.441'
    start: '2581.319'
    text: makes uh neural networks sort of work
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '2585.559'
    text: um and so there lot so and everything
  - dur: '3.079'
    start: '2588.76'
    text: since then it&amp;#39;s sort of now now
  - dur: '3.521'

    text: everything has the term AI in it which
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '2591.839'
    text: is basically just like a marketing term
  - dur: '6.679'
    start: '2593.64'
    text: that means a neural network that has

    start: '2596.48'
    text: language capacity
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '2601.16'
    text: um and this is kind of a problem like I
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '2604.76'
    text: obviously like AI we&amp;#39;re using in this
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '2606.319'
    text: class like a lot um but it&amp;#39;s a problem
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '2609.44'
    text: it&amp;#39;s a problem empirically because
  - dur: '7.24'
    start: '2612.079'
    text: machine learning will sort of I think by
  - dur: '6.28'

    start: '2732.48'
    text: involves a machine learning algorithm

    text: and it is this part right here it this
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '2740.28'
    text: the step of the process where we convert
  - dur: '6.601'
    start: '2742.559'
    text: the video into something that&amp;#39;s a lower
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '2746.119'
    text: dimensional and directly related to the

    start: '2749.16'
    text: thing that we care about
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '2751.24'
    text: involves bit of jargon here um a
  - dur: '2.8'
    start: '2754.68'
    text: convolutional neural network which is
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '2756.44'
    text: basically
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '2757.48'
    text: lives in the it&amp;#39;s a trained model that
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '2759.599'
    text: was trained on many many many hand
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '2762.76'
    text: labeled videos hand labeled images where
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '2765.319'
    text: people went through images of people and
  - dur: '3.161'
    start: '2768.599'
    text: then marked out these are where the
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '2770.28'
    text: shoulders are this is where the hips are
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '2771.76'
    text: this is where the the the wrist is and
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '2774.079'
    text: so the the neural network and the
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '2776.68'
    text: convolutional part just means that it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '2778.04'
    text: sort of like running this kind of like
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '2780.319'
    text: search pattern over the image looking
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2782.76'
    text: for something so like the ankle detector
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '2785.119'
    text: is just looking for ankles at all times
  - dur: '3.279'
    start: '2787.28'
    text: and when it gets down here it&amp;#39;s actually
  - dur: '2.56'
    start: '2789.16'
    text: more it&amp;#39;s like a right ankle they have
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '2790.559'
    text: like a right ankle detector and a left
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '2791.72'
    text: ankle detector and so it says oh there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '2794.88'
    text: probably an ankle in this part of the
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '2797.319'
    text: screen and then you take the peak of
  - dur: '2.799'
    start: '2800.28'
    text: that probability curve you draw a DOT on
  - dur: '1.881'
    start: '2802.119'
    text: it and then we say that&amp;#39;s where the
  - dur: '2.52'
    start: '2803.079'
    text: ankle
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '2804'
    text: is
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '2805.599'
    text: um this is weird magic this is one of
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '2808.599'
    text: those things that like shouldn&amp;#39;t be
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '2810.559'
    text: possible and yet here we are um before
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '2813.44'
    text: 2007 it wasn&amp;#39;t sorry 2017 it wasn&amp;#39;t POS
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '2817.319'
    text: you couldn&amp;#39;t do this then in 2017 some
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '2819.8'
    text: folks from Carnegie melon published a
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '2821.4'
    text: paper called open open pose released a
  - dur: '5'
    start: '2825'
    text: model called open pose um and it was the
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '2828.24'
    text: first it they were building on existing
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '2830'
    text: models and existing techniques and they
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '2832.359'
    text: produced an output that sort of could

    text: screen if you just Google open pose now
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '2840.2'
    text: you&amp;#39;ll find the repo it&amp;#39;s a bit of a
  - dur: '6.639'
    start: '2842.2'
    text: nightmare to use but very useful thing
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '2845.16'
    text: to come out um
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2849.92'
    text: and so that is the the weird jumping
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '2852.359'
    text: technology that makes any of the rest of
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '2854.44'
    text: this possible
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2856.599'
    text: because video has always been kind of
  - dur: '7'
    start: '2858.599'
    text: been a very strange form of data because

    start: '2861.119'
    text: for us as visually gifted primates we
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '2865.599'
    text: are exceptionally good at looking at

    start: '2867.68'
    text: videos and extracting a lot of

    start: '2869.76'
    text: information and we you do that all the

    text: historically one of the best methods
  - dur: '5.079'

    text: watching videos of babies doing stuff
  - dur: '6.161'

    text: that sort of like manual labeling of

    text: sort of like regain some of the like the
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '3026.76'
    text: trust that we have in processes like

    text: network or a machine learning algorithm
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '3036.48'
    text: or an AI or something like that so this
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '3038.88'
    text: is sort of part of the epistemology of
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '3041.92'
    text: it so epistemology study of knowledge
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '3043.599'
    text: study of you know like how do you how do
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '3047.2'
    text: you feel like you know things um and the
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '3049.52'
    text: reason why I trust this data is because
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '3052.839'
    text: the step of the process that I trust the
  - dur: '6.88'
    start: '3054.88'
    text: least is visually
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '3057.16'
    text: verifiable and I have looked like I
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3061.76'
    text: don&amp;#39;t because I I know this process well
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '3063.88'
    text: enough I no longer have to spot check
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '3065.76'
    text: all the videos to trust them um because
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '3068.64'
    text: I&amp;#39;ve done that enough that I can say
  - dur: '6.841'
    start: '3070.079'
    text: okay this is a vaguely big word here not
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '3074.2'
    text: important term here uh this is a truth
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '3076.92'
    text: preserving process I believe that this
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '3079.48'
    text: step is not throwing fake into
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '3082'
    text: my computational engine so I now trust
  - dur: '5.439'
    start: '3084.4'
    text: the output there&amp;#39;s a lot of there are
  - dur: '7'
    start: '3087.4'
    text: other paid softwares that do marketless
  - dur: '6.361'
    start: '3089.839'
    text: motion capture um and as far as I
  - dur: '2.88'
    start: '3094.4'
    text: understand it most or all of them we
  - dur: '2.72'
    start: '3096.2'
    text: don&amp;#39;t really know because they&amp;#39;re closed
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '3097.28'
    text: Source but I have like various people on
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '3098.92'
    text: the inside they have a step in their
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '3101.48'
    text: process where they use a machine
  - dur: '3.881'
    start: '3102.839'
    text: learning algorithm to clean their data
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '3105.24'
    text: so where there&amp;#39;s like Jiggles and
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '3106.72'
    text: wiggles and like weird stuff going on
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '3109.16'
    text: they have a neural network that that is
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '3111.2'
    text: trained to clean that data for them and
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '3113.88'
    text: produce data that doesn&amp;#39;t have that
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '3115.599'
    text: noise in it that is a nontruth
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '3117.92'
    text: preserving process because you can&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '3.121'
    start: '3119.559'
    text: spot check it but that&amp;#39;s okay for them
  - dur: '3'
    start: '3121.559'
    text: because they&amp;#39;re generally producing this
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '3122.68'
    text: for like artists and stuff like that but
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '3124.559'
    text: you cannot do that if you want the data
  - dur: '6.321'
    start: '3126.319'
    text: to come out scientifically and
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '3128.319'
    text: empirically valid um anyways moving on
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '3132.64'
    text: so
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '3133.72'
    text: um great so we&amp;#39;ve done this this is the
  - dur: '10.879'
    start: '3136.72'
    text: high technology part this is the weird
  - dur: '8.76'
    start: '3138.839'
    text: Magic Box part um and the output of that
  - dur: '6.679'
    start: '3151.16'
    text: is where are
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '3153.559'
    text: we we crashing what&amp;#39;s going
  - dur: '3'
    start: '3159.96'
    text: 'on'
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '3164.319'
    text: great oh
  - dur: '7.2'
    start: '3166.359'
    text: well so the output of that is going to
  - dur: '7.721'
    start: '3170.559'
    text: be so let ignoring ignoring the face
  - dur: '7.52'
    start: '3173.559'
    text: it&amp;#39;s going to be XY positions of
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '3178.28'
    text: I think it&amp;#39;s I forget how many there are
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '3181.079'
    text: like 32 not counting the face and hands
  - dur: '6.041'
    start: '3183.359'
    text: I think there&amp;#39;s like 32 points in this
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '3185.68'
    text: particular uh stick figure guy um and so
  - dur: '7.84'
    start: '3189.4'
    text: on each frame of each video there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '7.52'
    start: '3192.64'
    text: going to be 32 * 2 numbers produced and
  - dur: '2.92'
    start: '3197.24'
    text: those numbers are going to
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '3204.799'
    text: be with an image 0 0 is at the upper
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '3207.64'
    text: left so you sort of you count you start
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '3209.76'
    text: here and you count that
  - dur: '7.839'
    start: '3211.72'
    text: way um so that&amp;#39;s why we tend to think
  - dur: '6.561'
    start: '3215.839'
    text: of X as this way and Y as that way but
  - dur: '6.321'
    start: '3219.559'
    text: for image coordinates it&amp;#39;s X is this way
  - dur: '6.199'
    start: '3222.4'
    text: and Y is that way so it it&amp;#39;s confusing
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '3225.88'
    text: because the top left corner is zero and
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3228.599'
    text: then the bottom corner is 1280 so you
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '3231.04'
    text: count upwards going down you get used to
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '3233.599'
    text: it
  - dur: '9.76'
    start: '3234.88'
    text: um this it&amp;#39;s like it&amp;#39;s like that so the
  - dur: '6.321'
    start: '3238.319'
    text: Z is the depth plane into the thing um
  - dur: '10.48'
    start: '3245.359'
    text: so X Y pixel X pixel y so for one frame
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '3252.4'
    text: for one joint you get you know the the
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '3255.839'
    text: position of that joint in two Dimensions
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '3258.48'
    text: with the units in this case are
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '3261.319'
    text: pixels
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '3263.96'
    text: um you then do
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '3275.92'
    text: uh once you have that two-dimensional
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '3278.28'
    text: data and you have you already have the
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '3280.28'
    text: position of the cameras that&amp;#39;s when you
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '3282.359'
    text: can do the triangulation step where you
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '3284.68'
    text: got camera One camera
  - dur: '10.8'
    start: '3287.559'
    text: two so
  - dur: '10.08'
    start: '3290.44'
    text: camera 1 2 3 this is me and then camera
  - dur: '5.521'
    start: '3298.359'
    text: one
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '3300.52'
    text: sees the position of this there camera 2
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '3303.88'
    text: sees it there camera 3 sees it there and
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '3307.48'
    text: then
  - dur: '7.079'
    start: '3308.28'
    text: using epipolar geometry which is you
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '3311.4'
    text: know this is like old school geometry um
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '3315.359'
    text: I&amp;#39;m not sure where epipolar geometry
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '3316.88'
    text: exactly what era that is from but this
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '3319.92'
    text: gets down to like similar triangles and
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '3322.48'
    text: like uid and like like like old school
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '3325.039'
    text: geometry um is how you sort of you do
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3328.319'
    text: this kind of like triangulation math
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '3330.72'
    text: where you kind of like by because you
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '3332.319'
    text: know the position of each camera if you
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '3334.92'
    text: can if you can identify the location of
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '3337.52'
    text: the pixel from the point of view of that
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3339.2'
    text: camera you can do the math and figure
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '3340.92'
    text: out the 3D location so the way to think
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '3343.2'
    text: about that is like imagine you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '3345.72'
    text: standing on a a rooftop somewhere and
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '3349.039'
    text: you have a laser pointer and you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '3351.119'
    text: pointing it at some Target you can know
  - dur: '3.399'
    start: '3354.44'
    text: from your position it&amp;#39;s like okay I had
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '3355.68'
    text: to move like over this far and then down
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '3357.839'
    text: this far so you know the direction that
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '3359.48'
    text: that thing is in but you can&amp;#39;t tell how
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '3361.92'
    text: far away it is because your laser
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '3363.319'
    text: doesn&amp;#39;t tell you that so if you have a
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '3365.48'
    text: friend on another rooftop and they are
  - dur: '3.359'
    start: '3368.24'
    text: also pointing their laser at that Target
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '3370.4'
    text: they know that I had to turn this way
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '3371.599'
    text: and down that way um they also know the
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '3374.96'
    text: the the direction of the target but they
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '3376.319'
    text: don&amp;#39;t know the depth so now imagine it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '3379.319'
    text: like a foggy night and you&amp;#39;re standing
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '3380.96'
    text: on still another third rooftop and you
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '3383.799'
    text: can see those two laser paths and you
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '3386.52'
    text: can see where they cross over that place
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '3388.64'
    text: where those two lasers cross over that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '6.601'
    start: '3390.319'
    text: the position of the thing that that
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '3393.319'
    text: that&amp;#39;s that they&amp;#39;re targeting um and so
  - dur: '2.76'
    start: '3396.92'
    text: if you know where those two people are
  - dur: '2.92'
    start: '3398.24'
    text: in space and you know the direction that
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '3399.68'
    text: they&amp;#39;re pointing the lasers you can
  - dur: '7.199'
    start: '3401.16'
    text: calculate the XY Z threedimensional
  - dur: '5.521'
    start: '3405.359'
    text: position of the the the object in
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '3408.359'
    text: question and then again you do
  - dur: '6'
    start: '3410.88'
    text: that 30 times per
  - dur: '6.959'
    start: '3413.64'
    text: second uh several hundred times per
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '3416.88'
    text: frame and you get these numbers out so
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '3420.599'
    text: again this part is all this is all
  - dur: '7.199'
    start: '3423.16'
    text: computation this is truth preserving
  - dur: '6.92'
    start: '3425'
    text: math this is um yeah hard numbers hard
  - dur: '3.121'
    start: '3430.359'
    text: math do the same thing you&amp;#39;d get the
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '3431.92'
    text: same number get the same answer every
  - dur: '3'
    start: '3433.48'
    text: time
  - dur: '3'
    start: '3436.599'
    text: um
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '3440.44'
    text: yeah and I guess I should say um
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '3443.76'
    text: assuming perfect data from the
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '3445.359'
    text: two-dimensional stuff
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '3446.72'
    text: the accuracy of this data is going to be
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '3449.079'
    text: dependent on the accuracy of your
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '3451.599'
    text: calibration so if you were off in the
  - dur: '4.479'
    start: '3453.88'
    text: calibration then you&amp;#39;re going to be off
  - dur: '3.561'
    start: '3456.359'
    text: in the position of the cameras and so
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '3458.359'
    text: you&amp;#39;re going to be off in the pedist
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '3459.92'
    text: position of the estimated position of
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '3462.079'
    text: the threedimensional
  - dur: '6.8'
    start: '3463.64'
    text: object
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '3465.68'
    text: um that&amp;#39;s called what do we call that
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '3471.72'
    text: uh accumulating error it&amp;#39;s not
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '3473.799'
    text: accumulating error but
  - dur: '2.28'
    start: '3476.64'
    text: yeah
  - dur: '7.921'
    start: '3479.359'
    text: it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s whatever it&amp;#39;s you know the the
  - dur: '8.52'
    start: '3483.319'
    text: the the verasity the truth value of this
  - dur: '7'
    start: '3487.28'
    text: measurement derives its truthiness from
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '3491.839'
    text: the validity of the camera position
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '3494.28'
    text: estimation and the validity of the
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '3497.319'
    text: position in the
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '3499.76'
    text: image
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '3502.28'
    text: um yeah and let&amp;#39;s not even start asking
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '3505.16'
    text: questions around like when you say that
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '3507.24'
    text: my shoulder is
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '3509.799'
    text: here why is it here or is it here or is
  - dur: '3.201'
    start: '3513.039'
    text: it here or is it here what what are we
  - dur: '3.561'
    start: '3514.599'
    text: targeting there is it some anatomical
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '3516.24'
    text: thing is it the is it the muscle is it
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '3518.16'
    text: the meat is it let&amp;#39;s not even ask those
  - dur: '4.479'
    start: '3520.64'
    text: questions yet
  - dur: '6.759'
    start: '3523.28'
    text: um
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '3525.119'
    text: orever well maybe someday
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '3532.24'
    text: uh
  - dur: '6.961'
    start: '3533.799'
    text: so uh
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '3537.599'
    text: now after all of this we
  - dur: '7.24'
    start: '3540.76'
    text: have
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '3542.88'

    start: '3554.559'
    text: there we have the 3D position of the
  - dur: '9.121'
    start: '3558.039'
    text: body in space and it looks something
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '3561.76'
    text: like that not like that um so
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '3567.16'
    text: actually I wanted to see the mesh where
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '3568.48'
    text: is the mesh mesh
  - dur: '6.919'
    start: '3577.4'
    text: mesh and so looking
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '3580.72'
    text: at this point that point and then the
  - dur: '5.441'
    start: '3584.319'
    text: point over there triangulated gives you
  - dur: '6.159'
    start: '3586.96'
    text: this point right here which is the XYZ
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '3589.76'
    text: position of my shoulder which in this
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '3593.119'
    text: particular
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '3594.24'
    text: case looks like
  - dur: '8.121'
    start: '3599.119'
    text: its position
  - dur: '11.601'
    start: '3600.359'
    text: is uh 1.6 M up and then 2728 M on the
  - dur: '8.4'
    start: '3607.24'
    text: ground so I&amp;#39;m like roughly 1.8 m tall
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '3611.96'
    text: so seems to check out there um oh I
  - dur: '2.959'
    start: '3615.64'
    text: didn&amp;#39;t mention there there&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '3616.799'
    text: conversion into meter step that comes
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '3618.599'
    text: from the fact that I know the size of
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '3620.079'
    text: the squares on that board otherwise
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '3622.079'
    text: these would come out in like arbitrary
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '3624.44'
    text: numbers that are based off of like
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '3626.4'
    text: pixels and stuff like that actually it
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '3628.2'
    text: would come out in units of the size of
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '3630'
    text: the square on that board so at some
  - dur: '2.68'
    start: '3632'
    text: point in the process I literally just
  - dur: '3.879'
    start: '3633.44'
    text: multiply the numbers that come out of
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '3634.68'
    text: the triangulation by 58 which is the
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '3637.319'
    text: millimeter distance millimeter scale of
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '3639.88'
    text: that square and then divide that by a
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '3642.799'
    text: thousand and you get meters
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '3645.559'
    text: so roughly accurate but also for most of
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '3648.359'
    text: the things that I do in my life the
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '3651.2'
    text: number doesn&amp;#39;t super matter um like the
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '3654.52'
    text: specific units the number doesn&amp;#39;t matter
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '3656.44'
    text: what matters is like you know where is
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3658.839'
    text: it on on frame one versus frame 10 and
  - dur: '3.04'
    start: '3662.319'
    text: you know what&amp;#39;s the relative difference
  - dur: '7.2'
    start: '3663.839'
    text: like this one is twice as many as that
  - dur: '8.121'
    start: '3665.359'
    text: one and stuff like that um okay
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '3671.039'
    text: so now this is also one of those places
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '3673.48'
    text: where there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a certain
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '3675.48'
    text: intuition thing that I did which you may
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '3677.96'
    text: or may not have been offended by where I
  - dur: '3.481'
    start: '3680.799'
    text: was talking about these computational
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '3682.319'
    text: measurements and then I said and here
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '3684.28'
    text: you go that&amp;#39;s the data and and I pointed
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '3686.44'
    text: to the output of what is clearly a
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '3689.16'
    text: visualization software this is not data
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '3692.88'
    text: in the sense of like I can&amp;#39;t do math on
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '3694.92'
    text: this this is like a DOT floating in
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '3696.52'
    text: space you can tell that it&amp;#39;s related to
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '3699.24'
    text: some like hard numbers which must come
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3701.2'
    text: from somewhere but this is not the data
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '3703.559'
    text: this is a visual representation of the
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '3705.2'
    text: data which is a very very very useful
  - dur: '9'
    start: '3708'
    text: thing to have but the actual data in
  - dur: '8.44'
    start: '3711.24'
    text: this particular case lives in
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '3717'
    text: this such a
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '3719.68'
    text: thing let&amp;#39;s make
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '3724.52'
    text: this this type of a file called a CSV
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '3729.48'
    text: which stands for comma separated
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '3731.64'
    text: value
  - dur: '3.401'
    start: '3733.319'
    text: uh which
  - dur: '7.201'
    start: '3737.279'
    text: is here you go so Knows X knows y knows
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '3742.44'
    text: Z there&amp;#39;s a number there&amp;#39;s a comma
  - dur: '2.68'
    start: '3744.48'
    text: there&amp;#39;s a number there&amp;#39;s a comma there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '3746'
    text: number there&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '3747.16'
    text: comma and
  - dur: '6.121'
    start: '3749.839'
    text: there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot of these things
  - dur: '6.839'
    start: '3753.24'
    text: there&amp;#39;s a lot of these numbers look at
  - dur: '8.159'
    start: '3755.96'
    text: all these numbers oh boy
  - dur: '6.881'
    start: '3760.079'
    text: and so we have and then so CSV is a very
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '3764.119'
    text: standard data format um you probably
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '3766.96'
    text: know it in its Microsoft proprietary
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '3768.799'
    text: form which is XLS which is an Excel
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '3771.48'
    text: spreadsheet an Excel spreadsheet under
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '3773.599'
    text: the hood just csvs with a bunch of for
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '3776.2'
    text: formatting um so in the same way that I
  - dur: '6.361'
    start: '3778.559'
    text: rail against
  - dur: '6.839'
    start: '3780.72'
    text: uh like what&amp;#39;s it called um a dockx file
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '3784.92'
    text: and I say I prefer things like markdown
  - dur: '6.441'
    start: '3787.559'
    text: this is where I rail against things like
  - dur: '7.639'
    start: '3789.2'
    text: xlsx and say I prefer CSV but it is also
  - dur: '7.079'
    start: '3794'
    text: kind of annoying to view it like that um
  - dur: '6'
    start: '3796.839'
    text: so we can open it and this is Libre
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '3801.079'
    text: office version of
  - dur: '7.321'
    start: '3802.839'
    text: excel I don&amp;#39;t really use Excel or Excel
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '3806.359'
    text: like objects for anything um except for
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '3810.16'
    text: once or twice a year opening it up to
  - dur: '5.519'
    start: '3812.52'
    text: show to a room full of undergrads and be
  - dur: '6.119'
    start: '3814.2'
    text: like ooh look at all the numbers um
  - dur: '7.481'
    start: '3818.039'
    text: default file format not whatever go to
  - dur: '10.24'
    start: '3820.319'
    text: town um oh why am I looking over there
  - dur: '7.96'
    start: '3825.52'
    text: um so again so libbre office cal um
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '3830.559'
    text: Microsoft Excel uh
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '3833.48'
    text: Google Sheets
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '3836.4'
    text: sheets um these are all applications
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '3839.72'
    text: that can that can slurp up um so CSV is
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '3843.52'
    text: comma separated value can also have tab
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '3845.44'
    text: separated value these are all just the
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '3846.92'
    text: limited values whatever doesn&amp;#39;t matter
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '3849.52'
    text: um and so this is just a nice format
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '3851.559'
    text: that takes the values where the columns
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '3855.68'
    text: are the names of one of the kinds of
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '3857.839'
    text: data that you have and then in this case
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '3860.48'
    text: the row is the frame number although I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '3862.96'
    text: looking at this now it&amp;#39;s like
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '3866.279'
    text: this shouldn&amp;#39;t be there and there should
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '3867.64'
    text: be a column called frame number and
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '3870.24'
    text: another one called time stamp but we&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '3873.2'
    text: get there
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '3876.599'
    text: um and yeah and then there&amp;#39;s as many
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '3879.039'
    text: rows as there are frames in the video
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '3882.799'
    text: and the reason why I like sort of
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '3884.2'
    text: pulling this stuff up is to do kind of
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '3888.039'
    text: like like this little journey we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '3889.92'
    text: going on is meant to kind of do multiple
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '3891.96'
    text: things to your brain one is that there
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '3894.48'
    text: there should be a level of this that
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '3896.039'
    text: just makes total sense like it you know
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '3898'
    text: like sure maybe you know the the the
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '3900.96'
    text: geometry maybe don&amp;#39;t know the math you
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '3903.16'
    text: know maybe you&amp;#39;re not familiar with how
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '3904.68'
    text: convolutional neural networks work um
  - dur: '2.439'
    start: '3906.88'
    text: but generally speaking it&amp;#39;s like okay
  - dur: '3.199'
    start: '3908.16'
    text: sure like what you&amp;#39;re what you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '3909.319'
    text: describing makes some vague kind of
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '3911.359'
    text: sense if I desperately needed to I could
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '3914.52'
    text: go through with a marker and just Mark
  - dur: '4.241'
    start: '3916.279'
    text: frame by frame and measure the distance
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '3918.319'
    text: from the sides and the pixels and if I
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '3920.52'
    text: desperately needed to I could do that by
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '3922.559'
    text: hand I could go through and I could
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '3925.319'
    text: figure out this geometry and calculate
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '3927.039'
    text: It Out by hand I could do all that kind
  - dur: '7.559'
    start: '3929'
    text: of stuff
  - dur: '8.399'
    start: '3931.16'
    text: um but never in a 100 lifetimes could I
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '3936.559'
    text: do it this many times could I do it this
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '3939.559'
    text: fast and uh and I certainly couldn&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '3943.079'
    text: then take that and then
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3945.2'
    text: draw
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '3946.76'
    text: whatever
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '3949.2'
    text: 392 images that I can then flip book
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '3953.119'
    text: from as many angles as I want so I can
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '3955.72'
    text: and look at the data and interrogate the
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '3957.48'
    text: data this is just long story short why
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '3960.4'
    text: computers are very useful things to have
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '3962.96'
    text: it&amp;#39;s not because they&amp;#39;re smart it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '3964.599'
    text: because they&amp;#39;re dumb super fast like
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '3967.599'
    text: they can only do exactly what you tell
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3970'
    text: them to do but they can do it very very
  - dur: '6.401'
    start: '3972.559'
    text: quickly so for you for those of y&amp;#39;all
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '3975'
    text: who may encounter some depths of
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '3978.96'
    text: computers at some point in your life if
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '3980.64'
    text: you write program write code stuff like
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '3982.44'
    text: that um there will come a time actually
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '3985.96'
    text: out all of you there will come a time
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3988.4'
    text: when you think man this computer is
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '3990.52'
    text: really either this computer&amp;#39;s really
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '3992.4'
    text: smart in which case it&amp;#39;s not humans were
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '3994.96'
    text: smart and they made the dumb box of
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '3996.64'
    text: rocks do very clever things um or you&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '2.919'
    start: '3999.64'
    text: get if you&amp;#39;re writing code you&amp;#39;ll be mad
  - dur: '3.401'
    start: '4001.319'
    text: at the computer because it did something
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '4002.559'
    text: you didn&amp;#39;t want it to do I am here to
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '4004.72'
    text: promise you the computer did exactly
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '4006.96'
    text: what you told it to it followed its
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '4008.68'
    text: instructions precisely to the letter and
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '4010.88'
    text: if the output was not what you
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '4012.88'
    text: wanted it is in fact your fault
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '4021.4'
    text: so yeah so these are this is a big W of
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '4025.599'
    text: numbers
  - dur: '8.36'
    start: '4028.16'
    text: and uh and that&amp;#39;s not even all of them
  - dur: '7.641'
    start: '4032.319'
    text: um that&amp;#39;s just the body there are other
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '4036.52'
    text: similar data structures for the face the
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '4039.96'
    text: left hand the right hand and then still
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '4042.599'
    text: another
  - dur: '8.321'
    start: '4043.599'
    text: for the Center of
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '4048.279'
    text: mass where this one
  - dur: '5.881'
    start: '4053.599'
    text: is remember if I did that yeah so this
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '4057.52'
    text: is the center of mass data just the
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '4059.48'
    text: center of mass data and this one instead
  - dur: '6.76'

    start: '4119.88'
    text: we go from that unbelievably High

    start: '4121.88'
    text: dimensional data down
  - dur: '8.96'

    text: this this here is a zoomed out picture

    text: of the full document so each of these
  - dur: '7.081'

    text: columns is one of the data types there
  - dur: '9.28'
    start: '4145.6'
    text: and so from all of that we go
  - dur: '9.72'
    start: '4148.92'
    text: down even further to this there you
  - dur: '6.959'
    start: '4154.88'
    text: go um and the nice thing about this is
  - dur: '6.559'
    start: '4158.64'
    text: that my this starts to get to the place

    start: '4161.839'
    text: where your brain might start thinking
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4165.199'
    text: yeah I can okay I can handle this this
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '4168.279'
    text: is more tractable this is something I
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '4170.199'
    text: can fit into my head
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4173.48'
    text: um
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '4175.279'
    text: and and so and so from that place of
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '4178.4'
    text: kind of like mental comfort you can
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '4180.48'
    text: start asking scientific questions that
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4183.56'
    text: sort of relate to the thing that you
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4185.199'
    text: actually care about which is how does
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4188.08'
    text: this thing stand up right let&amp;#39;s make
  - dur: '6.081'
    start: '4190.239'
    text: some assumptions that somewhere
  - dur: '7.08'
    start: '4193'
    text: between this hyper simplified model of
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '4196.32'
    text: the thing and the true facts of reality
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '4200.08'
    text: there is such a thing as a nervous
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '4201.6'
    text: system and that that that has such
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '4203.239'
    text: characteristics as peripheral and
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '4205.56'
    text: Central and motor hierarchy and cortex
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '4208.88'
    text: and cerebellums and brain stems and all
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '4211.4'
    text: that stuff let&amp;#39;s assume that this is
  - dur: '3.719'
    start: '4213.96'
    text: sort of happening in in the context of
  - dur: '7.76'
    start: '4215.88'
    text: all that sort of fancy Neuroscience
  - dur: '7.201'
    start: '4217.679'
    text: stuff which luckily we in this room um
  - dur: '3.2'
    start: '4223.64'
    text: we don&amp;#39;t have to do all that research
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '4224.88'
    text: ourselves because we can go and look at
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '4226.84'
    text: what other people have said about it we
  - dur: '3.881'
    start: '4228.679'
    text: like I don&amp;#39;t have to do research on the
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '4230.48'
    text: cerebellum directly I can just read
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '4232.56'
    text: about the people who are doing the much
  - dur: '4.241'
    start: '4234.679'
    text: more constrained kind of biological
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '4236.719'
    text: wetwear like let&amp;#39;s look at rabbits in
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4238.92'
    text: uncomfortable positions sort of um like
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '4242.159'
    text: like like hardcore low-level
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '4243.96'
    text: reductionist neuroscience and I can
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '4246.56'
    text: incorporate what they tell me about
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '4248.32'
    text: these sort of n neural systems and
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '4250.32'
    text: subsystems into my attempts to
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '4253.12'
    text: understand and represent this data at a
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '4256.04'
    text: scale that&amp;#39;s just not amenable to that
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '4258.52'
    text: level of sort of like neural
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4261.88'
    text: biological
  - dur: '7.08'
    start: '4268.76'
    text: Precision let&amp;#39;s do it
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '4272.84'
    text: so
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '4275.84'
    text: okay so with all of that context I have
  - dur: '6.681'
    start: '4278.719'
    text: 20 minutes left uh which I think is just
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '4281.48'
    text: barely enough time to kind of like make
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '4285.4'
    text: the main point of differentiation
  - dur: '6.719'
    start: '4287.96'
    text: between the data from those two
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '4291.36'
    text: recordings um so before we do that I
  - dur: '3.04'
    start: '4294.679'
    text: think that&amp;#39;s I think that&amp;#39;s enough time
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '4295.76'
    text: to do that anyone to have is there
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '4297.719'
    text: anything to say
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '4299.08'
    text: about all the nonsense I said before
  - dur: '2.36'
    start: '4302'
    text: before
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '4304.48'
    text: this a lot of it&amp;#39;s kind of like
  - dur: '3.319'
    start: '4306.32'
    text: intuition pump there a little bit of
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '4308.12'
    text: like there&amp;#39;s like a song and dance
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '4309.639'
    text: happening um again kind of in that space
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '4312.48'
    text: of like I&amp;#39;m trying to say a bunch of
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '4314.44'
    text: stuff that just makes sense and kind of
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '4315.96'
    text: you already knew at some intuitive level
  - dur: '5.719'
    start: '4317.92'
    text: but just like making that very very
  - dur: '7.4'
    start: '4319.52'
    text: specific point about the data flow and
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '4323.639'
    text: sort of the computational pipeline from
  - dur: '3.239'
    start: '4326.92'
    text: the sort of empirical measurement in the
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '4328.6'
    text: form of this transduction of
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '4330.159'
    text: environmental energy into electrons and
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '4333.639'
    text: voltages and then the various sort of
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '4336.32'
    text: conversions and computations and
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '4338.48'
    text: calculations that we have to take that
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '4340.8'
    text: sort of Base data to to get it to the
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '4343.32'
    text: place where we can sort of start doing
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '4344.719'
    text: the actual Empirical research
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '4347'
    text: investigation and again let not sort of
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '4350.639'
    text: let&amp;#39;s not also shy away from the fact
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '4352.4'
    text: that I skipped an unbelievable number of
  - dur: '4.241'
    start: '4355.199'
    text: steps at a lot of that part not just in
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '4358.12'
    text: the part where I&amp;#39;m actually doing the
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '4359.44'
    text: calculations myself but just in the
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4361.48'
    text: basics of like how a freaking camera
  - dur: '5.521'
    start: '4363.239'
    text: works like the I know vaguely how a
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '4366.4'
    text: camera works at an engineering level but
  - dur: '5.479'
    start: '4368.76'
    text: not not that specifically let alone like
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '4371.76'
    text: how it sends signals down like a wire
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '4374.239'
    text: and that gets absorbed
  - dur: '6.799'
    start: '4375.92'
    text: by the USB port which is handled by the
  - dur: '7.08'
    start: '4378.52'
    text: USB Foundation which is some unknown
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '4382.719'
    text: cabal of probably hundreds to thousands
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4385.6'
    text: of humans who have been working on how
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '4388.28'
    text: do you read data out of a voltage pin of
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '4390.6'
    text: a little rectangular port on a computer
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4394.32'
    text: um for decades now then it goes into the
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '4397.08'
    text: computer and there&amp;#39;s CPUs and there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '4398.84'
    text: RAM and there&amp;#39;s hard drives like the
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '4401.4'
    text: processes that go into all of this stuff
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '4403.56'
    text: this is why you know this is this is why
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '4406.84'
    text: like no human ever operates alone
  - dur: '3.361'
    start: '4409.239'
    text: because we are all standing on each
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '4410.56'
    text: other&amp;#39;s shoulders and we are all
  - dur: '7.72'
    start: '4412.6'
    text: using the lifetimes of Labor of other
  - dur: '7.16'
    start: '4416.28'
    text: people in our vicinity to be able to
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '4420.32'
    text: with any luck ignore that part and focus
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '4423.44'
    text: on the things that we&amp;#39;re actually
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4424.4'
    text: looking at Also let&amp;#39;s not speak about
  - dur: '3.799'

    text: mostly volunteers for free since like

    start: '4438.32'
    text: 1993 um or python which is the code that
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '4440.92'
    text: I use to write the analysis code which
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '4442.84'
    text: is another open source project that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '2.599'
    start: '4444.6'
    text: been around for
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '4447.36'
    text: decades or any or any of the history of
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '4449.88'
    text: computation and sort of how we got to
  - dur: '5.761'
    start: '4452.639'
    text: that point or the Metallurgy to make the
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '4455.679'

  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4458.4'
    text: even
  - dur: '7.16'
    start: '4459.88'
    text: knows it&amp;#39;s overwhelming so we boil it
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '4463.44'
    text: down and we move on
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '4469.36'
    text: um yes
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '4473.36'
    text: great it&amp;#39;s the existential crises where

    start: '4475.88'
    text: the real learning
  - dur: '8.681'
    start: '4484.719'

    text: am standing this is this is Skelly

    start: '4525.52'
    text: this is Skelly skelly&amp;#39;s the logo freeat

    text: Foundation good job buddy um I have
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '4531.56'
    text: roughly similar bones in my body so
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '4534.36'
    text: there you go
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '4536.8'
    text: um
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '4539.04'
    text: and this is a mesh it&amp;#39;s sort of like a
  - dur: '6.761'
    start: '4541.639'
    text: like a animation thing it&amp;#39;s not really
  - dur: '7.48'
    start: '4543.88'
    text: data it&amp;#39;s more just for eyeballs but
  - dur: '7.68'
    start: '4548.4'
    text: um this these are the rigid bodies so
  - dur: '7.359'
    start: '4551.36'
    text: these are the um this the
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '4556.08'
    text: the simplified sort of Chunk segments
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '4558.719'
    text: that we&amp;#39;re going to call those parts of
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '4560.52'
    text: my body and then this is my center of
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '4563.28'
    text: mass calculated with those anthropometry
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '4564.8'
    text: tables talked about PR prior um and so
  - dur: '3.199'
    start: '4568.96'
    text: and then this sort of
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '4570.6'
    text: red
  - dur: '6.721'
    start: '4572.159'
    text: line
  - dur: '7.601'
    start: '4574.239'
    text: here let&amp;#39;s make that pink yeah
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '4578.88'
    text: um this represents the vertical
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '4581.84'
    text: projection of that threedimensional
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '4585.08'
    text: point now you see the these terms like
  - dur: '5.881'
    start: '4587.239'
    text: vertical projection and it&amp;#39;s sounds very
  - dur: '6.16'

    text: vertical projection of that thing I just

    start: '4619'
    text: say x
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '4622.04'

  - dur: '5.041'

    text: projection of that I just set X I set
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '4626.36'

    text: that I care about why do I want to see
  - dur: '3.08'
    start: '4636.4'
    text: that it&amp;#39;s like well because I&amp;#39;m talking

    start: '4637.76'
    text: about balance whenever I talk about
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4639.48'
    text: balance I keep using these terms like
  - dur: '2.719'
    start: '4642.92'
    text: you know Center of mass and base of
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4644.52'
    text: support
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '4645.639'

    start: '4649.52'
    text: I&amp;#39;m C I&amp;#39;m not I don&amp;#39;t really want to I
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '4651.239'

  - dur: '4.599'

  - dur: '4.84'

  - dur: '4.361'

    text: the height at all I only care about its
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '4665.12'
    text: position on the ground plane so I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '4667.04'
    text: going to project it down onto the ground
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '4669.32'
    text: plane and I want to compare it to the
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '4671.8'
    text: base of support where what is the base
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '4673.92'
    text: of support here
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '4676.239'
    text: um there&amp;#39;s a thing that&amp;#39;s supposed to
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '4678.199'
    text: make it show up here but I I just can
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '4680.04'
    text: never make that work maybe next semester
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '4682.52'
    text: um but in here very intuitively the base
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '4685.239'
    text: of support is where my feet are it&amp;#39;s the
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '4688.8'
    text: extent of where my feet are behold my
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4691.639'
    text: base of support on the ground and so
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '4694.96'
    text: everywhere I can sort
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '4696.639'
    text: of yeah that&amp;#39;s where my feet go that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '4699.08'
    text: that&amp;#39;s the the the region of the ground
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '4701.52'
    text: where I can abser pressure and sort of
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '4704.44'
    text: change the forces to sort of affect my
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '4706.28'
    text: center of mass I can push it outside of
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '4708.36'
    text: my center of my base of support but when
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '4710.56'
    text: I do that I have to move my other foot
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '4714'
    text: or I will hit the deck um and for this
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '4717.04'
    text: task as we have defined it I told myself
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '4720.08'
    text: as a research participant that my goal
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '4722.44'
    text: was to lean without moving my feet so we
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '4725.4'
    text: can assume in this context that if my
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '4728.4'
    text: feet move then I have failed the task at
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '4731'
    text: hand and so we can assume that the the
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '4733.88'
    text: neural control that I&amp;#39;m exhibiting is in
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '4736.56'
    text: the service of completing that task so
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '4738.52'
    text: we&amp;#39;ve defined success and failure in
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '4740.159'
    text: this task again giving us a little bit
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '4742.96'
    text: more leverage to interpret this weird
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '4746.679'
    text: squiggly wiggly line here in terms of
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '4749'
    text: how it relates to things like balance
  - dur: '2.2'
    start: '4750.36'
    text: and
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4752.96'
    text: posture um and I&amp;#39;m going to
  - dur: '7.96'
    start: '4758.88'
    text: say I&amp;#39;m going to say 300
  - dur: '7.84'
    start: '4762.6'
    text: z uh update I&amp;#39;ll paths
  - dur: '8.76'
    start: '4766.84'
    text: great um so this the pink line now is
  - dur: '9.799'
    start: '4770.44'
    text: showing the um the
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '4775.6'
    text: previous 10 seconds that&amp;#39;s too
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '4780.88'
    text: many
  - dur: '7.2'
    start: '4783.36'
    text: bye going move his Bas of support no
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '4786.199'
    text: nervous system my&amp;#39;s fault
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '4791.36'
    text: um okay now I&amp;#39;m trying to I brought a
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '4795'
    text: mouse today because it&amp;#39;s hard enough to
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '4797.199'
    text: navigate these 3D spaces but with a
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '4798.92'
    text: trackpad it&amp;#39;s like Jesus Christ
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4802.32'
    text: um
  - dur: '6'
    start: '4805.76'
    text: so this is also so so I start out
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '4809.639'
    text: outside of the screen this is what we
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '4811.76'
    text: call invalid
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '4814.239'
    text: data this is not I didn&amp;#39;t do this you
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '4817.159'
    text: were all here if I did you would have
  - dur: '7.96'
    start: '4818.96'
    text: noticed but this is what it happens when
  - dur: '7.24'
    start: '4822.76'
    text: there&amp;#39;s nothing in the in the screen on
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '4826.92'
    text: the on the the the CSV thing this data
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '4830'
    text: looks just the same as the data where
  - dur: '7.601'
    start: '4832.239'
    text: it&amp;#39;s actually like a stick figure it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '9.64'
    start: '4834.88'
    text: just not real um and so I come in and I
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '4839.84'
    text: say oh yeah then it snaps on top of me
  - dur: '7.121'
    start: '4845.199'
    text: and let&amp;#39;s see
  - dur: '7.599'
    start: '4848.56'
    text: here and so here I am I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '4852.32'
    text: standing and leaning forward
  - dur: '6.361'
    start: '4856.159'
    text: and there&amp;#39;s something oh let&amp;#39;s do it
  - dur: '7.441'
    start: '4858.679'
    text: like that oh there we
  - dur: '6.199'
    start: '4862.52'
    text: go and so I&amp;#39;m leaning all the way over
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '4866.12'
    text: it&amp;#39;s a little bit outside so there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.241'
    start: '4868.719'
    text: another layer of this where I&amp;#39;m like
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '4870.36'
    text: there&amp;#39;s a calculation here of like
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '4871.96'
    text: figuring out how to orient myself on the
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '4873.6'
    text: ground which I don&amp;#39;t 100% trust so I
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '4875.28'
    text: don&amp;#39;t 100% trust these
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '4877.36'
    text: data um but theoretically the theory
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '4880.88'
    text: predicts that I should
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '4882.76'
    text: be right at the edge of my foot when I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '4885.56'
    text: leaning all the way this way um although
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '4889.88'
    text: again if we look at the data of what&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '4892.12'
    text: being traed on my
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '4894.28'
    text: feet it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.759'
    start: '4896.4'
    text: like okay but it&amp;#39;s a very very very
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '4899.88'
    text: impoverished model of the foot I have
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '4902.159'
    text: heel I have toe I don&amp;#39;t have this outer
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '4905'
    text: extent of my foot so even though I can
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '4909.199'
    text: put Force into the ground all the way
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4911.28'
    text: out to here the data that we has show of
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '4914.159'
    text: my foot as just being a thin line on the
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '4916.8'
    text: ground and furthermore because you know
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '4919.8'
    text: this was not really made to be like a
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '4921.36'
    text: scientific software those predictions
  - dur: '6.641'
    start: '4923.719'
    text: are going to be slightly different for
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4925.8'
    text: each of the viewpoints of the cameras so
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '4930.36'
    text: there&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '4931.32'
    text: whole layer upon layer of like how much
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4934'
    text: do you trust things like the the the
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '4936.239'
    text: very specific data about like where the
  - dur: '7.199'
    start: '4938'
    text: feet are versus the full body data of
  - dur: '7.44'
    start: '4940.199'
    text: where the body is um but you know
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '4945.199'
    text: we kind of it&amp;#39;s like close
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '4947.639'
    text: enough
  - dur: '6.281'
    start: '4950.159'
    text: um it&amp;#39;s also kind of hard because that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '4953.32'
    text: hard for a lot of reasons
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '4956.44'
    text: um
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '4958.56'
    text: okay so generally speaking when you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5.761'
    start: '4960.639'
    text: studying human behavior the harder the
  - dur: '5.881'
    start: '4963.239'
    text: task is the easier it is to interpret
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '4966.4'
    text: because the harder the task is the fewer
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4969.12'
    text: options are available that complete the
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '4972.12'
    text: task so if you assume that I can do the
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '4974.04'
    text: task then the harder it is the easier it
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '4976.32'
    text: is to interpret um so for example
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '4979.639'
    text: standing on two feet is easier than
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '4981.44'
    text: standing on one foot because of that the
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '4983.56'
    text: base of support is larger so making
  - dur: '3.119'
    start: '4985.56'
    text: predictions about where the center that
  - dur: '2.679'
    start: '4987.48'
    text: base of that Center of mass is going to
  - dur: '2.841'
    start: '4988.679'
    text: be within that base of support
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '4990.159'
    text: necessarily more difficult CU you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '4991.52'
    text: picking from a larger region uh when I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '4994.08'
    text: on one
  - dur: '6.399'
    start: '4995.32'
    text: foot the base of support is much smaller
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '4998.84'
    text: like this big and so the ability to
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '5001.719'
    text: predict if assuming that I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '5003.8'
    text: successfully standing on one foot the
  - dur: '3.401'
    start: '5006.159'
    text: ability to predict where the center mass
  - dur: '4.241'
    start: '5007.639'
    text: will be in this region is easier because
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '5009.56'
    text: it&amp;#39;s a smaller region and there&amp;#39;s just
  - dur: '4'
    start: '5011.88'
    text: there&amp;#39;s fewer things that I could be
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '5013.639'
    text: doing that would successfully complete
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '5015.88'
    text: the task because the task is harder and
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '5018.76'
    text: so in this case if we look here at this
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '5023'
    text: sort of nice moment where I&amp;#39;m standing
  - dur: '5.239'
    start: '5024.48'
    text: 'on'
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '5026.36'
    text: my right foot and you look at that
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '5029.719'
    text: vertical projection of the center of
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '5031.04'
    text: mass let&amp;#39;s see so here
  - dur: '3.08'
    start: '5039.52'
    text: okay so
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '5040.56'
    text: '11:37'
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '5042.6'
    text: 11:37 so from frame 1137 rice picked up
  - dur: '2.199'
    start: '5046.48'
    text: my
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '5052.84'
    text: foot to let&amp;#39;s say
  - dur: '5.761'
    start: '5057.719'
    text: '2058'
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '5059.44'
    text: uh so for these thousand frames I am
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '5063.48'
    text: standing
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '5064.96'
    text: over my right foot and what do you know
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '5067.52'
    text: the vertical projection is right over my
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '5070.52'
    text: right
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '5071.44'
    text: foot hooray science Works physics Works

    start: '5075.4'
    text: mechanics are true you
  - dur: '4.759'
    start: '5077.92'
    text: can this isn&amp;#39;t enough to tell me about
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '5080.52'
    text: like my hip torqus like the center of

    text: Mass on its own isn&amp;#39;t going to tell me
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '5083.88'
    text: about things like my hip torque or my
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '5085.84'
    text: knee flexion and stuff like that but in
  - dur: '4'
    start: '5088.56'
    text: terms of like the base level task of am
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '5090.52'
    text: I keeping my foot in the right location
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '5092.56'
    text: relative to my body to keep up right
  - dur: '6.721'
    start: '5095.159'
    text: sure enough am and there we go and you
  - dur: '8.36'
    start: '5098.44'
    text: can see again this is sort of like easy
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '5101.88'
    text: to belittle or easy to sort of not like
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '5106.8'
    text: like this is cool this is a cool thing
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '5108.48'
    text: just so you know this is very cool and
  - dur: '7.84'
    start: '5110.96'
    text: uh and I&amp;#39;m proud of it so you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '8.6'
    start: '5114.84'
    text: welcome uh sorry sorry I said
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '5118.8'
    text: that um okay so base standing posture we
  - dur: '4'
    start: '5123.44'
    text: could look at the left fo foot but I
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '5124.92'
    text: don&amp;#39;t really we&amp;#39;re running out of time
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '5127.44'
    text: very quickly and let&amp;#39;s assume for
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '5131.08'
    text: practical purposes that the left side of
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '5132.719'
    text: my body and the right side of my body
  - dur: '4.759'
    start: '5134.36'
    text: are similar enough that we don&amp;#39;t have to
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '5137.239'
    text: care about the left side versus the
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '5139.119'
    text: right side um that&amp;#39;s not true because
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '5142.719'
    text: there&amp;#39;s handedness and footedness and
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '5144.44'
    text: I&amp;#39;m I think I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m better on my right
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '5146.76'
    text: foot than I am on my left foot or vice
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '5148.6'
    text: versa I can&amp;#39;t remember um but for the
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '5150.8'
    text: sake of expedience this is what it looks
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '5153.159'
    text: like when I&amp;#39;m standing under my own
  - dur: '6.88'
    start: '5154.96'
    text: powers and my own sort of like
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '5157.52'
    text: anatomical base of support
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '5162.119'
    text: So prediction wise um how might this
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '5166.08'
    text: change is if if I&amp;#39;m holding something
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '5168.719'
    text: additional like something else outside
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '5170.32'
    text: of my body well you can ask the question
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '5173.44'
    text: what aspects of the description of this
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '5176.199'
    text: this physical model no longer apply when
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '5180.4'
    text: there&amp;#39;s something that I&amp;#39;m touching
  - dur: '6.561'
    start: '5181.719'
    text: that&amp;#39;s outside of my body
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '5186.04'
    text: so there&amp;#39;s a lot of things one of them
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '5188.28'
    text: is that first thing that I said where my
  - dur: '5.721'
    start: '5190.639'
    text: ability to put Force into the world to
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '5193.4'
    text: move my body is constrained to that
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '5196.36'
    text: where my feet are when I&amp;#39;m standing on
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '5198.48'
    text: the ground like this that my basis
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '5200.719'
    text: support is defined by my feet because
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '5202.36'
    text: that&amp;#39;s where I can put Force that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '5205.199'
    text: Newton&amp;#39;s third law for every I put
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '5207.199'
    text: action in the world the world does a
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '5208.8'
    text: reaction pushes me back in this context
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '5211.119'
    text: that&amp;#39;s called the ground reaction force
  - dur: '8.121'
    start: '5212.719'
    text: which is very very use useful you you
  - dur: '8'
    start: '5215.679'
    text: use it every day um and so and so I say
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '5220.84'
    text: because of that constraint on my ability
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '5223.679'
    text: to put Force into the world sort of
  - dur: '5'
    start: '5225.199'
    text: being attached to where my feet are um
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '5228.04'
    text: in order for me to stay upright I have
  - dur: '3'
    start: '5230.199'
    text: to keep my center of mass above the base
  - dur: '6.721'
    start: '5232.199'
    text: of
  - dur: '8.081'
    start: '5233.199'
    text: support um if now I&amp;#39;m touching something
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '5238.92'
    text: else that thing that I just said is no
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '5241.28'
    text: longer true I can now get Force in
  - dur: '6.279'
    start: '5244.4'
    text: reaction force from the table which is
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '5248'
    text: not noticeably where my foot is and also
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '5250.679'
    text: in this data recording I have no record
  - dur: '3.881'
    start: '5253.119'
    text: of where the table was so if I&amp;#39;m looking
  - dur: '3.04'
    start: '5255.32'
    text: at this I can&amp;#39;t make that same
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '5257'
    text: prediction about where the center of
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '5258.36'
    text: mass would be I can make a prediction
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '5261.6'
    text: about which direction I&amp;#39;m allowed to go
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '5264.719'
    text: out of that base of support from and
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '5267.08'
    text: which direction would require me to to
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '5269.639'
    text: fall
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '5270.719'
    text: over um real quick I&amp;#39;ll just say it
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '5274.239'
    text: though I don&amp;#39;t have any time uh 2015
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '5277.239'
    text: they they had a DARPA robotics challenge
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '5279.48'
    text: bunch of bipeds walking around and they
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '5281.04'
    text: did sort of hilariously bad but it was
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '5283.119'
    text: still a big advance for the field um one
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '5286.36'
    text: of the things that they really struggled
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '5287.84'
    text: with was was calculating the reaction
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '5290.48'
    text: forces because they had really good
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '5293.28'
    text: sensors on the ground um but they didn&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '5296.04'
    text: have good sensors elsewhere so there was
  - dur: '3.119'
    start: '5298.04'
    text: at least one case where one of the
  - dur: '3.161'
    start: '5299.679'
    text: robots was like standing in a doorway
  - dur: '3.201'
    start: '5301.159'
    text: trying to figure out what to do and
  - dur: '2.64'
    start: '5302.84'
    text: they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re calculating the force it
  - dur: '3.359'
    start: '5304.36'
    text: needs to put to sort of move in the
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '5305.48'
    text: right direction and they didn&amp;#39;t realize
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '5307.719'
    text: that its arm was touching the door frame
  - dur: '3'
    start: '5310.36'
    text: and so when they&amp;#39;re calculating the
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '5311.56'
    text: forces that it needed they weren&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '5313.36'
    text: accounting for this force and so then
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '5316.639'
    text: when they tried to sort of make the
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '5318.6'
    text: right step it like it fell over and then
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '5322'
    text: had like a a a balanc response which was
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '5324.92'
    text: also wrong because that also didn&amp;#39;t have
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '5326.8'
    text: this calculated into it and then if you
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '5328.719'
    text: just Google 2015 darer robotics
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '5330.4'
    text: challenges there&amp;#39;s a lot of like really
  - dur: '7.4'
    start: '5333.52'
    text: great blue reels of bipeds falling over
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '5337.04'
    text: dramatically and reminding us how how
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '5340.92'
    text: powerful of a motor you need to move
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '5343.28'
    text: something with such an incredible
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '5345.36'
    text: mechanical
  - dur: '3'
    start: '5346.76'
    text: disadvantage
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '5349.88'
    text: anyway uh 3 minutes not enough
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '5353.639'
    text: time um but we&amp;#39;ll do it
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '5356.52'
    text: anyways real
  - dur: '6.719'
    start: '5358.48'
    text: quick hopefully we can get this
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '5362.28'
    text: in um
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '5365.199'
    text: yeah Center of Mass sorry uh standing
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '5367.84'
    text: supported so this is
  - dur: '7.161'
    start: '5371.719'
    text: now the other
  - dur: '9.56'
    start: '5374'
    text: recording um same basic
  - dur: '8.6'
    start: '5378.88'
    text: structure uh except now I am holding
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '5383.56'
    text: this stick and I&amp;#39;m holding it on my well
  - dur: '7.28'
    start: '5387.48'
    text: let&amp;#39;s see where I&amp;#39;m holding
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '5389.88'
    text: it I think it was on my right hand
  - dur: '10.12'
    start: '5396.8'
    text: and yeah so my right hand
  - dur: '10.92'
    start: '5400.48'
    text: so I do I hide you I hide you I say I do
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '5406.92'
    text: this yes and I grab I don&amp;#39;t think we
  - dur: '4.759'
    start: '5411.4'
    text: need the
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '5412.36'
    text: Tails um and so now we should be able to
  - dur: '2.641'
    start: '5416.159'
    text: make a nice
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '5419.199'
    text: prediction especially because I was
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '5421.8'
    text: there we go
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '5424.44'
    text: so let&amp;#39;s see
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '5425.639'
    text: '1182'
  - dur: '3'
    start: '5427.88'
    text: '1182'
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '5431.84'
    text: to oh actually I do want
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '5434.48'
    text: that about
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '5438.92'
    text: 2,000 and I do want to
  - dur: '9.6'
    start: '5448.119'
    text: put okay round
  - dur: '10.08'
    start: '5451.4'
    text: frame uh 50 500 before zero after
  - dur: '3.761'
    start: '5457.719'
    text: calculate the whole
  - dur: '7.159'
    start: '5462.04'
    text: thing and
  - dur: '7.281'
    start: '5465.199'
    text: display no key frames color is going to
  - dur: '8'
    start: '5469.199'
    text: be green
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '5472.48'
    text: great and what do you know sure
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '5478.36'
    text: enough it&amp;#39;s on the outside of the foot
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '5482.48'
    text: so understandably before we said this
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '5484.96'
    text: it&amp;#39;s like oh we don&amp;#39;t really trust the
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '5486.44'
    text: locations of the foot to this high of
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '5488.28'
    text: level of fidelity which is a fair point
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '5490.96'
    text: but we also saw in that control
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '5493'
    text: condition that when I&amp;#39;m standing on one
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '5495.119'
    text: foot it&amp;#39;s pretty close to that like line
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '5498.76'
    text: between the heel and the toe and now
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '5501.28'
    text: that I have this unmeasured balance
  - dur: '7.56'
    start: '5504.48'
    text: Support over here my actual base of
  - dur: '7'
    start: '5507.119'
    text: support is no longer foot it&amp;#39;s foot plus
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '5512.04'
    text: little balance point over there and the
  - dur: '6.961'
    start: '5514.119'
    text: reality is is that like you know I weigh
  - dur: '6.601'
    start: '5516.679'
    text: like 200ish PBS of of person that&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '4'
    start: '5521.08'
    text: lot of force I can&amp;#39;t really put an
  - dur: '5'
    start: '5523.28'
    text: appreciable percentage of that Force
  - dur: '7.079'
    start: '5525.08'
    text: into that little little we weenie stick
  - dur: '6.8'
    start: '5528.28'
    text: um so it&amp;#39;s not like the the the point is
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '5532.159'
    text: as good as the foot but mathematically I
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '5535.08'
    text: can pull some force from this direction
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '5538.239'
    text: so my my actual effective Bas of support
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '5540.679'
    text: is going to extend outside of my foot in
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '5542.639'
    text: the direction of that
  - dur: '3'
    start: '5544.88'
    text: support
  - dur: '10.76'
    start: '5549.56'
    text: uh and there you go empirical
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '5554.44'
    text: measurement result on the fly in person
  - dur: '7.6'
    start: '5560.36'
    text: hooray
  - dur: '9.56'
    start: '5562.96'
    text: and yeah okay
  - dur: '7.44'
    start: '5567.96'
    text: that&amp;#39;s yeah cool feel good about that
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '5572.52'
    text: very close timing uh um we&amp;#39;ll probably
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '5575.4'
    text: talk about this just a touch more on
  - dur: '6.319'
    start: '5577.32'
    text: next Wednesday and then we&amp;#39;ll do that uh
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '5579.8'
    text: that work that group thing um keep an
  - dur: '2.921'
    start: '5583.639'
    text: eye on the Discord server if I announce
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '5585.04'
    text: anything but I probably won&amp;#39;t before
  - dur: '7.36'
    start: '5586.56'
    text: Wednesday so thank you enjoy the rest of
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '5589'
    text: your lives thank you bye

    text: okay hello everybody and welcome to
  - dur: '7.68'
    start: '7.4'
    text: Wednesday um so today is a very special
  - dur: '6.361'
    start: '11.559'
    text: day um because today we&amp;#39;re going to do
  - dur: '5.439'
    start: '15.08'
    text: some data collection which is always a
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '17.92'
    text: very exciting time in any scientist&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.881'
    start: '20.519'
    text: life when you you you get some numbers
  - dur: '6.199'
    start: '24.4'
    text: you take some recordings and
  - dur: '8.04'
    start: '26.4'
    text: then often times you spend the next like
  - dur: '5.441'
    start: '30.599'
    text: while uh analyzing that data so how it
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '34.44'
    text: goes matters a lot this is not a
  - dur: '6.92'
    start: '36.04'
    text: particularly High uh high stakes
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '38.84'
    text: situation but yeah it&amp;#39;ll be fun so we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '42.96'
    text: going to do I&amp;#39;m going to try to like
  - dur: '6'
    start: '45.28'
    text: finish up what I was talking about last
  - dur: '9.48'
    start: '47.52'
    text: time and then I&amp;#39;m going to set up the
  - dur: '7.84'
    start: '51.28'
    text: cameras and uh do a quick recording do a
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '57'
    text: couple of quick recordings with the free
  - dur: '7.999'
    start: '59.12'
    text: moap softare which I made with my lab
  - dur: '7.6'
    start: '61.92'
    text: over the past six years or so um and
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '67.119'
    text: then if if all goes well it should pop
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '69.52'
    text: something out that&amp;#39;s worth looking at
  - dur: '9.521'
    start: '71.159'
    text: today um and then I will do some
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '76.56'
    text: additional fiddling with it and I either
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '80.68'
    text: have something to say about that on
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '82.4'
    text: Monday or wait and give myself an extra
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '85.88'
    text: bit of time and talk about that on
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '87.759'
    text: Wednesday um so if you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '91.6'
    text: not
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '93.439'
    text: yeah your job is mostly to just sit and
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '96.32'
    text: listen and try not to fall asleep but if
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '98.28'
    text: you fall asleep I understand you&amp;#39;re you
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '100.439'
    text: got a lot going on
  - dur: '7.92'
    start: '104.159'
    text: um
  - dur: '10.159'
    start: '106'
    text: so Behold a human person it is roughly
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '112.079'
    text: speaking this shape
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '116.159'
    text: see
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '117.68'
    text: uh this is a complicated shap
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '120.719'
    text: but it&amp;#39;s not nearly as complicated as
  - dur: '5.481'
    start: '122.399'
    text: this weird object um but if we needed to
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '125.56'
    text: because we are finite beings with finite
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '127.88'
    text: technology in finite time if we wanted
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '130.399'
    text: to study this complicated object this
  - dur: '5.559'
    start: '133.76'
    text: the desidera of our research being to
  - dur: '6.8'
    start: '136.56'
    text: understand how humans move through the
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '139.319'
    text: world eight um you have to make
  - dur: '2.36'
    start: '143.36'
    text: simplifications you have to make
  - dur: '6.68'
    start: '144.44'
    text: assumptions you have to do things like
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '145.72'
    text: that and so last time I talked about
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '152.64'
    text: can I do
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '157.2'
    text: this that works so last time I talked
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '160.159'
    text: about my personal favorite uh
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '161.92'
    text: oversimplification of a complex physical
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '164.12'
    text: object which is to take that object and
  - dur: '5.959'
    start: '167'
    text: reduce it down to a single point mass
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '169.44'
    text: that we call the center of Mass center
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '172.959'
    text: of mass we often hear it called like
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '174.64'
    text: center of gravity um which in that term
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '178.8'
    text: in that meaning
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '180.56'
    text: uh gravity is sort of meant in like the
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '181.959'
    text: old school sense of like density uh
  - dur: '8.121'
    start: '184.159'
    text: because density and mass are kind of the
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '186.36'
    text: same thing in some conceptions um but
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '192.28'
    text: the the beauty of the center mass is
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '193.4'
    text: that it&amp;#39;s a rather simple thing um the
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '195.56'
    text: center of mass is the the concept of
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '197.28'
    text: Center Mass is the thing that&amp;#39;s the
  - dur: '4.519'
    start: '199.28'
    text: intuition that says that if I want to
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '200.64'
    text: balance this stick on my finger I put my
  - dur: '2.881'
    start: '203.799'
    text: finger
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '207.72'
    text: under two fingers
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '210.28'
    text: under the midpoint of the the Total
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '212.64'
    text: distribution of Mass on the thing and it
  - dur: '4'
    start: '214.599'
    text: balances there because there&amp;#39;s the same
  - dur: '4.479'
    start: '216.68'
    text: amount of pull on this side as there is
  - dur: '5'
    start: '218.599'
    text: on that side and if it&amp;#39;s a symmetric
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '221.159'
    text: object the center of mass corresponds to
  - dur: '5.481'
    start: '223.599'
    text: the geometric center of the object
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '226.04'
    text: itself if it is
  - dur: '7.439'
    start: '229.08'
    text: non that&amp;#39;s the wrong direction oh I did
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '232.12'
    text: that whoops
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '237.28'
    text: um uh what am I trying to do I&amp;#39;m trying
  - dur: '2.36'
    start: '239.36'
    text: to do that
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '243.04'
    text: if the weight is
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '244.799'
    text: non-symmetrically um so linguistically
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '247.56'
    text: it we tend to like interchange mass and
  - dur: '5.041'
    start: '249.879'
    text: weight language wise um in imperial
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '252.92'
    text: units we actually don&amp;#39;t have a dedicated
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '254.92'
    text: measure for Mass we just use pounds
  - dur: '3.319'
    start: '257.44'
    text: which is actually a measure of weight
  - dur: '2.84'
    start: '259.32'
    text: weight is a measure of force it&amp;#39;s like
  - dur: '3.401'
    start: '260.759'
    text: how much force am I putting into the
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '262.16'
    text: ground so if you assume that gravity
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '264.16'
    text: isn&amp;#39;t changing mass and weight are
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '266.24'
    text: interchangeable but just because I spent
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '268.72'
    text: like an hour and a half last week for on
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '271.12'
    text: Monday talking about SI units I should
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '274.039'
    text: specify
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '275.24'
    text: that when I say weight I typically mean
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '278.08'
    text: mass in vice versa uh but until we go to
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '281.28'
    text: the Moon that won&amp;#39;t be a problem anyways
  - dur: '5.521'
    start: '283.759'
    text: Center of mass when the weight is non
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '286.6'
    text: the mass is non uniformly distributed
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '289.28'
    text: the center of mass is not going to be
  - dur: '6.081'
    start: '292.479'
    text: the same as the geometric center of the
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '295.639'
    text: object but the same basic idea maintains
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '298.56'
    text: like there is as much mass on this side
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '301'
    text: of the base of support which is this as
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '304.32'
    text: there is on that side and so the center
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '305.96'
    text: of mass of the thing is right around
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '309.36'
    text: here and so if I wanted to hold this
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '311.44'
    text: object off of the ground sta I I need
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '314.6'
    text: the base of support to be under the
  - dur: '5.441'
    start: '316.639'
    text: center of mass of the object itself if I
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '319.24'
    text: put the center of base of support
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '322.08'
    text: outside of the center of mass it&amp;#39;ll fall
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '323.88'
    text: in that direction which is not
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '325.8'
    text: particularly mind-blowing but it is an
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '329.08'
    text: app description of what balance is at a
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '331.36'
    text: very s of low level of
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '333.639'
    text: physics
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '336.12'
    text: um have a let make sure we have enough
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '338.72'
    text: time to sort of say all the things I
  - dur: '7.88'
    start: '340.759'
    text: want to say uh should be fine
  - dur: '7.6'
    start: '345.28'
    text: um so last time we also talked
  - dur: '6.68'
    start: '348.639'
    text: about any balls here I didn&amp;#39;t bring me
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '352.88'
    text: um when an object is flying through the
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '355.319'
    text: air it has this nice ballistic
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '358.28'
    text: trajectory
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '360.199'
    text: which is caused by the transduction and
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '362.72'
    text: exchange between kinetic and potential
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '364.88'
    text: energy in a gravity well and there&amp;#39;s MGH
  - dur: '4.481'
    start: '368.319'
    text: is potential energy 1 12 mv^ s is
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '370.44'
    text: kinetic energy
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '372.8'
    text: and even though this object is
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '375.28'
    text: complicated in its form the trajectory
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '378.28'
    text: that it takes in the air is exactly the
  - dur: '5.881'
    start: '380.639'
    text: same as it would be if if I was throwing
  - dur: '4.481'
    start: '383.319'
    text: an equivalent mass in a like if if this
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '386.52'
    text: if you condense this down to like a
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '387.8'
    text: single lead sphere and I toss it in the
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '390.599'
    text: air it would follow the same trajectory
  - dur: '6.201'
    start: '392.599'
    text: if I spin it it spins around its Center
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '396'
    text: of mass because it&amp;#39;s in a when it&amp;#39;s not
  - dur: '3.08'
    start: '398.8'
    text: when it doesn&amp;#39;t have anything to push
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '399.88'
    text: off against you don&amp;#39;t have any there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '401.88'
    text: nothing to react there no re no re no
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '404.84'
    text: reaction force to push you in any
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '407.36'
    text: direction things balance out and you get
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '411.36'
    text: sort of simple predictable physical
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '413.88'
    text: behavior
  - dur: '5.801'
    start: '416.759'
    text: um we also talked very briefly
  - dur: '7.119'
    start: '420.52'
    text: about one of my favorite things which is
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '422.56'
    text: pendul pendulums pendulums pendul which
  - dur: '4.521'
    start: '427.639'
    text: this is an example of a pendulum you&amp;#39;ve
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '429.28'
    text: seen them in various places of your life
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '432.16'
    text: and it&amp;#39;s basically a mass hanging below
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '434.84'
    text: a standard pendulum is a mass hanging
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '437.039'
    text: below a pivot point and if
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '440.44'
    text: without you know if you pull it back and
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '442.68'
    text: then let it go it&amp;#39;ll swing back and
  - dur: '5.481'
    start: '444.879'
    text: forth for quite some time until
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '448.039'
    text: friction bleeds off enough energy that
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '450.36'
    text: it will eventually slow down and the
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '452.16'
    text: reason for that sort of
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '455.44'
    text: conservative
  - dur: '5'
    start: '457.72'
    text: motion is the same kind of transduction
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '460.479'
    text: between potential and kinetic energy so
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '462.72'
    text: if you imagine that&amp;#39;s a pivot
  - dur: '7.039'
    start: '465.84'
    text: point that&amp;#39;s the the Bob the mass of the
  - dur: '5.519'
    start: '468.96'
    text: pendulum let&amp;#39;s assume that this string
  - dur: '2.681'
    start: '472.879'
    text: doesn&amp;#39;t weigh anything or at the very
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '474.479'
    text: least it
  - dur: '5.919'
    start: '475.56'
    text: weighs much much much less than this if
  - dur: '6.401'
    start: '478.879'
    text: we wanted to we could also just imagine
  - dur: '6'
    start: '481.479'
    text: that if it&amp;#39;s shaped if this is the shape
  - dur: '4'
    start: '485.28'
    text: you know the center of mass of the thing
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '487.479'
    text: is still going to be definable
  - dur: '7.199'
    start: '489.28'
    text: mathematically in some place there
  - dur: '8.2'
    start: '492.24'
    text: um but here it is up here and then we
  - dur: '7.801'
    start: '496.479'
    text: let it go it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s up here at rest so
  - dur: '7.439'
    start: '500.44'
    text: it&amp;#39;s kinetic energy equals zero and its
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '504.28'
    text: potential energy is at let&amp;#39;s just say
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '507.879'
    text: it&amp;#39;s Max and then so we let it go and it
  - dur: '4.479'
    start: '511.12'
    text: drops and then it gets to this point
  - dur: '6.161'

  - dur: '4.719'

  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '577.2'
    text: always going to be things like air
  - dur: '4.68'

    text: resistance that will be bleeding off
  - dur: '5.16'

    start: '582.92'
    text: if we if we plot it over time and we

  - dur: '7.32'
    start: '592.519'
    text: it&amp;#39;ll go like this and then it will

    start: '595.68'
    text: slowly we call that damping out if it
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '599.839'
    text: was a ideal system this would just be
  - dur: '3.721'
    start: '603.079'
    text: like a nice sine wave forever but
  - dur: '3.161'
    start: '605.519'
    text: because there&amp;#39;s going to be some bleed
  - dur: '5'
    start: '606.8'
    text: due to friction this will be the nice
  - dur: '7.44'
    start: '608.68'
    text: trajectory there so that is
  - dur: '9.8'
    start: '611.8'
    text: a this is what a a standard hanging
  - dur: '7.64'
    start: '616.12'
    text: pendulum and look at it go pendula are
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '621.6'
    text: very very very very important in the
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '623.76'
    text: history of science they are sort of part
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '625.56'
    text: of almost every important measurement in
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '628.36'
    text: history um like gravitational constants
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '631.16'
    text: you know Electro kolum Force um
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '634.88'
    text: apparently there was a time when they
  - dur: '5.961'
    start: '636.279'
    text: used to use the period of a pendulum to
  - dur: '5.961'
    start: '639.079'
    text: do prospecting for iron ore because you
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '642.24'
    text: can measure the D like the the period of
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '645.04'
    text: a pendulum very very accurately and it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '647.92'
    text: going to be defined by the density it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '650.639'
    text: like the gravitational constant the
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '652.32'
    text: gravitational force is a part of that uh
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '655.399'
    text: equation of motion so apparently they
  - dur: '6.401'
    start: '657.399'
    text: would just like move these very very
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '660.16'
    text: very precise pendula over parts of the
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '663.8'
    text: ground where they thought there might be
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '664.959'
    text: iron ore and then if they measured a
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '667.04'
    text: change in the period that&amp;#39;s an that&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '669.399'
    text: reason to believe that there&amp;#39;s a higher
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '670.88'
    text: density in the column between you and
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '672.839'
    text: the center of the earth this is I read
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '675.079'
    text: about this in a book I had a hard time
  - dur: '7.161'
    start: '677.639'
    text: validating verifying that information
  - dur: '9.199'
    start: '680.44'
    text: but nonetheless it&amp;#39;s very it&amp;#39;s a pendula
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '684.8'
    text: pendulums very good stuff um
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '689.639'
    text: pendulums are also a nice example of
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '691.2'
    text: like that periodic motion I mentioned
  - dur: '5'
    start: '693.279'
    text: briefly last time how we think about
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '695.399'
    text: time there&amp;#39;s like the the there&amp;#39;s like
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '698.279'
    text: stopwatch time which always counts up
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '700.16'
    text: but then there&amp;#39;s kind of like wall clock
  - dur: '6.281'
    start: '701.839'
    text: time that resets every so often and with
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '704.519'
    text: something like an oscillator like this
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '708.12'
    text: you sort of you&amp;#39;re thinking in that
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '709.36'
    text: phasic sort of like time you know goes
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '711.959'
    text: from zero to some Maximum and then it
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '714.399'
    text: like resets and then that&amp;#39;s we call that
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '716.24'
    text: a full cycle many many parts of biology
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '719.24'
    text: ology have this kind of like phasic
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '721.079'
    text: behavior um a lot of my research
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '723.399'
    text: historically has been on Locomotion and
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '725.639'
    text: that has a lot of pendulums in it um the
  - dur: '4.039'
    start: '728.24'
    text: main one that you would think about with
  - dur: '3.719'
    start: '729.48'
    text: the pendulum is like The Swinging leg um
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '732.279'
    text: but there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '7.08'
    start: '733.199'
    text: another much more dramatic and Central
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '737.56'
    text: pendulum which is the inverted pendulum
  - dur: '5.521'
    start: '740.279'
    text: of your sort of standing body so this is
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '743.399'
    text: a pendulum hanging from a a central
  - dur: '7.52'
    start: '745.8'
    text: Pivot Point um but but you could lift
  - dur: '7.641'
    start: '750.519'
    text: this thing up until it&amp;#39;s all the way on
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '753.32'
    text: top and then have it be up here as an
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '758.16'
    text: inverted
  - dur: '7.121'
    start: '759.199'
    text: pendulum and at this place uh so at the
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '763.12'
    text: bottom here this is a stable point
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '766.32'
    text: because if we just let it run this is
  - dur: '5.521'
    start: '768.079'
    text: where it will wind up this is in the
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '770.76'
    text: language of dynamical systems um this is
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '773.6'
    text: called an unstable point because
  - dur: '7.521'
    start: '775.839'
    text: technically speaking if you placed this
  - dur: '7.2'
    start: '779.48'
    text: here precisely at you know the angle of
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '783.36'
    text: deflection equals zero this would stay
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '786.68'
    text: it&amp;#39;s it would sort of stand up in the
  - dur: '8.16'
    start: '789'
    text: same way that this marker stands up on
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '792.6'
    text: the desk um but the reality but because
  - dur: '4.039'
    start: '797.16'
    text: this is an unstable point a any
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '799.24'
    text: perturbation from to the left or the
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '801.199'
    text: right is going to cause it like if you
  - dur: '3.281'
    start: '804.399'
    text: if this is not perfectly straight if
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '806'
    text: it&amp;#39;s a little bit
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '807.68'
    text: off to the right right then gravity is
  - dur: '2.519'
    start: '811.68'
    text: going to pull it down and then it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '812.76'
    text: going to keep pulling it down until it
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '814.199'
    text: falls down there so you
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '817.8'
    text: can
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '819.44'
    text: balance a a p so you can hang a pendulum
  - dur: '3.2'
    start: '823.12'
    text: and it&amp;#39;s passively stable gravity does
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '825.16'
    text: all the work for you you don&amp;#39;t have to
  - dur: '7.28'
    start: '826.32'
    text: worry about it um if you have if the
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '830.959'
    text: pendulum has if the base of support has
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '833.6'
    text: extent if it&amp;#39;s nonzero base of support
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '836.399'
    text: you can balance it happily on a flat
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '838.72'
    text: surface and it will also stay there
  - dur: '6.159'
    start: '840.24'
    text: passively forever um but if it&amp;#39;s if it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '844.32'
    text: not then you can balance it you then the
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '846.399'
    text: only way that you can balance it upright
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '849.04'
    text: is if you are actively controlling it so
  - dur: '3.359'
    start: '851.16'
    text: this is the classic like boom broom
  - dur: '4'
    start: '852.88'
    text: trick where you can just like balance
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '854.519'
    text: something on your hand and you can do it
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '856.88'
    text: because I&amp;#39;m moving around the base of
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '859.44'
    text: support to make sure that the that the
  - dur: '7.599'
    start: '861.68'
    text: whole thing never Falls over but I
  - dur: '4'
    start: '865.279'
    text: can&amp;#39;t so
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '876.12'
    text: this is all by way of preamble to the
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '879.399'
    text: recordings we&amp;#39;re about to
  - dur: '6.839'
    start: '882'
    text: do so if you think
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '884.6'
    text: about in some idealized pendulum and
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '888.839'
    text: this is the center of Mass on top of
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '891.16'
    text: it uh remember we&amp;#39;re spending a lot of
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '894.24'
    text: time thinking
  - dur: '3.721'
    start: '896.279'
    text: about Force equals mass time
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '898.44'
    text: acceleration
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '900'
    text: um where this is the
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '902.24'
    text: mass which we&amp;#39;re assuming the mass
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '904.36'
    text: doesn&amp;#39;t change so we can sort of assume
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '906.8'
    text: that Force
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '907.959'
    text: equals acceleration some approximation
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '912'
    text: um and so if
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '914.199'
    text: you&amp;#39;re you know in the idealized form
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '916.32'
    text: you manag to standing up here if the
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '920.759'
    text: projection of the center of mass onto
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '922.92'
    text: the floor if the distance from that
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '925.72'
    text: projection from this infimal base of
  - dur: '6.279'
    start: '928.48'
    text: support is zero then it&amp;#39;ll be happily
  - dur: '7.6'
    start: '930.56'
    text: standing ight forever um if
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '934.759'
    text: instead we&amp;#39;re off by a little bit and
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '938.16'
    text: the projection of the center of
  - dur: '7.56'
    start: '940.639'
    text: mass has a distance here from the base
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '944.68'
    text: of support then in a very intuitive
  - dur: '6.801'
    start: '948.199'
    text: sense that gravity pulls things down
  - dur: '8.96'
    start: '950.72'
    text: Gravely pulling like that and then this
  - dur: '6.319'
    start: '955'
    text: distance there will be sort of P pushing
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '959.68'
    text: the object away so that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '961.319'
    text: unstable because any deflection from
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '963.72'
    text: zero and it will start to fall and the
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '966.56'
    text: farther that it
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '968.519'
    text: falls the more it gets pushed away so
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '971.48'
    text: it&amp;#39;ll be accelerating away from that
  - dur: '3.239'
    start: '973.6'
    text: sort of stable
  - dur: '5.441'
    start: '975.279'
    text: Point
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '976.839'
    text: um and so if I&amp;#39;m if you&amp;#39;re supporting it
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '980.72'
    text: like the broom then you can make you can
  - dur: '6.241'
    start: '983.199'
    text: fix that by moving around the base of
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '986.92'
    text: support
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '989.44'
    text: on the
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '990.36'
    text: ground um but if you yourself are the
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '993.279'
    text: pendulum in question and you are you
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '996.04'
    text: know imagine my center of mass is here
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '999.319'
    text: and I&amp;#39;m standing on my one little leg if
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '1002.399'
    text: I I
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '1004.16'
    text: can um the only way that I can really
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1007'
    text: have any control over where my body is
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '1009.48'
    text: is by the forces that I&amp;#39;m putting into
  - dur: '8.04'
    start: '1011'
    text: the ground to my foot
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '1014.399'
    text: um so if we now imagine
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '1019.12'
    text: that&amp;#39;s

    text: hearing someone talk about
  - dur: '6'

    text: biomechanics um but if you think about
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '1116.32'
    text: sort of like zoom out a little bit from
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1118.88'
    text: those low-level physics and start
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1120.76'
    text: thinking instead about the you know
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '1123.64'

    text: neurons and sensory systems and stuff
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '1134.159'

  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '1137.6'
    text: the questions from the sort of
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '1138.88'
    text: neuroscience perspective of how does all
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '1141.2'
    text: of that sort of play out
  - dur: '5.64'

    text: in a a human person with things like

    start: '1147.6'
    text: joints and muscles and stuff like that
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '1149.76'
    text: so how do I if I&amp;#39;m if I&amp;#39;m because we&amp;#39;re

    text: out there are birds and most of them fly
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '1176.08'
    text: um the ground birds are arguably better
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1179.32'
    text: bipeds than we are because they have
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '1181.36'
    text: like 450 million years of evolution on
  - dur: '5.719'

    text: when they&amp;#39;re moving they can bounce on

  - dur: '5.161'

    text: in place they sort of you know crawl
  - dur: '8'
    start: '1218.799'
    text: around on four feet and they use their
  - dur: '7.719'
    start: '1221.32'
    text: tails um animals like uh like bears and
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '1226.799'
    text: apes and stuff like that can walk on two
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '1229.039'

    text: Walkers um we are I believe I&amp;#39;m always
  - dur: '2.4'

    text: like waiting to be find a counter
  - dur: '2.12'
    start: '1236.28'
    text: example but at this point I should
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '1237.36'
    text: probably just accept that there aren&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '1238.4'
    text: any uh we&amp;#39;re like the only obligate
  - dur: '3.84'

    text: bipeds in the Maman Kingdom where
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '1242.52'
    text: obligate bipad means like we really
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1244.48'
    text: don&amp;#39;t have like another option here like
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '1245.88'
    text: we it&amp;#39;s bip or nothing um and we are
  - dur: '6'
    start: '1249.24'
    text: also as far as they can figure out the
  - dur: '6.959'
    start: '1251.2'
    text: only animal that has two of the main
  - dur: '6.679'
    start: '1255.24'
    text: limbs of the sort of tetrapod this is
  - dur: '7.76'
    start: '1258.159'
    text: tetrapod pod shape head two limbs on top
  - dur: '6.361'
    start: '1261.919'
    text: two limbs on bottom and and a spine um
  - dur: '5.041'
    start: '1265.919'
    text: we the only ones that have really well
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '1268.28'
    text: adapted upper limbs that have nothing to
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '1270.96'
    text: do with Locomotion um even ground Birds
  - dur: '6.519'
    start: '1274.76'
    text: they have wings but they tend to kind of
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '1276.84'
    text: suck as appendages go um but we really
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '1281.279'
    text: we gave up a lot to have these like
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '1283.48'
    text: grabbing objects um and the cost was
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '1286.6'
    text: that we had now have to do this sort of
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '1288.64'
    text: gymnastics routine every time we want to
  - dur: '6.961'
    start: '1290.279'
    text: get from point A to point B so thinking
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '1292.6'
    text: about this um like the neural bases of
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '1297.24'
    text: bipedalism and standing posture is one
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '1299.64'
    text: of those things that feels like kind of
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '1300.76'
    text: like a baser level of behavior than we
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '1303.08'
    text: tend to think about when we&amp;#39;re thinking
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '1304.36'
    text: about the Majesty of human you know
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1307.36'
    text: neuroscience and biology um but it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1309.88'
    text: really fundamental and it&amp;#39;s really core
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '1312.24'
    text: to like what we are as organisms and
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '1314.12'
    text: creatures so I think it&amp;#39;s worth
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '1316.4'
    text: consideration here and
  - dur: '3'
    start: '1320.24'
    text: and
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '1324.2'
    text: yeah yeah and
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '1327.6'
    text: so with that I think we can start
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '1330.039'
    text: transitioning towards like the data
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '1331.799'
    text: collection part of this so if we assume
  - dur: '7.159'
    start: '1334.88'
    text: now that we all have the shared desire
  - dur: '8.279'
    start: '1337.4'
    text: to understand how we weird bipedal
  - dur: '6'
    start: '1342.039'
    text: humans manage to stand as effectively as
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '1345.679'
    text: we do stand upright and walk around as
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '1348.039'
    text: effectively as we do um we can start now
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '1351'
    text: trying to think of this as empirical
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '1352.32'
    text: scientists and start asking the question
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '1354.6'
    text: of if the if that is if the desired
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '1357.88'
    text: outcome the desera of our research
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '1359.679'
    text: Endeavors is to understand the neural
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1362.84'
    text: bases of let&amp;#39;s say just for Simplicity
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '1365.039'
    text: sake standing posture what are the
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '1367.24'
    text: measurements that we can take and what
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '1368.72'
    text: are the analyses that we can do and that
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1371.44'
    text: that would give us insight into the
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '1373.96'
    text: underpinnings of that
  - dur: '7.199'
    start: '1376.08'
    text: behavior um and there&amp;#39;s lot of options
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '1379.64'
    text: um but we&amp;#39;re going to do some simplified
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '1383.279'
    text: not some it&amp;#39;s not even all that
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '1384.799'
    text: simplified but we&amp;#39;re going to take um a
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '1387.2'
    text: full body perspective like you could go
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '1389.08'
    text: in and say oh well I want to figure out
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '1391.64'
    text: the sensitivity like how do we detect
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1393.88'
    text: our lean angle like is it the vestibular
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '1396.36'
    text: organs in our inner ear is it the
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '1398.12'
    text: pressure under our foot is it the is it
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '1400.88'
    text: the the the proprioceptive forces and
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '1402.96'
    text: our ankles how can we measure the
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '1405.159'
    text: sensitivities of those things how can we
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '1407'
    text: sort of understand those circuits what
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '1409.08'
    text: are some other animals we can look at
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '1411.08'
    text: and you can do the kind of like the
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '1412.36'
    text: classic reductive um like biological
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '1415.799'
    text: stuff and start looking at like the the
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '1418.4'
    text: properties of of the muscles and we can
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '1420.72'
    text: you know cut up some cavers and see
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '1422.2'
    text: what&amp;#39;s the density of of you know somata
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '1425.08'
    text: sensory organs in the bottom of the feet
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '1426.76'
    text: we can do that kind of like like zooming
  - dur: '7.16'
    start: '1428.72'
    text: in on one part of the task um but
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '1432.88'
    text: necessarily doing that will leave out
  - dur: '3'
    start: '1435.88'
    text: the actual behavior that we care about
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '1437.799'
    text: and what what we would would call the
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '1438.88'
    text: ecologically valid Behavior behavior of
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1441.96'
    text: the organism in question performing the
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '1444.2'
    text: task that we care about in the real
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1446.84'
    text: world or something close to the real
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '1448.24'
    text: world that you know is the if we assume
  - dur: '2.959'
    start: '1451.08'
    text: we care about standing posture then we
  - dur: '2.88'
    start: '1452.52'
    text: care about standing posture in the real
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '1454.039'
    text: world we don&amp;#39;t care about standing
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '1455.4'
    text: posture in the lab in some weird
  - dur: '3.479'
    start: '1458.08'
    text: artificial environment that we concocted
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '1460.32'
    text: so that we could have something that we
  - dur: '5.881'
    start: '1461.559'
    text: could study um we might have to use that
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '1465.48'
    text: to be able to make any progress but
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '1467.44'
    text: secretly we we will feel a little bit
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '1469.44'
    text: sad because we will know that we have
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '1472.12'
    text: created an artificial representation of
  - dur: '7.441'
    start: '1474.279'
    text: the thing in question and we are not
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1476.6'
    text: actually studying the thing itself
  - dur: '5.439'
    start: '1481.84'
    text: um
  - dur: '3.559'
    start: '1483.72'
    text: so with that
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '1492.039'
    text: said yeah uh I won&amp;#39;t go I won&amp;#39;t do the
  - dur: '4.24'

    text: whole Biz about this but also jumping
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '1497.399'
    text: exists we&amp;#39;re going to course I&amp;#39;m jumping
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '1499.039'
    text: too jumping is kind of like this except
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '1501.6'
    text: instead of like leaning you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '1503.12'
    text: putting Force into the ground and if you
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '1505.36'
    text: put more Force into the ground then you
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '1507.399'
    text: weigh you&amp;#39;ll leave the ground until you
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '1510.96'
    text: have bled off that additional energy and
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '1513.08'
    text: then you&amp;#39;ll come back down and do
  - dur: '7.48'
    start: '1515.12'
    text: something roughly equivalent to
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '1517.279'
    text: that uh yeah
  - dur: '7'
    start: '1525.84'
    text: um yeah okay
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '1530.279'
    text: how do you feel about that so
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '1532.84'
    text: far emotionally prepared for what is to
  - dur: '3'
    start: '1535.64'
    text: come
  - dur: '2.919'
    start: '1540'
    text: great
  - dur: '4.27'
    start: '1541.33'
    text: '[Applause]'
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '1542.919'
    text: so in a little bit here I have an hour
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '1545.6'
    text: and hour to go which there would be
  - dur: '5.519'
    start: '1546.88'
    text: enough time uh spoiler alert I&amp;#39;m going
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '1550.2'
    text: to I&amp;#39;m going to set up some cameras and
  - dur: '7.441'
    start: '1552.399'
    text: those cameras are going to allow us to
  - dur: '7.08'
    start: '1555.12'
    text: record um full body 3D kinematic data of
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '1559.84'
    text: a human person standing in space this
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '1562.2'
    text: human person is me I would love to do a
  - dur: '3'
    start: '1564'
    text: thing where we like record you guys and
  - dur: '6.439'
    start: '1565.36'
    text: do that but like it just the time
  - dur: '9.159'
    start: '1567'
    text: doesn&amp;#39;t really work out um and
  - dur: '7.041'
    start: '1571.799'
    text: so this weird confguration of cheap
  - dur: '7.841'
    start: '1576.159'
    text: cameras and free software will will give
  - dur: '8.36'
    start: '1578.84'
    text: us an approximation of my body uh at 30
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '1584'
    text: frames per second down to some level of
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '1587.2'
    text: precision um
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '1589.32'
    text: at the centimeter scale of precision for
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '1591.72'
    text: my joints and the approximation will be
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '1594.12'
    text: roughly equivalent to this it will tell
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '1596.279'
    text: me roughly where my head was where each
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1598.919'
    text: body segment was where each joint was
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '1601.6'
    text: and this will be kind of like the this
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '1603.679'
    text: is the data model that will come out of
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '1605.799'
    text: it
  - dur: '8.039'
    start: '1608.36'
    text: um and this is where I&amp;#39;m going to start
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '1612.919'
    text: thinking as we go uh and I&amp;#39;m going to
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1616.399'
    text: record myself doing
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '1618.76'
    text: a couple of behaviors so the first thing
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '1621.159'
    text: I&amp;#39;m going to do is
  - dur: '3.161'
    start: '1623.159'
    text: calibrate because I have to do that and
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '1625.12'
    text: I&amp;#39;ll tell you about talk about that as
  - dur: '6.92'
    start: '1626.32'
    text: it goes um then I&amp;#39;m going to
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '1630.48'
    text: do a standing task so I&amp;#39;m going to stand
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '1633.24'
    text: on two
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '1634.64'
    text: feet then I&amp;#39;m going to stand on one
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '1637.799'
    text: foot and then I&amp;#39;m going to stand on the
  - dur: '2.28'
    start: '1639.84'
    text: other
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '1644.08'
    text: foot and then we&amp;#39;re going to probably
  - dur: '2.961'
    start: '1646.279'
    text: I&amp;#39;ll ask someone to pull out a timer we
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '1647.6'
    text: do like 20 30 seconds of standing in
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '1649.24'
    text: each each one so this will be recording
  - dur: '5.961'
    start: '1651.279'
    text: one this will be recording
  - dur: '7.239'
    start: '1653.32'
    text: two uh sorry 0 1 and then
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1657.24'
    text: two I&amp;#39;m going to do the same thing doing
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '1660.559'
    text: this different than I&amp;#39;ve done the past
  - dur: '6.159'
    start: '1661.64'
    text: years but I&amp;#39;m going to do the same
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '1664.279'
    text: thing except
  - dur: '8.601'
    start: '1671.519'
    text: now I&amp;#39;m going to do the same thing while
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '1675.559'
    text: holding on to a chair
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '1685.279'
    text: so I&amp;#39;ll like so I&amp;#39;ll start out doing
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '1687.919'
    text: just like freestanding and then next
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '1690.08'
    text: time I&amp;#39;ll like lean over and like have
  - dur: '3.479'
    start: '1692.08'
    text: my hand on the desk and sort of do the
  - dur: '5.721'
    start: '1693.919'
    text: same kinds of
  - dur: '9.081'
    start: '1695.559'
    text: tasks um then after that I&amp;#39;m going to
  - dur: '7.759'
    start: '1699.64'
    text: do I&amp;#39;m going to take a couple big jumps
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '1704.64'
    text: just jump standing jump as high as I can
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '1707.399'
    text: jump
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '1708.72'
    text: uh and then we&amp;#39;ll do another one where
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '1711.039'
    text: I&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '1711.88'
    text: do like I&amp;#39;ll jump in place for like 30
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '1715.36'
    text: seconds and then at that point that&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '1717.559'
    text: be enough
  - dur: '3'
    start: '1718.6'
    text: recordings
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '1722.72'
    text: um so
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '1724.919'
    text: that yeah so we&amp;#39;re going to so this will
  - dur: '7.681'
    start: '1727.559'
    text: be so we&amp;#39;ll get 1 2 3 four five total
  - dur: '6.481'
    start: '1731.399'
    text: recordings which should process in the
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '1735.24'
    text: moment depending on how fast how long it
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '1737.88'
    text: takes set up I may or may not truncate
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '1740.32'
    text: the processing so that we can get
  - dur: '6.761'
    start: '1741.679'
    text: through them all
  - dur: '8.76'
    start: '1743.88'
    text: um but the your task as you&amp;#39;re watching
  - dur: '6.239'
    start: '1748.44'
    text: the the show um is just kind of think
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '1752.64'
    text: about these behaviors and think about
  - dur: '6.201'
    start: '1754.679'
    text: them relative to the kind of the the
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '1757.279'
    text: biomechanic Center of mass types of uh
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '1760.88'
    text: of conversations we&amp;#39;ve been having so
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '1762.44'
    text: far and just make some predictions about
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '1766.2'
    text: what these data will look like um and
  - dur: '3.199'
    start: '1769.08'
    text: you could think about it at like the
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '1770.24'
    text: full joint level like you know down to
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '1772.279'
    text: the level of like knees and ankles and
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '1774'
    text: shoulders and stuff like that um but
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '1777.08'
    text: that can be a little overwhelming so I
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '1778.96'
    text: would also recommend thinking about it
  - dur: '6.959'
    start: '1780.84'
    text: just in terms of like if you boiled this
  - dur: '8.279'
    start: '1783'
    text: whole thing down to just a ground
  - dur: '6.641'
    start: '1787.799'
    text: plane a foot and a leg and then a center
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '1791.279'
    text: of mass what would you expect to see
  - dur: '2.4'
    start: '1794.44'
    text: like what&amp;#39;s going to be the difference
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '1795.36'
    text: between like standing on two legs versus
  - dur: '3.559'
    start: '1796.84'
    text: standing on one leg what&amp;#39;s gonna be the
  - dur: '3.199'
    start: '1798.6'
    text: difference between standing on one leg
  - dur: '3.561'
    start: '1800.399'
    text: free versus standing one leg while like
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '1801.799'
    text: leaning on a table uh what&amp;#39;s it going to
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '1803.96'
    text: look like when I take a big jump like
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '1807.12'
    text: what&amp;#39;s it going to look like when I take
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '1808.12'
    text: a bunch of jumps
  - dur: '3'
    start: '1810.88'
    text: um
  - dur: '6.441'
    start: '1816.679'
    text: and
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '1818.279'
    text: yeah think about it oo make some
  - dur: '5.439'
    start: '1823.12'
    text: predictions
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '1824.799'
    text: uh because there&amp;#39;s your ability to make
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '1828.559'
    text: predictions about what this is going to
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '1830.399'
    text: go is how you know that you&amp;#39;re operating
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '1832.36'
    text: within a theoretical framework they&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '1835.08'
    text: thinking about there is an assumption
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '1837.32'
    text: that I am making that boiling down the
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '1840.159'
    text: this hyper complex object into a
  - dur: '6.081'
    start: '1841.919'
    text: singular 3D Point Mass and and and
  - dur: '4.239'
    start: '1845.44'
    text: saying I we&amp;#39;ll be able to say things
  - dur: '3.279'
    start: '1848'
    text: about that we&amp;#39;ll be able to predict the
  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '1849.679'
    text: motion of that point mass and say things
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '1851.279'
    text: about that point mass that will tell us
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1852.799'
    text: things about that the global organism um
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '1856'
    text: that&amp;#39;s a that&amp;#39;s a theoretical framework
  - dur: '8.201'
    start: '1857.559'
    text: that&amp;#39;s a strong bold claim um but we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '1862.76'
    text: going to operate within that space
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '1865.76'
    text: and
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '1868.44'
    text: yeah I&amp;#39;m going to try to do this without
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1870.559'
    text: crashing my computer too uh which is
  - dur: '2.28'
    start: '1873.279'
    text: always
  - dur: '3'
    start: '1877.919'
    text: fun
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1885.2'
    text: so great
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '1891.96'
    text: has anybody here worked anywhere near
  - dur: '7.321'
    start: '1894.159'
    text: motion capture before any like physical
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '1897.76'
    text: therapy or anything like that no yeah so
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '1901.48'
    text: it&amp;#39;s one of these things
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '1904.32'
    text: where motion capture like mostly where
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '1907.96'
    text: you will have seen it will be like
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1909.639'
    text: behind the scenes and of movies and
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '1911.919'
    text: video games and stuff like that um you
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '1914.639'
    text: know a lot of like Lord of the Rings
  - dur: '6.399'
    start: '1916.24'
    text: stuff of Golem and smile run running
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '1920.279'
    text: around
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '1922.639'
    text: um all
  - dur: '6.199'
    start: '1924.72'
    text: right uh but it has been around and used
  - dur: '6.481'
    start: '1928.279'
    text: to study human movement for quite some
  - dur: '8.401'
    start: '1930.919'
    text: time um arguably video like the
  - dur: '7.56'
    start: '1934.76'
    text: invention of video uh
  - dur: '3'
    start: '1939.32'
    text: was
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '1944.679'
    text: technically what am I doing here that I
  - dur: '2.279'
    start: '1947.24'
    text: got that
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '1948.519'
    text: I
  - dur: '10.4'
    start: '1949.519'
    text: have this this yes
  - dur: '7.28'
    start: '1955.639'
    text: um and then this so the original
  - dur: '8'
    start: '1959.919'
    text: like video was created to study horses
  - dur: '9.36'
    start: '1962.919'
    text: in motion based off a a barbat uh
  - dur: '8.081'
    start: '1967.919'
    text: from Vanderbilt the guy like the robber
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1972.279'
    text: bearing um about whether or not horses
  - dur: '3.039'
    start: '1976'
    text: ever was there was ever a point in their
  - dur: '3.561'
    start: '1977.399'
    text: Gallop with they at all fourt off the
  - dur: '3.161'
    start: '1979.039'
    text: ground so you&amp;#39;ve probably seen the
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '1980.96'
    text: picture of like this like a bunch of
  - dur: '7.52'
    start: '1982.2'
    text: horses old timey video
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '1985.24'
    text: um basically to solve that bet uh
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '1989.72'
    text: Vanderbilt commissioned a photographer
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '1992.36'
    text: to like take a bunch of sequential
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '1993.799'
    text: videos of pictures of a horse in full
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1996.559'
    text: gallop and was able to show that there
  - dur: '2.319'
    start: '1999.2'
    text: is in fact a phase where they&amp;#39;re all off
  - dur: '1.641'
    start: '2000.559'
    text: the ground where the feet are all off
  - dur: '2.841'
    start: '2001.519'
    text: the
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '2002.2'
    text: ground
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '2004.36'
    text: um but in since then motion capture has
  - dur: '3.559'
    start: '2007.08'
    text: been used in the study of human movement
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '2009.519'
    text: and
  - dur: '7.76'
    start: '2010.639'

    text: um for as long as we&amp;#39;ve been doing
  - dur: '6.361'
    start: '2018.399'
    text: that what am I doing doing this
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '2021.679'
    text: okay uh but also
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '2024.76'
    text: traditionally it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s not a very
  - dur: '5.959'
    start: '2026.96'
    text: common thing to do because it&amp;#39;s very
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '2029.399'
    text: very expensive um the motion capture lab
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '2032.919'
    text: I have in Richards invol has like A4
  - dur: '2.92'
    start: '2035.32'
    text: million dollar worth of motion capture
  - dur: '4.519'
    start: '2037.12'
    text: equipment in it
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '2038.24'
    text: and it&amp;#39;s in a a room that was
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '2041.639'
    text: specifically built for the purpose of
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '2044'
    text: doing motion capture and it&amp;#39;s you know
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '2046.039'
    text: it&amp;#39;s a very good system it&amp;#39;s very very
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '2047.48'
    text: precise but it&amp;#39;s also a huge pain it to
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '2050.159'
    text: use and it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s expensive so the
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '2053.44'
    text: the you know there&amp;#39;s the the number of
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '2055.839'
    text: people out there who are studying human
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '2058.399'
    text: movement is much much larger than the
  - dur: '3.361'
    start: '2060.679'
    text: number of people can who can afford
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '2062'
    text: motion capture so that was kind of a
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '2064.04'
    text: part of the
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '2066.44'
    text: motivation that I had for
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '2070.76'
    text: making this strange
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '2074.399'
    text: system
  - dur: '8.401'
    start: '2076.079'
    text: um was basically realizing around
  - dur: '8.04'
    start: '2080.839'
    text: 2017 when a software came out called uh
  - dur: '7.24'
    start: '2084.48'
    text: open pose that used convolutional neural
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '2088.879'
    text: networks to basically draw a stick
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '2091.72'

    start: '2093.44'
    text: video
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '2095'
    text: and I saw that and then sometime later
  - dur: '7.359'
    start: '2099'
    text: realized
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '2101.4'
    text: that that capacity to basically draw
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '2106.359'
    text: like a 2d skeleton estimate on a person
  - dur: '6.8'
    start: '2108.24'
    text: in a scene
  - dur: '8.839'
    start: '2110.52'
    text: was kind of enough to build a motion
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '2115.04'
    text: capture system out of um and
  - dur: '6.561'
    start: '2119.359'
    text: then you know that was sort of an idea
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '2121.8'
    text: that I had and sort of the thought was
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '2125.92'
    text: yeah that&amp;#39;s a cool idea but like
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '2128.24'
    text: I don&amp;#39;t know how to write code and that
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '2130.52'
    text: seems like way too much work so I guess
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '2133.16'
    text: I&amp;#39;ll never do it and then three years
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '2135.96'
    text: later Co hit and I lost access to my lab
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '2139.4'
    text: for an undef period of time and I also
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '2141.76'
    text: lost faith in the academic system uh
  - dur: '8.48'
    start: '2144.72'
    text: pretty much entirely and started like
  - dur: '6.68'
    start: '2148.52'
    text: rethinking the idea that
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '2153.2'
    text: using I&amp;#39;m going to have to unplug this
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '2155.2'
    text: camera now um
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '2171.92'
    text: sure I&amp;#39;ll turn you off later
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '2178.8'
    text: um yeah I I kind
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '2181.48'
    text: of I started to really doubt the core
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '2184.119'
    text: principle of science which is that the
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '2185.68'
    text: best thing that we can do as scientist
  - dur: '7.321'
    start: '2187.359'
    text: is to publish papers in esoteric
  - dur: '7.439'
    start: '2189.64'
    text: journals that exploit us for profit um
  - dur: '5'
    start: '2194.68'
    text: and started thinking about like you
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '2197.079'
    text: know is this Behavior actually making
  - dur: '4'
    start: '2199.68'
    text: the world a better place and started had
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '2202.119'
    text: the uncomfortable realization that like
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '2203.68'
    text: I don&amp;#39;t really think it does like I
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '2206.44'
    text: think it&amp;#39;s a good thing to do I think
  - dur: '7'
    start: '2208.04'
    text: that you know scientists are generally
  - dur: '8.48'
    start: '2211.04'
    text: trying to like improve the world um but
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2215.04'
    text: we&amp;#39;re trapped in these systems of
  - dur: '3.04'
    start: '2220.24'
    text: of communication that just like it just
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '2221.68'
    text: doesn&amp;#39;t serve like it it made sense in
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '2223.28'
    text: the 1800s it just doesn&amp;#39;t make sense now
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '2225.28'
    text: so I personally transitioned away from
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '2228.119'
    text: publishing papers and journals and
  - dur: '4'
    start: '2230.8'
    text: towards using the skills and
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '2233.28'
    text: understandings that I have from my sort
  - dur: '7.319'
    start: '2234.8'
    text: of history of scientific research to
  - dur: '7.32'
    start: '2237.88'
    text: build tools that people can actually use
  - dur: '7.081'
    start: '2242.119'
    text: in their real
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '2245.2'
    text: lives uh so
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '2249.2'
    text: this is one of
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '2250.319'
    text: them um so real quick if you want to
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '2253.24'
    text: look it up Freo cap just Google Freo cap
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '2255.72'
    text: you&amp;#39;ll find it freeo
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '2258.96'
    text: cap it&amp;#39;s pretty oh I&amp;#39;m not on the
  - dur: '3'
    start: '2261.28'
    text: internet am I on the internet I am on
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '2262.44'
    text: the internet
  - dur: '6.92'
    start: '2264.28'
    text: yeah um hey look people make videos
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '2267.96'
    text: about me
  - dur: '8'
    start: '2271.2'
    text: uh but yeah you can look it up it was a
  - dur: '8.36'
    start: '2274.52'
    text: whole it&amp;#39;s been a whole process um
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '2279.2'
    text: and let&amp;#39;s get to it
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '2282.88'
    text: so so free mo cap stands for free motion
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '2285.64'
    text: capture it is a markless motion capture
  - dur: '4.759'
    start: '2287.56'
    text: system the majority of like traditional
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '2289.2'
    text: motion capture you wind up you wear the
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '2292.319'
    text: spandex with the suits and the
  - dur: '6.201'
    start: '2293.599'
    text: reflective dots this is markerless so
  - dur: '7.439'
    start: '2296.68'
    text: the idea is to use sort of like the
  - dur: '7.44'
    start: '2299.8'
    text: modern sort of uh what&amp;#39;s the
  - dur: '5.881'
    start: '2304.119'
    text: word the the arising technology of just
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '2307.24'
    text: like computer vision and sort of like
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '2310'
    text: the wacky stuff we can do with that to
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '2312.64'
    text: to play the role that the markers used
  - dur: '4.519'
    start: '2314.8'
    text: to play in traditional motion capture
  - dur: '6.92'
    start: '2317'
    text: systems um let&amp;#39;s talk a little bit more
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '2319.319'
    text: what that means I&amp;#39;m actually doing it
  - dur: '6.279'
    start: '2324.56'
    text: um just go
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '2327.44'
    text: uh the hardest part of making this
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2330.839'
    text: process the most sophisticated part of
  - dur: '6.119'
    start: '2332.48'
    text: The Code by by a mile is the part that
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '2335.319'
    text: connects to the cameras um
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '2338.599'
    text: maybe it shouldn&amp;#39;t have been as
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '2340.2'
    text: surprising do
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '2343.839'
    text: this yeah I think that makes sense um so
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '2347.92'
    text: everything is Skelly skelly&amp;#39;s the logo
  - dur: '4'
    start: '2349.48'
    text: it&amp;#39;s like a skeleton you see it&amp;#39;s like
  - dur: '6'
    start: '2351.079'
    text: you know kind of how it works uh my
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '2353.48'
    text: personal Journey as a researcher I was a
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '2357.079'
    text: philosopher I got a bachelor degree in
  - dur: '5.441'
    start: '2359.079'
    text: philosophy then I started doing more
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '2361.04'
    text: perceptual motor neuroscience and kind
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '2364.52'
    text: of like was studying vision from like a
  - dur: '6.119'
    start: '2367'
    text: vision science perspective um and was
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '2370.2'
    text: feeling not it felt insufficient it felt
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '2373.119'
    text: like incomplete and it wasn&amp;#39;t until I
  - dur: '3.759'
    start: '2375.56'
    text: started digging into I started like
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '2377.68'
    text: found my way into some of the more
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '2379.319'
    text: biomechanics approach to movement um
  - dur: '3.881'
    start: '2382.839'
    text: that because I was studying visually
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '2384.599'
    text: guided Locomotion in an environment that
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '2386.72'
    text: really didn&amp;#39;t have any consideration of
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '2388.56'
    text: like the physics of being an object
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2390.64'
    text: moving through space um and when I
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '2392.68'
    text: started reading the biomechanics papers
  - dur: '3.199'
    start: '2395.16'
    text: was when it a lot of things started to
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '2396.44'
    text: click for me and those papers had a
  - dur: '7'
    start: '2398.359'
    text: bunch of skeletons in it calm it down
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '2401.24'
    text: guys um and that&amp;#39;s why there&amp;#39;s skeletons
  - dur: '3.881'
    start: '2405.359'
    text: everywhere just because it&amp;#39;s sort of
  - dur: '4'
    start: '2406.52'
    text: like this it&amp;#39;s like kind of a joke that
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2409.24'
    text: I studi Neuroscience from the
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '2410.52'
    text: perspective of a skeleton because that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '7.319'
    start: '2413.76'
    text: like physics wise it&amp;#39;s mostly skeleton
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '2417.16'
    text: the neural components are really not not
  - dur: '3.881'
    start: '2421.079'
    text: really Newton doesn&amp;#39;t really notice the
  - dur: '7'
    start: '2423.4'
    text: Neuroscience parts of it he mostly
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '2424.96'
    text: notices the skeleton anyway anyway
  - dur: '3'
    start: '2430.76'
    text: um
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '2437.319'
    text: so so this is the latest form of the
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '2440.2'
    text: software um actually it&amp;#39;s not uh the the
  - dur: '5.801'
    start: '2444.359'
    text: main so the current stage of development
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '2447.04'
    text: of free moap is that the the the core
  - dur: '5.439'
    start: '2450.16'
    text: software is a little bit behind the
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '2453.48'
    text: development side of it so we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '8.401'
    start: '2455.599'
    text: using the this camera
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '2459.44'
    text: stuff it&amp;#39;s very slow for some
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '2464.96'
    text: reason why are we so
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '2473.28'
    text: slow okay there we
  - dur: '7.881'
    start: '2477.359'
    text: go oh right I have to turn you off over
  - dur: '7.601'
    start: '2481.599'
    text: here okay apologies to oh I guess we can
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '2485.24'
    text: do that so uh
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '2489.2'
    text: turn you
  - dur: '7.361'
    start: '2490.839'
    text: off okay there you
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '2494.24'
    text: go um let me shut you
  - dur: '3.281'
    start: '2499.359'
    text: down me
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '2503.4'
    text: again so this is one of those places
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '2505.52'
    text: where like all the stuff streaming by is
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '2507.44'
    text: where all the work went and then the
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '2508.8'
    text: outside is quite simple in
  - dur: '3'
    start: '2511.88'
    text: comparison
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '2515.44'
    text: um reasonably confident that this will
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '2517.72'
    text: work but
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '2519.359'
    text: anytime oh wait that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '2540.44'
    text: still
  - dur: '6.8'
    start: '2542.319'
    text: okay hopefully that should work
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '2545.04'
    text: better we can hope
  - dur: '9.119'
    start: '2553.48'
    text: yeah so as a scientific tool um motion
  - dur: '8.68'
    start: '2558.04'
    text: capture is in the very uh crowded space
  - dur: '8.561'
    start: '2562.599'
    text: of being a camera based research tool so
  - dur: '8.32'
    start: '2566.72'
    text: the environmental energy that we
  - dur: '8'
    start: '2571.16'
    text: are encoding and recording in this case
  - dur: '6.039'
    start: '2575.04'
    text: will be light so light bounces off of me
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '2579.16'
    text: bounces goes through the lens of the
  - dur: '4'
    start: '2581.079'
    text: camera gets absorbed by the camera
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '2583.44'
    text: sensor which is just a little
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '2585.079'
    text: rectangular silicone wafer silicon wafer
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '2588.24'
    text: whatever whichever one of those is
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '2589.72'
    text: accurate um
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '2595.4'
    text: and yeah and then we will be recording
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '2599.119'
    text: the we will be pulling samples from a

  - dur: '4.481'
    start: '2637.319'
    text: Eyes videos so we talked about the
  - dur: '2.919'
    start: '2640.4'
    text: mentioned last time the sort of the
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '2641.8'
    text: concept of like spatio temporal
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2643.319'
    text: calibration to in recording and sort of
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '2645.92'
    text: that just like the spatial components
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '2647.839'
    text: and the temporal components great the
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '2650.52'
    text: temporal components here are handled by
  - dur: '3.121'
    start: '2652.079'
    text: the software so we are going to assume
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '2653.8'
    text: that all the the samples from each
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '2655.2'
    text: camera are synchronized in time to some
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '2659.079'
    text: approximation um so the second part of
  - dur: '5.959'
    start: '2662.16'
    text: that is
  - dur: '4'
    start: '2664.119'
    text: the spatial
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '2669.48'
    text: so let&amp;#39;s see so those are all rotated
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '2672.04'
    text: are they rotated the same way they are
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '2674.64'
    text: which
  - dur: '3'
    start: '2675.68'
    text: is
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '2683.28'
    text: counterclockwise I think that should
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '2684.96'
    text: work did I get that right I got it
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '2686.68'
    text: backwards it&amp;#39;s always
  - dur: '6'
    start: '2693.04'
    text: backwards
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '2695'
    text: yeah we here
  - dur: '3.241'
    start: '2700.559'
    text: okay
  - dur: '6.321'
    start: '2701.359'
    text: good
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '2703.8'
    text: um yeah great so it&amp;#39;s not using the
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '2707.68'
    text: space particularly well but don&amp;#39;t worry
  - dur: '3.559'
    start: '2709.52'
    text: about that
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '2720.4'
    text: so this
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '2722.119'
    text: is so now I&amp;#39;m going to point the cameras
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '2726.04'
    text: so I&amp;#39;m going to stand right
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '2727.76'
    text: here and so I&amp;#39;m going to try to point
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '2730.119'
    text: the cameras that they can all get a good
  - dur: '2.76'
    start: '2731.72'
    text: view of that
  - dur: '6.121'
    start: '2739.119'
    text: spot all
  - dur: '9.199'
    start: '2741.4'
    text: right oh I have that one that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '2745.24'
    text: nice we also have that that&amp;#39;s nice
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '2757.839'
    text: okay
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '2759.359'
    text: now unfortunately I
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '2763.119'
    text: am I am going
  - dur: '7.279'
    start: '2765.04'
    text: to I&amp;#39;ll do that later um so the images
  - dur: '5'
    start: '2769.28'
    text: are a little dark I think that is the

    text: make something that&amp;#39;s accessible to the

    text: trying to build it on the cheapest

    start: '2804.319'
    text: game
  - dur: '8.28'
    start: '2806.079'
    text: um okay so we&amp;#39;re going to have to
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '2810.319'
    text: do uh some projective geometry at some
  - dur: '3.041'
    start: '2814.359'
    text: point so I mentioned that we have the
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '2815.72'
    text: temporal synchronization
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '2817.4'
    text: happening through the software um but we
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '2819.8'
    text: are also going to need to know the
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '2821.2'
    text: position of each of these cameras in
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '2822.76'
    text: space we&amp;#39;re going to specifically need
  - dur: '6.399'
    start: '2824.16'
    text: to know the six degree of Freedom
  - dur: '8.641'
    start: '2826.359'
    text: position so XYZ location then
  - dur: '6.881'
    start: '2830.559'
    text: XYZ rotation so six total numbers six
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '2835'
    text: degrees of freedom um and the way we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '2837.44'
    text: going to do that is by way of a
  - dur: '6.641'
    start: '2839.559'
    text: calibration routine um that involves a
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '2842.92'
    text: calibration object um this is called a
  - dur: '3.359'
    start: '2846.2'
    text: Cho
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '2847.52'
    text: these little markers here are called Aro
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '2849.559'
    text: markers and this is a calibration object
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '2852.48'
    text: which many
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '2854.92'
    text: um you know SC every scientific tool
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2857.28'
    text: will have some calibration component to
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '2859.319'
    text: it and the typical pattern for
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '2861.8'
    text: calibration is you&amp;#39;re use you use the
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '2864.96'
    text: system to measure something that you
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '2867.72'
    text: know the answer to I&amp;#39;m going to use this
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '2870.319'
    text: to measure the position of these Corners
  - dur: '6.641'
    start: '2872.359'
    text: in the board because I know that these
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '2875.16'
    text: Corners are all 58 mm apart like I know
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '2879'
    text: that these blast squares are 58 millim
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '2881.04'
    text: wide so if I use this system and I
  - dur: '6.121'
    start: '2883.599'
    text: record this shape I know what the right
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '2886.88'
    text: answer is so if I if I record the
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '2889.72'
    text: position of the board and I check the
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2891.76'
    text: numbers and it says yeah these are 58 mm
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '2894.079'
    text: apart then I now have some confidence
  - dur: '3.559'
    start: '2896.28'
    text: that the system is working as intended
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '2898.319'
    text: and now I can use it to measure the
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '2899.839'
    text: unknown thing which is the body in space
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '2903.24'
    text: that I&amp;#39;m not going to have any other
  - dur: '7.52'
    start: '2904.44'
    text: additional measurement and insight about
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '2907.64'
    text: um so every form of scientific research
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '2911.96'
    text: is going to involve calibration at some
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '2913.88'
    text: point in some cases that calibration is
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '2916'
    text: done at the factory when they&amp;#39;re where
  - dur: '7.599'
    start: '2917.76'
    text: they make the tool um but in this kind
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '2920.96'
    text: of like more hacky DIY world we uh we
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '2925.359'
    text: make do with our own stuff okay how we
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '2927.68'
    text: doing on timeing okay on time all right
  - dur: '3.879'
    start: '2930.96'
    text: so
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '2932.599'
    text: recording so basically what this looks
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '2934.839'
    text: like is I take the board
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '2937.52'
    text: and I show it to the cameras and I make
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '2940.52'
    text: sure that each camera has shared views
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '2943.24'
    text: so in this case they can all see it at
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '2944.48'
    text: the same time um oh I&amp;#39;m going to need to
  - dur: '5.801'
    start: '2947.359'
    text: turn that off
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '2950.24'
    text: actually uh all right you can look here
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '2953.16'
    text: but I have to turn this off because
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '2955.4'
    text: there&amp;#39;s too much light I I was you got
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '2958.96'
    text: to be careful with the light so uh you
  - dur: '8.441'
    start: '2960.799'
    text: can look there if you need to
  - dur: '6.361'
    start: '2964.799'
    text: um so basically the board the cameras
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '2969.24'
    text: can see the board they have shared views
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '2971.16'
    text: of the board um so they can you can do
  - dur: '7.399'
    start: '2974.2'
    text: the kind of the the the actually not so
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '2977.04'
    text: simple math of if I am camera a and I
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '2981.599'
    text: can see the board from this angle and at
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2983.64'
    text: the same time camera B can see the board
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '2986.28'
    text: and I see it from this angle then camera
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '2988.16'
    text: a must be in this position relative to
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '2990.24'
    text: camera B and vice
  - dur: '4'
    start: '2993.24'
    text: versa um
  - dur: '2.479'
    start: '3002.64'
    text: make sure that
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '3012.68'
    text: works usually when I do this part of the
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '3014.88'
    text: class I bring my grad student in to help
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '3017.119'
    text: me out and this time he was busy so I
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '3019.079'
    text: was like I can do it all on my own and I
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3020.72'
    text: can do it all on my own but it is
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '3022.72'
    text: definitely one of the cases I was like I
  - dur: '3.2'
    start: '3024.72'
    text: sure wish Aaron was here it&amp;#39;d be nice to
  - dur: '3.079'
    start: '3026.48'
    text: have
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '3027.92'
    text: an additional nervous
  - dur: '6'
    start: '3029.559'
    text: system doing this
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '3032.68'
    text: stuff uh so now I&amp;#39;m just manually moving
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '3035.559'
    text: stuff from one folder to another just
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '3037.04'
    text: because of the stage of software it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3'
    start: '3040.4'
    text: in
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '3052.359'
    text: um PR what we doing
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '3061.24'
    text: uh you going to run you going to crash
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '3063.319'
    text: did I learn picture anyone
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '3072.96'
    text: ah UV sync
  - dur: '2.68'
    start: '3092.96'
    text: okay we may
  - dur: '6.839'
    start: '3096'
    text: also another traditional
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '3099.4'
    text: so I tested a lot of this but I didn&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '3102.839'
    text: I&amp;#39;m realizing now I didn&amp;#39;t test like
  - dur: '7.399'
    start: '3104.16'
    text: every part of it
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '3106.44'
    text: um so we might find
  - dur: '2.8'
    start: '3111.68'
    text: ourselves having a little bit more
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '3113.4'
    text: running on
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '3114.48'
    text: trust that I would have preferred
  - dur: '9.52'
    start: '3139'
    text: okay well as that runs
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '3143'
    text: um let&amp;#39;s see what are you doing
  - dur: '7.401'
    start: '3154.599'
    text: why okay calling the audible so well
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '3158.92'
    text: remember how so uh I will have to
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '3162'
    text: process these offline because it&amp;#39;s not
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '3163.72'
    text: set up and I don&amp;#39;t have the brain space
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '3165.76'
    text: to do the online debugging so this will
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '3169.04'
    text: be a lot more prediction than usual just
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '3171.96'
    text: usually I can make this happen in the
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '3173.28'
    text: same time
  - dur: '5.519'
    start: '3175.28'
    text: um but
  - dur: '3.279'
    start: '3177.52'
    text: but for
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '3181.04'
    text: now so we&amp;#39;ve done calibration now we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '3184.559'
    text: going to
  - dur: '6.399'
    start: '3185.72'
    text: do simple standing so twoot standing one

    text: foot and one foot on the left one foot
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '3192.119'

    text: be manipulated in this case um and then
  - dur: '3.041'
    start: '3201.599'
    text: we&amp;#39;re going to do this sort of
  - dur: '3.401'
    start: '3202.599'
    text: manipulation condition which is going to
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '3204.64'
    text: be very similar to this but with this
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '3206'
    text: sort of sort of extra factor of I will
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '3208.4'
    text: be supporting myself on a chair or a
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '3211.2'
    text: table or something like that and
  - dur: '6.88'
    start: '3214.28'
    text: your I guess I can use
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '3216.799'
    text: this yeah it&amp;#39;s that um and then we&amp;#39;ll do
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '3221.16'
    text: the jumping stuff
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '3223.559'
    text: so for you know yeah and we&amp;#39;re not going
  - dur: '3.08'
    start: '3226.2'
    text: to be getting uh we&amp;#39;re not going to be
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '3227.599'
    text: getting real time output from this this
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '3229.28'
    text: class unfortunately but that just means
  - dur: '7.521'
    start: '3231.119'
    text: that the your mental model of prediction
  - dur: '7.559'
    start: '3233.76'
    text: must work across times okay now I
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '3238.64'
    text: unfortunately have to take my shoes off
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '3241.319'
    text: which is fine but I just always feel
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '3244.04'
    text: weird doing
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '3245.4'
    text: it um the main reason if I had been
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '3249'
    text: smart I would have at least worn lightly
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3251.2'
    text: colored socks
  - dur: '6.599'
    start: '3253.72'
    text: um
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '3256.2'
    text: but you can see how dark the ground is
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '3260.319'
    text: and you just can&amp;#39;t see my feet relative
  - dur: '7.839'
    start: '3262.52'
    text: to the ground so I
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3265.359'
    text: will Tom soyer up my
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '3270.68'
    text: feet now you
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '3273.76'
    text: can&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '3276.4'
    text: um this is one of
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '3280.68'
    text: the in a real recording I would be like
  - dur: '3.359'
    start: '3283.2'
    text: I&amp;#39;d have lights and stuff like that um
  - dur: '3.879'
    start: '3285.2'
    text: it&amp;#39;s also one of these cases where like
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '3286.559'
    text: it tends to work best like outside in
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '3289.079'
    text: the sun because the sun is very very
  - dur: '6.401'
    start: '3290.839'
    text: bright um yeah there you go now you can
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '3293.72'
    text: see my feet um still a bit dark still
  - dur: '2.28'
    start: '3297.24'
    text: very
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '3299.76'

    text: person thank you
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '3340.48'
    text: uh so I&amp;#39;m going to ask for like
  - dur: '8.159'
    start: '3342.64'
    text: basically 30 second intervals um so I&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '7.359'
    start: '3346.72'
    text: let you know when it&amp;#39;s ready to go
  - dur: '6.841'
    start: '3350.799'
    text: um I do have to turn this off
  - dur: '6.801'
    start: '3354.079'
    text: again and I&amp;#39;ll leave that down
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '3357.64'
    text: and all right where is
  - dur: '7.76'
    start: '3361.4'
    text: the and I want to be standing like here
  - dur: '6.641'
    start: '3366.119'
    text: great all right uh I&amp;#39;ll let you know
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '3369.16'
    text: it&amp;#39;s not right now so here we go so I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '5.559'
    start: '3372.76'
    text: going to stand here and I guess yeah
  - dur: '6.081'
    start: '3374.839'
    text: start it now so this is me
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '3378.319'
    text: standing uh I&amp;#39;m kind of already bored
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '3380.92'
    text: with this so I&amp;#39;m going to lean I&amp;#39;m going
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '3383'
    text: to be sort of intentionally in all these
  - dur: '6.399'
    start: '3386.72'
    text: cases leaning as far as I can lean sort
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3389.359'
    text: of within ideally without moving my feet
  - dur: '2.841'
    start: '3393.119'
    text: um so I&amp;#39;m leaning all the way to the
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '3394.359'
    text: right and all the way
  - dur: '7.839'
    start: '3395.96'
    text: forward uh let me know when we hit
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '3399.44'
    text: 30 there cool
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '3405.799'
    text: no great okay so now I&amp;#39;m on one foot and
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '3410.4'
    text: my Bas of support has now gotten
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '3412.079'
    text: appreciably smaller and I&amp;#39;m wiggling
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '3414.52'
    text: around both for fun and because I&amp;#39;m off
  - dur: '6.599'
    start: '3417'
    text: balance um so again sort of like just
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '3420.72'
    text: look at like what&amp;#39;s happening
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '3423.599'
    text: bodily I&amp;#39;m doing a lot of movement but
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '3427.16'
    text: we have some strong predictions we can
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '3429.319'
    text: make about the position of my center of
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '3432.24'
    text: mass relative to my Bas of support and
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '3434.2'
    text: you make those preditions even stronger
  - dur: '2.599'
    start: '3436.48'
    text: thank
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '3437.44'
    text: you
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '3439.079'
    text: um and
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '3441.52'
    text: Y uh when the base of support gets
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '3444.68'
    text: smaller your ability to predict the
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '3446.599'
    text: location of the center of Mass gets
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '3449.2'
    text: better like you have more predictive
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '3452'
    text: capacity because it is a more
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '3454.799'
    text: constrained task there are fewer ways
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '3457.44'
    text: that I can successfully complete the
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '3459'
    text: task of standing upright when I only
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '3461.559'
    text: have one foot on the ground than I do
  - dur: '4.241'
    start: '3464.039'
    text: when I have two feet on the
  - dur: '5.43'
    start: '3466.48'
    text: ground
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '3468.28'
    text: and and done
  - dur: '5.61'
    start: '3471.91'
    text: '[Applause]'
  - dur: '8.36'
    start: '3473.92'
    text: okay great
  - dur: '7.079'
    start: '3477.52'
    text: so with those predictions in mind
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '3482.28'
    text: um how am I going to do
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '3484.599'
    text: this I think I
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '3495.88'
    text: will yeah that
  - dur: '8.559'
    start: '3498.48'
    text: works great this is my now my standing
  - dur: '8.24'
    start: '3502.16'
    text: stick um so same thing
  - dur: '6.361'
    start: '3507.039'
    text: uh sorry I your name stopwatch friend
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '3510.4'
    text: stopwatch friend what&amp;#39;s your name isab
  - dur: '6.439'
    start: '3513.4'
    text: Isabelle thank you uh same thing now for
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '3516.44'
    text: the let&amp;#39;s say let&amp;#39;s call this a support
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '3519.839'
    text: condition we&amp;#39;re now going to be using
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '3521.599'
    text: like a stick to support myself um
  - dur: '6.639'
    start: '3524.2'
    text: outside of my biologically prescribed
  - dur: '6.081'
    start: '3527.359'
    text: base of support so we go over
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '3530.839'
    text: here and I will stand for a little bit
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '3533.44'
    text: so just go ahead and start the timer
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '3534.64'
    text: whenever this is just kind of
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '3537.799'
    text: calibration
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '3539'
    text: purposes and then
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '3541.039'
    text: now uh I&amp;#39;m going to do the same kind of
  - dur: '6.68'
    start: '3543.2'
    text: task of Leaning as far as I
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '3546.68'
    text: can relative to my base of support
  - dur: '7.76'
    start: '3549.88'
    text: except now I
  - dur: '8.36'
    start: '3551.52'
    text: have this stick to sort of assist me so
  - dur: '6.399'
    start: '3557.64'
    text: with the knowledge and theoretical
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '3559.88'
    text: models of human body that you are armed
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '3564.039'
    text: with like how do you think this is going
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '3566.2'
    text: to change that data um so now I&amp;#39;m going
  - dur: '5.521'
    start: '3568.119'
    text: to go onto my right foot similarly
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '3570.599'
    text: playing all over the place and let&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '3573.64'
    text: assume
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '3574.799'
    text: for like when we get this data back
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '3577.92'
    text: you&amp;#39;re not going to the stick is not
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '3579.359'
    text: going to be in the data uh we will know
  - dur: '6.401'
    start: '3582.079'
    text: that it was there and we&amp;#39;ll know that
  - dur: '6.801'
    start: '3583.839'
    text: this hand is is mounted to the ground um
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '3588.48'
    text: but if you think about what the data
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '3590.64'
    text: will look like you can have some
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '3594.319'
    text: predictions there and now we switch
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3597.28'
    text: feet and so again just like think about
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '3599.559'
    text: it what what do you think would
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '3602.28'
    text: be different
  - dur: '6.599'
    start: '3610.24'
    text: here it&amp;#39;s been a long day it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.481'
    start: '3613.799'
    text: like standing in place is not the
  - dur: '2.76'
    start: '3616.839'
    text: hardest thing in the world but I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '3618.28'
    text: making it
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3619.599'
    text: difficult and
  - dur: '3'
    start: '3627.96'
    text: okay
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '3632.48'
    text: cool okay thank you
  - dur: '7.96'
    start: '3635.72'
    text: Isabelle
  - dur: '8.121'
    start: '3638.359'
    text: um H this next part I hope I
  - dur: '6.399'
    start: '3643.68'
    text: don&amp;#39;t I hope I don&amp;#39;t die on
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '3646.48'
    text: camera but if I
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '3650.319'
    text: do just analyze the
  - dur: '7.359'
    start: '3654.76'
    text: data okay okay um so for this one I am
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '3658.88'
    text: going to record I&amp;#39;ll say three because
  - dur: '3.161'
    start: '3662.119'
    text: that&amp;#39;s what I wrote uh but this is going
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '3663.839'
    text: to be
  - dur: '6.279'
    start: '3665.28'
    text: standing high jump so I&amp;#39;m going to try
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '3667.88'
    text: to jump as high as I can from a standing
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '3671.559'
    text: place and again think about think about
  - dur: '3.879'
    start: '3674.48'
    text: what that will look like think about
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '3675.76'
    text: what it will look like at this level
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '3678.359'
    text: think about what&amp;#39;s happening at the
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '3680.64'
    text: physics level where is the force coming
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '3683.28'
    text: from what when it where is it coming
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '3685.559'
    text: from at the the start where is it going
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '3687.119'
    text: at the end what&amp;#39;s happening in the
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '3689.4'
    text: middle um what could be measured what
  - dur: '5.441'
    start: '3692.559'
    text: could be inferred what additional data
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '3694.88'
    text: will you wish you had
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '3698'
    text: um and if I break anything you know you
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '3702'
    text: can have questions about
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '3704.4'
    text: that okay uh I don&amp;#39;t need a timer for
  - dur: '7.881'
    start: '3708.079'
    text: this so
  - dur: '7.92'
    start: '3711'
    text: record so it goes in here hello I don&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '2.96'

    text: want to whack myself
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '3720.96'
    text: there God I used to I used not weigh as
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '3728.2'
    text: much
  - dur: '3'
    start: '3730.039'

    text: ask do a little bit more okay so big
  - dur: '9.76'
    start: '3751.279'
    text: jumps discreet jumps pauses in the
  - dur: '8.561'
    start: '3755.319'
    text: middle lot of arm swinging and knee
  - dur: '7'
    start: '3761.039'
    text: torquing this big hip joint doing its
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '3763.88'
    text: thing and some amount of air time some
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '3768.039'
    text: amount of cheating in the air
  - dur: '7.319'
    start: '3770.52'
    text: time
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3772.839'

    start: '3793.76'
    text: more probably be more
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '3796.4'
    text: reliable uh
  - dur: '6.641'
    start: '3801.119'
    text: okay okay so now instead of doing sub
  - dur: '5.519'
    start: '3805.76'
    text: veral discreet high jumps I&amp;#39;m just going
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '3807.76'
    text: to bounce in place uh and I&amp;#39;ll bounce in
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '3811.279'
    text: place for as long as I want to which I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '3814.2'
    text: not going to ask anyone to time it I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '3816'
    text: just going to go until I want to stop
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '3817.799'
    text: may do at least 10 and then I&amp;#39;ll just go
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '3820.16'
    text: until I&amp;#39;m tired and I&amp;#39;m already tired so
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '3822.92'
    text: we&amp;#39;ll see how that
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '3824.52'
    text: goes oh also pointing out I pulled my
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '3828'
    text: legs up I pulled the pants up both to
  - dur: '6.881'
    start: '3830.319'
    text: expose the nice pale skin below which
  - dur: '5.919'
    start: '3834.16'
    text: does well this feels bright to us but
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '3837.2'
    text: our eyes um the human eye is incredibly
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '3840.079'
    text: good at adjusting to changes in
  - dur: '6.879'
    start: '3841.72'
    text: luminance so relative to like a sunny
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '3845.4'
    text: day it&amp;#39;s basically Pitch Black in here
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '3848.599'
    text: and we&amp;#39;re just really really good at
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '3850.079'
    text: adapting to that um but so I exposed my
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '3854.039'
    text: legs both because they are lighter and
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '3855.839'
    text: they are contrasting with the carpet but
  - dur: '6.439'
    start: '3858.64'
    text: I&amp;#39;m also trying to give the cameras a
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '3861.559'
    text: view of my knee um as opposed to having
  - dur: '2.76'
    start: '3865.079'
    text: it be blocked again like if you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.879'
    start: '3866.68'
    text: trying if you&amp;#39;re trying to predict where
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '3867.839'
    text: my knee is it&amp;#39;s going to be way harder
  - dur: '6.201'
    start: '3870.559'
    text: if it&amp;#39;s being covered by cloth than it
  - dur: '7.319'
    start: '3872.76'
    text: is if it&amp;#39;s directly exposed so it&amp;#39;s not
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '3876.76'
    text: just a fashion statement it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '7.081'
    start: '3880.079'
    text: empirically
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '3881.319'
    text: grounded okay so yeah
  - dur: '7.76'
    start: '3887.44'
    text: so we&amp;#39;ll say we&amp;#39;ll call this discret
  - dur: '6.041'
    start: '3890.599'
    text: jumps and we&amp;#39;ll call this repeated Hops
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '3895.2'
    text: and boun
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '3896.64'
    text: so again thinking about the behavior
  - dur: '5.479'
    start: '3898.64'
    text: thinking about the mechanics thinking
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '3900.68'
    text: about the joint torqus thinking about
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '3904.119'
    text: the fatigue where does the energy come
  - dur: '7.64'
    start: '3906.52'
    text: from what did I have for dinner last
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '3908.559'
    text: night these are the questions of biology
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '3916.48'
    text: okay I&amp;#39;m not going to drop time it okay
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '3919.52'
    text: so
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '3921.16'
    text: record standing here give that nice
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '3924.599'
    text: calibration of
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '3926.4'
    text: and now we hop okay one 2
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '3931.16'
    text: 3 oh my God there&amp;#39;s just so many people

    text: are there people below us are they
  - dur: '6.159'
    start: '3940.96'
    text: wondering what&amp;#39;s happening I don&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '7.399'
    start: '3944.2'
    text: know how long have I been jumping how
  - dur: '7.92'
    start: '3947.119'
    text: many jumps was that I don&amp;#39;t know okay I
  - dur: '8.401'
    start: '3951.599'
    text: think I think that&amp;#39;s playing 10 more
  - dur: '6.601'
    start: '3955.039'
    text: okay one two three four five six 7even 8

    start: '3966.799'
    text: done
  - dur: '7.599'
    start: '3969.24'
    text: okay great data collected not

    start: '3973.839'
    text: processed
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3979.52'
    text: um okay
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '4005.44'
    text: um let me see if I can get this thing
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '4007.64'
    text: running I&amp;#39;ll give it one one more
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '4010.079'
    text: College try as they say
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '4032.72'
    text: oh I need to get myself enough time to
  - dur: '2.439'
    start: '4033.92'
    text: clean up
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '4039.559'
    text: too okay good

    text: and REM cap huh huh
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4152'
    text: huh
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '4158.6'
    text: huh oh right you can&amp;#39;t see anything
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4160.759'
    text: sorry
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '4175.719'
    text: sort of
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '4176.88'
    text: the fundamental nature of working on
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '4180.679'
    text: anything for any length of time
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '4182.96'
    text: particularly if the thing you&amp;#39;re making
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '4184.199'
    text: is something that other people are
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '4186.48'
    text: using uh the version of the thing that
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4189.4'
    text: other that the people are using is the
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '4191.08'
    text: version that you are like ashamed of
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '4194.32'
    text: because like I the code for this I wrote
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '4197.64'
    text: years ago I&amp;#39;ve learned so much since
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '4200.12'
    text: then that when I look at this I&amp;#39;m like
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '4201.56'
    text: oh my God I&amp;#39;m so sorry to the world for
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '4205'
    text: what I&amp;#39;ve done to it okay so this is
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4207.04'
    text: freemo Cap this is the core software
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '4210.76'
    text: um
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '4212.56'
    text: then if I
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '4214.8'
    text: do
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '4216.719'
    text: that I click on that say set active
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4219.679'
    text: recording
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '4229.88'
    text: yes yes run calibration from active
  - dur: '3.441'
    start: '4233.679'
    text: recording run
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '4235.32'
    text: calibration
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '4237.12'
    text: okay so we&amp;#39;re now
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '4239.719'
    text: running calibration
  - dur: '6.441'
    start: '4242.199'
    text: data um and it&amp;#39;s going through I can put
  - dur: '5.521'
    start: '4246.239'
    text: my shoes on at least um it&amp;#39;s going
  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '4248.64'
    text: through and uh
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '4253.12'
    text: detecting the boards in the screen
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '4256.12'
    text: um it&amp;#39;ll take a little bit of time but
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '4259.32'
    text: at this point I think we should be able
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '4260.76'
    text: to get like we&amp;#39;ll be able to look at
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '4262.84'
    text: something by the end of but before the
  - dur: '2.92'
    start: '4264.52'
    text: end of the day which will be
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4274.44'
    text: good does anyone have any burning
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '4277.32'
    text: questions while we&amp;#39;re while the thing is
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4279.44'
    text: running it&amp;#39;s one of those things like
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '4281.56'
    text: I&amp;#39;m sure there are many questions so
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '4284.36'
    text: does can anyone choose one question from
  - dur: '3.08'
    start: '4287.36'
    text: the many that are floating
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '4292.96'
    text: around I also made a mistake because I
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '4295.719'
    text: was like talking during this calibration
  - dur: '3.281'
    start: '4297.639'
    text: thing so I was like doing it and at some
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4299.32'
    text: point I was like blah blah blah and then
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '4300.92'
    text: so it&amp;#39;s longer than it needs to be uh
  - dur: '2.76'
    start: '4304.32'
    text: which is rookie
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '4309.199'
    text: mistake this is the code that I am like
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '4311.719'
    text: currently rewriting like I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4313.88'
    text: currently uh
  - dur: '2.839'
    start: '4315.88'
    text: rebuilding the calibration part of it
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4317.88'
    text: which
  - dur: '7.641'
    start: '4318.719'
    text: will allow it to do much
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '4322.92'
    text: more it&amp;#39;ll be
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4336.679'
    text: faster okay
  - dur: '3.321'
    start: '4356.159'
    text: um I guess I could look at the other
  - dur: '2.92'
    start: '4358.239'
    text: stuff but I don&amp;#39;t really want to do that
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '4359.48'
    text: that feels like cheating like I have
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '4361.159'
    text: recordings from the past but that&amp;#39;s that
  - dur: '2.919'
    start: '4363.8'
    text: feels like cheating right
  - dur: '6.361'
    start: '4367.239'
    text: now
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4369.6'
    text: um yeah
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4378.239'
    text: H
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '4384.8'
    text: okay
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '4386.56'
    text: yes okay now this stuff is going
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '4392.44'
    text: through yeah
  - dur: '5.759'
    start: '4395.44'
    text: great so now
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '4398.32'
    text: now
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '4401.199'
    text: now you have this
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '4404.12'
    text: object should I can&amp;#39;t write now for some
  - dur: '6.879'
    start: '4406.76'
    text: reason so camera 0o camera 1 camera 2
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '4410.36'
    text: camera Matrix and then these are the two
  - dur: '7.08'
    start: '4413.639'
    text: points that matter rotation 1 2 3
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '4417.48'
    text: translation 1 2 3 camera one is defined
  - dur: '3.321'
    start: '4420.719'
    text: to zero so these are the six degrees of
  - dur: '2.44'
    start: '4422.88'
    text: freedom that we need for each of the
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '4424.04'
    text: cameras so we now know where all the
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '4425.32'
    text: cameras are these are measured in
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '4427.36'
    text: millimeters and
  - dur: '7.16'
    start: '4429.12'
    text: theoretically you know 1 and 1/2 so 1
  - dur: '6.8'
    start: '4433.04'
    text: 1500 mm is like 1 and 1/2 m
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '4436.28'
    text: th M so they say that they&amp;#39;re you know
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '4439.84'
    text: meter to two apart
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '4441.679'
    text: which checks out intuitively so now that
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '4445'
    text: we have
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '4446.36'
    text: that uh we
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '4451.04'
    text: can okay I think let&amp;#39;s look at the jump
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '4454.32'
    text: the big jump that&amp;#39;s the most fun one I
  - dur: '6.321'
    start: '4456.159'
    text: think so that was
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4458.48'
    text: the actually
  - dur: '4.759'
    start: '4472.44'
    text: yeah oh it&amp;#39;s kind of off screen there
  - dur: '2.639'
    start: '4474.56'
    text: but we&amp;#39;ll see how that
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '4477.48'
    text: goes uh set is active
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4481.639'
    text: recording
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '4483.28'
    text: okay these most recent
  - dur: '7.161'
    start: '4486.679'
    text: calibration and that probably the
  - dur: '8.08'
    start: '4489.44'
    text: shortest too so go ahead and
  - dur: '7.24'
    start: '4493.84'
    text: process okay okay so if all goes well do
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '4497.52'
    text: you see my blender you do see my blender
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '4501.08'
    text: great so now what it&amp;#39;s doing is it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '4503.88'
    text: going
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '4505.36'
    text: through and in each of the videos it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '4509.199'
    text: going through frame by frame um so let
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '4511.8'
    text: say if it&amp;#39;s a you know a thousand frames

  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '4517.92'
    text: 30 seconds or something less than 30
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '4519.32'
    text: seconds actually um then for three
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '4522.48'
    text: cameras you have 3,000 total images and
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '4525.28'
    text: then in each of those images you have to
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '4527.679'
    text: run through and do the relatively heavy
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '4529.96'
    text: computation of using the convolutional
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '4532.159'
    text: neural network to try to detect where
  - dur: '7.76'
    start: '4534.52'
    text: the person is in the screen uh in the
  - dur: '6.841'
    start: '4539.199'
    text: recording and that will look oh actually
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '4542.28'
    text: that&amp;#39;s from old okay never
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4546.52'
    text: mind
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '4549.6'
    text: um yeah and so then once you have done
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '4552.44'
    text: that you will
  - dur: '8.201'
    start: '4556.679'
    text: have 3,00 two-dimensional estimates of
  - dur: '5.961'
    start: '4560.639'
    text: where I was in space coupled with
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '4564.88'
    text: estimates for where each of the cameras
  - dur: '7.119'
    start: '4566.6'
    text: were in space and so you can
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '4570.36'
    text: do don&amp;#39;t worry about that that&amp;#39;s normal
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '4573.719'
    text: um you from so from the the
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '4576.239'
    text: two-dimensional estimates in the images
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '4578.6'
    text: plus the six degree of Freedom positions
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '4581.12'
    text: of the cameras you can triangulate the
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '4584.04'
    text: position of each of those point points
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '4585.679'
    text: by basically just imagining firing a
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '4588.159'
    text: laser so like tracking my elbow from
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '4590.12'
    text: camera 1 2 and three if you imagine you
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '4592.32'
    text: fired a laser from each of those cameras
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '4594.56'
    text: the place where the lasers cross over
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '4596.28'
    text: each other is the position of that
  - dur: '6'
    start: '4598.28'
    text: object in space
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4600.679'
    text: um and all of that is going to happen
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '4604.28'
    text: under the
  - dur: '6.321'
    start: '4605.679'
    text: hood very very fast and it&amp;#39;s all just a
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '4609.12'
    text: bunch of like like that kind of geometry
  - dur: '3.719'
    start: '4612'
    text: hasn&amp;#39;t changed in like a thousand years
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4614.199'
    text: it&amp;#39;s the same stuff that that&amp;#39;s like
  - dur: '6.641'
    start: '4615.719'
    text: uclid level geometry it&amp;#39;s just now being
  - dur: '8.761'
    start: '4618.719'
    text: done much much much faster on
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '4622.36'
    text: a strange rectangle of silicone and
  - dur: '6.759'
    start: '4630.44'
    text: electricity
  - dur: '9.48'
    start: '4632.52'
    text: um but yeah once this pink line oh are
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '4637.199'
    text: we still running oh good we can actually
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '4648.719'
    text: yeah so it looks roughly like that so
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '4651.28'
    text: this is the output from one of the
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '4652.92'
    text: videos so this
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '4660.4'
    text: is so from the perspective of I guess
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4663.32'
    text: that camera this was the location of my
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4666.36'
    text: right shoulder that&amp;#39;s the left shoulder
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '4668.36'
    text: there&amp;#39;s a bunch of points on my face
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4670.36'
    text: these are hips
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '4671.8'
    text: ankles toes basically tagging all the
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '4674.88'
    text: joint centers in two-dimensional image
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '4677.84'
    text: coordinates
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '4680.6'
    text: um which we
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '4689.04'
    text: can and
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '4691.6'
    text: so yeah so that&amp;#39;s all well and good it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '7.28'
    start: '4696'
    text: useful information but you would have a
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4697.76'
    text: very difficult time doing any of the the
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4705.32'
    text: because you don&amp;#39;t really have a
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '4707.6'
    text: measurement in this case of like where
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '4709.32'
    text: the ground is like you don&amp;#39;t really have
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4711.04'
    text: a measurement of what up is you have up
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '4714.08'
    text: in the image but you can see that the
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '4716.08'
    text: image is tilted so if you&amp;#39;re want to say
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '4718.639'
    text: oh you&amp;#39;re moving relative to gravity
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '4720.52'
    text: like if you want to say your balance
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '4722.239'
    text: over your feet those are all terms that
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '4724.639'
    text: happen in the reference frame of like
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '4727.44'
    text: the physics we said we call it the
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '4728.92'
    text: inertial reference frame um and this
  - dur: '6.479'
    start: '4732.76'
    text: data is all coming in in
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '4735.36'
    text: camera sensor reference frame this is 0
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '4739.239'
    text: in image coordinates just the upper left
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '4741.239'
    text: point of the screen and that&amp;#39;s 0 meaning
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '4743.96'
    text: the upper left corner of the little
  - dur: '6'
    start: '4745.719'
    text: silicone wafer the at the back of the
  - dur: '6.239'
    start: '4748'
    text: camera thing um so converting that into
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '4751.719'
    text: something that
  - dur: '3.361'
    start: '4754.239'
    text: is it&amp;#39;s very strange that that one is
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '4756.36'
    text: like running so much slower than the
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '4757.6'
    text: others
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '4760.4'
    text: um but to be able to be able to talk
  - dur: '3.08'
    start: '4763.92'
    text: about this data in sort of these
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '4765.76'
    text: physically grounded terms that we&amp;#39;ve
  - dur: '6.639'
    start: '4767'
    text: been trying to sort of build up uh
  - dur: '6'
    start: '4770.199'
    text: requires a transfer and sort of a lot of
  - dur: '7.56'
    start: '4773.639'
    text: computation to sort of to get this
  - dur: '7.241'
    start: '4776.199'
    text: data referenced in a inertial reference
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '4781.199'
    text: frame
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '4783.44'
    text: okay what is going on okay cool um so
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '4787.36'
    text: now the pink lines are gone which means
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '4789.04'
    text: we&amp;#39;ve done all the 2D estimation and
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4791.04'
    text: this white much much faster line is
  - dur: '9.76'
    start: '4792.76'
    text: doing all of the triangulation so so uh
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '4795.96'
    text: 550,000 data points uh just
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4802.56'
    text: cranking
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4806.76'
    text: yeah
  - dur: '7.32'
    start: '4811.08'
    text: and now how we going doing
  - dur: '7.96'
    start: '4814.44'
    text: that recording data this takes a
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4818.4'
    text: s now
  - dur: '6.799'
    start: '4824.92'
    text: okay yeah it&amp;#39;s now saving stuff down to
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '4827.679'
    text: disk and now it
  - dur: '6.841'
    start: '4831.719'
    text: will with any
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '4833.84'
    text: luck start cranking
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '4841.12'
    text: yeah come on
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4844.639'
    text: buddy
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '4848.6'
    text: yeah yes and so now this this part of
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4851.159'
    text: the code is now sending so at this point
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '4853.84'
    text: we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;ve done the main
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '4855.679'
    text: task we&amp;#39;ve recorded the PE the person
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '4857.6'
    text: we&amp;#39;ve done the two-dimensional thing the
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '4859.639'
    text: 3D reconstruction has actually already
  - dur: '6.879'
    start: '4861.36'
    text: happened um and now a very important
  - dur: '7.36'
    start: '4864.56'
    text: often neglected step is occurring which
  - dur: '6.281'
    start: '4868.239'
    text: is converting it into a human into some
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '4871.92'
    text: visualizable format so something that we
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '4874.52'
    text: as humans can look at and make sense of
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '4876.88'
    text: because saving all the data out until
  - dur: '6.559'
    start: '4878.6'
    text: like a massive CSV Excel spreadsheet is
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '4882.04'
    text: good but like it&amp;#39;s still not a a term
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4885.159'
    text: that we can really make any sense out of
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '4887.6'
    text: so or a format that we can make sense
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '4890.159'
    text: out of so this is blender which is a 3D
  - dur: '7.16'
    start: '4893.36'
    text: animation software and this is where we
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '4895.84'
    text: see if it actually worked well which I
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '4901.84'
    text: feel let&amp;#39;s see how it does so I&amp;#39;m not in
  - dur: '8.241'
    start: '4905.239'
    text: the screen there we go here I
  - dur: '7.96'
    start: '4908.56'
    text: am it&amp;#39;s okay so this one is not looking
  - dur: '3.04'
    start: '4913.48'
    text: the best
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '4918'
    text: so you see this one it&amp;#39;s um the image is
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '4920.159'
    text: upside down is it going to it&amp;#39;s going to
  - dur: '7.959'
    start: '4922.28'
    text: fix oh man there we go so that was
  - dur: '6.921'
    start: '4926.639'
    text: actually a nice uh case
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '4930.239'
    text: where this is a good view this is a good
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '4933.56'
    text: view this one it&amp;#39;s seeing the skeleton
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '4935.8'
    text: upside down uh so this reconstructive
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '4939.8'
    text: view is not going to look right because
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '4941.36'
    text: a third of the data is flipped upside
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '4943.52'
    text: down and luckily I took a few steps
  - dur: '5.721'
    start: '4946.639'
    text: forward and then it fixed itself and so
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '4948.76'
    text: now this is a much better looking
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4952.36'
    text: skeleton
  - dur: '7.201'
    start: '4956.239'
    text: um see time go can&amp;#39;t time so now that I
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '4960.4'
    text: know it works I can blame the point
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '4963.44'
    text: um it&amp;#39;s a little bit rotated which I can
  - dur: '9.52'
    start: '4966.48'
    text: fix later so rotate around
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '4970.4'
    text: X there you go um
  - dur: '8.44'
    start: '4976.04'
    text: this pink and blue ball here is the
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '4981.08'
    text: calculated Center of mass um the
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '4984.48'
    text: skeleton is sort of more for
  - dur: '7.48'
    start: '4987.28'
    text: visualization than actual data
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '4990.8'
    text: um this these stick figures here those
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '4994.76'
    text: are the rigid bodies that I was talking
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '4996.36'
    text: about so this is
  - dur: '7.52'
    start: '4998.92'
    text: the the thigh the upper arm things like
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '5003.12'
    text: that and
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '5014.6'
    text: cool yeah great and so
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '5026.52'
    text: now okay so it&amp;#39;s not the best data I&amp;#39;ve
  - dur: '6'
    start: '5031.12'
    text: ever gotten in my life it&amp;#39;s just very
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '5032.92'
    text: dark in here um um but it&amp;#39;s not bad and
  - dur: '2.4'
    start: '5037.12'
    text: if I
  - dur: '3'
    start: '5047.4'
    text: look
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '5057.6'
    text: oops so that is the trajectory of my
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '5060.719'
    text: center of
  - dur: '10.76'
    start: '5062.12'
    text: mass in the Z coordinate so the ground
  - dur: '9.44'
    start: '5066.36'
    text: plane we&amp;#39;re going to call XY up is z um
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '5072.88'
    text: and yeah and so this is a Time series
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '5075.8'
    text: plot we talked about these last time so
  - dur: '6.88'
    start: '5078'
    text: the x axis is time and then the Y AIS is
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '5082.159'
    text: whatever the the Z value that is the
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '5084.88'
    text: height that&amp;#39;s the height of my center of
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '5086.48'
    text: mass above the ground and if you recall
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '5089.239'
    text: so if gravity didn&amp;#39;t change my mass
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '5091.679'
    text: didn&amp;#39;t change so that means the height
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '5093.8'
    text: tells you
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '5095.159'
    text: my potential energy uh if we assume that
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '5098.719'
    text: this is where I&amp;#39;m this is my standing
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '5100.48'
    text: height we can call that zero if we want
  - dur: '6.199'
    start: '5103'
    text: to that&amp;#39;s zero potential energy and then
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '5106'
    text: here we see something interesting
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '5109.199'
    text: happening so before I you&amp;#39;ve seen this
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '5111.76'
    text: several times now I do got to stop and
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '5114.119'
    text: we&amp;#39;re going to talk about this at length
  - dur: '6.68'
    start: '5115.88'
    text: next time um but just imagine at like my
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '5119.639'
    text: center of mass level like we have some
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '5122.56'

    text: responds to um so think about what is
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '5128.76'
    text: this dip what is this peak and what is
  - dur: '2.48'
    start: '5131.159'
    text: this dip
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '5134.08'
    text: again and oops wish I didn&amp;#39;t do
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '5143.719'
    text: that come on there we
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '5149.8'
    text: go so there we go that&amp;#39;s my lowest point
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '5152.92'
    text: skeleton&amp;#39;s kind of screwy
  - dur: '6.201'
    start: '5155.119'
    text: uh just because it&amp;#39;s a weird View and
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '5157.199'
    text: I&amp;#39;m kind of off screen here
  - dur: '3'
    start: '5164.76'
    text: um
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '5168.8'
    text: but going to go up and that&amp;#39;s the peak
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '5172.88'
    text: that&amp;#39;s the apex of the jump that&amp;#39;s the
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '5175.159'
    text: highest this is the place my my
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '5178.44'
    text: potential energy is at its highest and
  - dur: '6'
    start: '5180.36'
    text: my kinetic energy in the in the Z
  - dur: '8.961'
    start: '5182.639'
    text: position is zero I&amp;#39;m I am paused at that
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '5186.36'
    text: height um and now I&amp;#39;m coming back
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '5193'
    text: down and again the the the data is not
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '5195.6'
    text: the best in the world but you can see
  - dur: '2.4'
    start: '5197.88'
    text: that kind
  - dur: '6.401'
    start: '5201.119'
    text: of I don&amp;#39;t just land with like straight
  - dur: '5.719'
    start: '5204.52'
    text: legs I land and I bend into
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '5207.52'
    text: it there&amp;#39;s intuitive reasons why but
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '5210.239'
    text: then there&amp;#39;s also like deeper
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '5211.6'
    text: biomechanical and biopys and
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '5213.199'
    text: physiological reasons why why this is a
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '5215.36'
    text: lot of energy I have to bleed off and I
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '5217.84'
    text: don&amp;#39;t want to Bleed It Off directly into
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '5219.44'
    text: my joints I would rather bleed it off
  - dur: '4.519'
    start: '5221.6'
    text: into my soft tissue and let the muscles
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '5223.56'
    text: kind of pull against it so that I don&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '5226.119'
    text: blow out my Meniscus or something like
  - dur: '7.361'
    start: '5228.679'
    text: that
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '5231.4'
    text: um and then I do it
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '5237.239'
    text: again and so this is also kind of a nice
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '5239.52'
    text: example of why the center of mass is
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '5241.08'
    text: such a nice measurement because even in
  - dur: '4'
    start: '5243'
    text: these cases where the data is not that
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '5244.92'
    text: great and the skeleton gets all wble
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '5247'
    text: garble in these in these particular
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '5248.76'
    text: moments the overall trajectory is
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '5251.8'
    text: roughly speaking what you would expect
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '5253.4'
    text: it to be so even in context where the
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '5255.96'
    text: data has you know Fidelity issues uh you
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '5259.96'
    text: can still talk about the global data
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '5261.84'
    text: because it&amp;#39;s basically a giant smoothing
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '5264.119'
    text: algorithm to just collapse this entire
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '5266.239'
    text: thing down to a singular
  - dur: '3'
    start: '5268.08'
    text: point
  - dur: '6.201'
    start: '5271.199'
    text: we uh and then I really I I got to go
  - dur: '8.92'
    start: '5274.56'
    text: but I can&amp;#39;t help myself
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '5277.4'
    text: uh in range around frame
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '5284.159'
    text: '3030'
  - dur: '6.639'
    start: '5286.08'
    text: calculate the whole
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '5288.08'
    text: thing okay let
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '5302.6'
    text: play so that is is the frame by frame
  - dur: '5.239'
    start: '5306.4'
    text: measurement of it you can see this the
  - dur: '2.559'
    start: '5309.08'
    text: 3D
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '5312.48'
    text: trajectory oh why did it go oh it&amp;#39;s not
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '5314.44'
    text: doing the whole path oh cuz it&amp;#39;s much
  - dur: '8.079'
    start: '5317.08'
    text: longer than
  - dur: '6.679'
    start: '5318.48'
    text: that uh dat paths all paths
  - dur: '2.359'
    start: '5334.76'
    text: there you
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '5339.119'
    text: go and here we can even take the whole
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '5341.52'
    text: guy hide
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '5343.32'
    text: him hide
  - dur: '8.04'
    start: '5350.96'
    text: him so that is the
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '5355.88'
    text: mechanical estimate of the global
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '5359'
    text: Behavior okay I will take my time I&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '5362.32'
    text: I&amp;#39;ll clean this up um
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '5367.119'
    text: and think about think about the things
  - dur: '3.719'
    start: '5370.96'
    text: we talk about make some general
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '5372.76'
    text: predictions um I&amp;#39;m going to make an
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '5374.679'
    text: assignment for y&amp;#39;all for next uh for the
  - dur: '4.239'
    start: '5378'
    text: next for next week about talking to the
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '5379.92'
    text: bot about predictions around this data
  - dur: '3.361'
    start: '5382.239'
    text: stuff and also about just like the
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '5384.04'
    text: concept of units and measurements and
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '5385.6'
    text: how it applies to your particular domain
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '5387.32'
    text: of inquiry um but just you know chew on
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '5390.719'

    text: we&amp;#39;re recording now um so to repeat that
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '4.16'
    text: um the the proper assignment like the
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '7.319'
    text: the proper proper like poster proposal
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '9.559'
    text: assignment will be on uh like a one or
  - dur: '3.561'
    start: '13.679'
    text: two sentence right up on the topic area
  - dur: '6.081'
    start: '15.759'
    text: that you&amp;#39;re going to want your poster to
  - dur: '7.16'
    start: '17.24'
    text: be on and a singular citation of a paper
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '21.84'
    text: that kind of represents what that
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '24.4'
    text: research what what what that like
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '27.119'
    text: research in the area that you&amp;#39;re going
  - dur: '4.999'
    start: '28.56'
    text: to be presenting on um um the standard
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '31.279'
    text: assignment for 22.99 is that you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '33.559'
    text: supposed to pick a singular paper for
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '35.879'
    text: the whole semester and then your poster
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '37.6'
    text: is going to be you presenting just that
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '39.719'
    text: paper um I think we can go a little bit
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '42.2'
    text: beyond that if that&amp;#39;s all you want to do
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '44.16'
    text: that&amp;#39;s totally valid um but I think we
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '46.039'
    text: can do a little bit more broad of a of
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '48.64'
    text: an overview um
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '51.359'
    text: and uh but to keep us kind of honest
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '54.8'
    text: we&amp;#39;re just I&amp;#39;m going to ask you to to
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '56.52'
    text: pick a singular paper and then the the
  - dur: '6.239'
    start: '59.28'
    text: bot me mediated conversation will be
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '62.92'
    text: sort of designed to help you do that so
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '65.519'
    text: if you you know give it say here&amp;#39;s the
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '67.36'
    text: topic I want to study um here&amp;#39;s a paper
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '69.64'
    text: I&amp;#39;m thinking about here&amp;#39;s the abstract
  - dur: '2.919'
    start: '71.84'
    text: um I&amp;#39;ll prompt I&amp;#39;ll make the bot
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '73.24'
    text: prompted to kind of like ask you the
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '74.759'
    text: kind of questions um that you know I
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '77.6'
    text: would ask you if I have the time and
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '79.72'
    text: energy to kind of sit down and talk
  - dur: '7.719'
    start: '81.4'
    text: about it um behind the curtain when they
  - dur: '7.48'
    start: '84.36'
    text: talk about this class uh the most of
  - dur: '5.721'
    start: '89.119'
    text: what they tell us to do is try to help
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '91.84'
    text: you guys not pick a review article for
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '94.84'
    text: your paper and to pick an actual proper
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '97.24'
    text: like Empirical research article like
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '99.2'
    text: because it&amp;#39;s really it&amp;#39;s like like if
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '102.32'
    text: you just go search for papers on a given
  - dur: '2.6'
    start: '104'
    text: topic you&amp;#39;re going to find review
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '105.28'
    text: articles at the top of that list and
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '106.6'
    text: it&amp;#39;s not always super obvious whether
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '109.24'
    text: you&amp;#39;re looking at a review article or a
  - dur: '6.881'
    start: '110.759'
    text: book chaper or like an empirical study
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '114.52'
    text: um so I can tell the bot to help you
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '117.64'
    text: with that uh and it&amp;#39;ll do things like
  - dur: '3.199'
    start: '119.92'
    text: asking you about the methodologies and
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '121.799'
    text: topics and stuff like that so just kind
  - dur: '3.881'
    start: '123.119'
    text: of like helping you kind of like parse
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '125.119'
    text: the very very dense language that an
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '127'
    text: abstract or scientific papers typically
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '128.599'
    text: written in um and so then there will be
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '130.8'
    text: some like sort of like simple check boxy
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '132.76'
    text: style of canvas assignment and then like
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '135.48'
    text: a Discord server based conversation
  - dur: '9.56'
    start: '138.2'
    text: space there um and those will be
  - dur: '8.88'
    start: '141.68'
    text: ostensibly um do um next week so end of
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '147.76'
    text: next week meaning 11:59
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '150.56'
    text: p.m. on Sunday before the following
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '153.04'
    text: Monday and if you don&amp;#39;t hit that
  - dur: '6.159'
    start: '154.8'
    text: deadline there will be dire
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '156.72'
    text: consequences um not really but it&amp;#39;s sort
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '160.959'
    text: of we wanted to keep kind of in that
  - dur: '6.92'
    start: '163.28'
    text: General Cadence that the that we&amp;#39;re all
  - dur: '5.961'
    start: '165.879'
    text: kind of like on the same path
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '170.2'
    text: um
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '171.84'
    text: and
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '173.36'
    text: probably probably by the end of this
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '176.56'
    text: next week is when the I will have
  - dur: '3.04'
    start: '180.08'
    text: implemented the stuff where the bot will
  - dur: '3.319'
    start: '181.64'
    text: be kind of like keeping track of a
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '183.12'
    text: profile of your interests and trying to
  - dur: '7.2'
    start: '184.959'
    text: like help in the journey that you will
  - dur: '8.08'
    start: '187.4'
    text: take through this General field
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '192.159'
    text: um but we&amp;#39;ll see anytime I make a
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '195.48'
    text: promise about the future just know
  - dur: '2.68'
    start: '197.76'
    text: internally I am
  - dur: '3'
    start: '201.04'
    text: screaming
  - dur: '4'
    start: '207.239'
    text: um great
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '217.4'
    text: okay off up okay who cares
  - dur: '6.241'
    start: '227.799'
    text: um yes
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '230.799'
    text: okay let&amp;#39;s go ahead and get into
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '234.04'
    text: it
  - dur: '8.441'
    start: '236.599'
    text: um I know what to do
  - dur: '8.72'
    start: '240.28'
    text: methods I realized I forgot um Mo
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '245.04'
    text: cap tracking
  - dur: '3'
    start: '249'
    text: Etc
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '260.519'
    text: okay I also forgot a piece of equipment

    start: '263.32'
    text: that I intended to bring today uh so I
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '265.919'
    text: will use this instead
  - dur: '6'

    start: '301.88'
    text: this class kind of seeing you guys
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '303.68'

    text: bot about what you&amp;#39;re into and what you
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '309.88'
    text: want to study and things like that um
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '313.12'
    text: and I I intentionally wanted to have
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '316.4'
    text: that part happen first before I kind of
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '318.56'
    text: talk about my own talk too much about my

    start: '320.96'
    text: own
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '321.84'
    text: particular sort of map of this space um
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '325.319'
    text: because I I didn&amp;#39;t want
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '327.479'
    text: to uh
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '330.56'
    text: I wanted to let you guys kind of like
  - dur: '3.439'
    start: '332.6'
    text: think about it for yourselves before I
  - dur: '3.761'
    start: '334.479'
    text: came up and did like the like the
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '336.039'
    text: traditional Professor thing which is to
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '338.24'
    text: tell you here&amp;#39;s what this field is and
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '339.96'
    text: here&amp;#39;s what this means and here&amp;#39;s what
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '341.4'
    text: the here&amp;#39;s what is on topic here&amp;#39;s what
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '343.44'
    text: is off topic um because I generally
  - dur: '7.28'
    start: '345.88'
    text: don&amp;#39;t think that that&amp;#39;s how we should
  - dur: '7.679'
    start: '348.36'
    text: think about intellectual inquiry um and
  - dur: '7.84'
    start: '353.16'
    text: the next chunk of time I&amp;#39;m going to give
  - dur: '8.44'
    start: '356.039'
    text: you an overview of this domain of human
  - dur: '6.919'
    start: '361'
    text: centered Neuroscience um that is mostly
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '364.479'
    text: related to my own particular history my
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '367.919'
    text: own research background my own the
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '370.4'
    text: studies that I&amp;#39;ve done um and anytime
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '373.599'
    text: that you you know by the time that you
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '375.28'
    text: have sort of lived long enough to have
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '377.479'
    text: Specialties and personal experiences and
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '380.16'
    text: whatnot you will have sort of charted
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '382.24'
    text: your own path and trajectory Into the
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '384.72'
    text: Heart of some field or some domain um
  - dur: '4.521'
    start: '388.039'
    text: and for pretty much all of you you know
  - dur: '4.239'
    start: '390.8'
    text: for everyone that sort of chooses to
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '392.56'
    text: follow a route kind of like that um you
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '395.039'
    text: are going to have a sort of unique path
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '398.24'
    text: like everybody&amp;#39;s path is going to be
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '399.72'
    text: different and everybody&amp;#39;s sort of the
  - dur: '4.239'
    start: '402.36'
    text: the the topics that are relevant to
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '404.12'
    text: everybody&amp;#39;s interest will all will be
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '406.599'
    text: will be different um
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '409.8'
    text: so I don&amp;#39;t want to present this stuff in
  - dur: '4.479'
    start: '412.44'
    text: the sense that in a sense of saying here
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '415'
    text: is everything that matters here is
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '416.919'
    text: everything that is relevant to this
  - dur: '7'
    start: '418.599'
    text: topic um I I really want to keep it kind
  - dur: '6.721'
    start: '421.639'
    text: of on that like relatively personalized
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '425.599'
    text: Narrative of these are the topics that
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '428.36'
    text: are the most important for me to be able
  - dur: '5.481'
    start: '431.039'
    text: to study human human perceptual motor
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '434.56'
    text: Neuroscience in the ways that I
  - dur: '6.399'
    start: '436.52'
    text: specifically have learned how to do
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '439.4'
    text: um and sort of talking about that in
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '442.919'
    text: that Con in that context of like the the
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '446.12'
    text: the component pieces of my particular
  - dur: '6.961'
    start: '448.039'
    text: specialty um and I think the beauty of
  - dur: '7.079'
    start: '450.8'
    text: using sort of AI mediated Tools in a
  - dur: '5.759'
    start: '455'
    text: classroom setting is that in a
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '457.879'
    text: traditional class the professor kind of
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '460.759'
    text: like lays out the curriculum lays out
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '462.599'
    text: the structure lays out the topic area
  - dur: '5'
    start: '464.84'
    text: and then you are all kind of constrained
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '466.8'
    text: to follow that structure um and that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.759'
    start: '469.84'
    text: largely for practical reasons like it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '471.68'
    text: just it&amp;#39;s just too hard and it requires
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '473.599'
    text: too much human labor to like really
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '475.599'
    text: mediate and like sort of navigate the
  - dur: '5.919'
    start: '478.4'
    text: particular um sort of variations of
  - dur: '4.481'
    start: '481.479'
    text: interest of people in a room even even a
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '484.319'
    text: room that is labeled under a particular
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '485.96'
    text: course title um but I think with the AI
  - dur: '6'
    start: '489.72'
    text: you know limited though it may be it
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '492.72'
    text: will always do a do its damnedest to
  - dur: '6.599'
    start: '495.72'
    text: sort of make whatever your interests are
  - dur: '7.52'
    start: '498.44'
    text: relevant to the topics that I have
  - dur: '7.84'
    start: '502.319'
    text: mandated it should care about um so as I
  - dur: '7.68'
    start: '505.96'
    text: start going through this stuff uh just
  - dur: '6.841'
    start: '510.159'
    text: encouraging you to really learn to key
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '513.64'
    text: in to like your own personal feelings of
  - dur: '6.039'
    start: '517'
    text: interest in your own personal feelings
  - dur: '9.401'
    start: '518.839'
    text: of like being drawn or snagged or moved
  - dur: '6.841'
    start: '523.039'
    text: by some topic or some domain um and you
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '528.24'
    text: know if you want to follow the
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '529.88'
    text: trajectories that I&amp;#39;m doing that&amp;#39;s all
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '532.2'
    text: well and good but even if you wanted to
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '534.32'
    text: you wouldn&amp;#39;t it wouldn&amp;#39;t happen that way
  - dur: '7.36'
    start: '536.36'
    text: because that&amp;#39;s not how the world Works
  - dur: '8.24'
    start: '538.8'
    text: um and so as I give this sort of lecture
  - dur: '6'
    start: '543.72'
    text: um my main request for you is to just
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '547.04'
    text: not let your brain turn all the way off
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '549.72'
    text: I&amp;#39;m going to be talking fast about a lot
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '551.64'
    text: of sort of topics that are going to be
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '553.519'
    text: relatively unfamiliar um for some of
  - dur: '2.44'
    start: '555.92'
    text: them they might be the first time you&amp;#39;ve
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '557.32'
    text: heard about it for some of them you
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '558.36'
    text: might have heard about it before uh the
  - dur: '3.759'
    start: '561.64'
    text: goal is not to have you understand
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '563.959'
    text: everything that I&amp;#39;m saying the goal is
  - dur: '7.321'
    start: '565.399'
    text: to just expose you to it um so as I
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '568.64'
    text: start sort of blah blah bling at you
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '572.72'
    text: um don&amp;#39;t get too hung up on whether or
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '575.04'
    text: not you&amp;#39;re following everything just
  - dur: '4.519'
    start: '576.32'
    text: kind of like remember the words as much
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '578.2'
    text: as you can try to let just try to let it
  - dur: '7.921'
    start: '580.839'
    text: wash over you I promise you nonzero of
  - dur: '6.039'
    start: '584.92'
    text: it will be attaching um and then when we
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '588.76'
    text: kind of open things back up
  - dur: '5'
    start: '590.959'
    text: uh you can start asking the bot asking
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '594.16'
    text: your neighbors the questions about the
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '595.959'
    text: parts that were the most interesting to
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '597.72'
    text: you and the part that I have found the
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '600.079'
    text: most gratifying about doing this type of
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '602.04'
    text: a class is the Discovery every time
  - dur: '6.761'
    start: '604.959'
    text: empirically that when I give a lecture
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '607.88'
    text: on a given topic and then I say to 40
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '611.72'
    text: students ask the bot about the parts you
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '613.959'
    text: found most interesting typically what I
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '615.92'
    text: see from that is 40 different
  - dur: '6'
    start: '618.16'
    text: conversations about 40 different topics
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '620.48'
    text: and that&amp;#39;s really a lot of fun
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '624.16'
    text: um
  - dur: '8.479'
    start: '625.8'
    text: so with that said let us get get into it
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '630.72'
    text: um unfortunately
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '634.279'
    text: I I
  - dur: '7.08'
    start: '636.12'
    text: brought I intended to bring a um like a
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '639.92'
    text: tablet so I could like draw like stuff
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '643.2'
    text: with colors um and I brought the tablet
  - dur: '5.719'
    start: '645.68'
    text: but then when I looked for like the the
  - dur: '6.201'
    start: '647.279'
    text: pen part I found I just thrown like this
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '651.399'
    text: like standard pencil into here which I
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '653.48'
    text: can&amp;#39;t even I can&amp;#39;t even imagine what was
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '656.68'
    text: going on when I did that so we&amp;#39;re just
  - dur: '3.359'
    start: '659.6'
    text: doing we&amp;#39;re going to do it old school
  - dur: '3.081'
    start: '661.079'
    text: with unfortunately just a singular color
  - dur: '3.521'
    start: '662.959'
    text: but that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '7.72'
    start: '664.16'
    text: okay
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '666.48'
    text: um let&amp;#39;s see move over
  - dur: '3'
    start: '672.44'
    text: here
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '676.279'
    text: so was your
  - dur: '7.08'
    start: '680.72'
    text: fault how dare you okay I&amp;#39;ll just I&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '684.12'
    text: put it on your bill
  - dur: '6.921'
    start: '688.079'
    text: um um
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '691.12'
    text: um okay
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '695.72'
    text: so right so the topic of the course is
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '698.04'
    text: neuroscience the the department is
  - dur: '7.28'
    start: '699.92'
    text: biology and most of you as biology
  - dur: '7.16'
    start: '702.88'
    text: majors and whatnot have internalized to
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '707.2'
    text: some degree or another with validity
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '710.04'
    text: that biology and Neuroscience are things
  - dur: '8.24'
    start: '712.44'
    text: are is is Rel is related to things like
  - dur: '7.799'
    start: '714.72'
    text: cells and neurons and wet lab microscope
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '720.68'
    text: types of conversations and stuff like
  - dur: '7.721'
    start: '722.519'
    text: that super valid super good topics good
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '725.8'
    text: things to look at um and all kind of
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '730.24'
    text: part and parcel with a particular
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '732.92'
    text: philosophical tradition that is so
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '735.199'
    text: fundamental to the way that we do
  - dur: '7.521'
    start: '737.639'
    text: scientific research in
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '740.48'
    text: 2025 in Earth um that we often don&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '745.16'
    text: even think about it and that is the
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '746.32'
    text: concept of reductionism that&amp;#39;s not your
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '748.44'
    text: way
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '750.44'
    text: um so reductionism is just sort of a
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '752.16'
    text: general philosophical approach to the
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '755.36'
    text: study of the natural world um which
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '757.8'
    text: tries to break things down into smaller
  - dur: '3.721'
    start: '761.199'
    text: and smaller pieces so that with you can
  - dur: '2.8'
    start: '763.44'
    text: sort of make more and more precise
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '764.92'
    text: measurements and more more precise
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '766.24'
    text: topics more more precise investigations
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '768.6'
    text: but this kind of like sort of like
  - dur: '3.719'
    start: '770.92'
    text: implicit assumption that at some point
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '773.16'
    text: there will be that by looking at the
  - dur: '5.521'
    start: '774.639'
    text: component pieces of the world you&amp;#39;ll be
  - dur: '6.201'
    start: '777.279'
    text: able to get a sense of the istic view of
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '780.16'
    text: how everything works um and there&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '2.64'
    start: '783.48'
    text: lot of validity to that approach but
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '784.959'
    text: there&amp;#39;s also obviously a lot of
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '786.12'
    text: limitations to that um because if you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '788.839'
    text: only looking at the small pieces in
  - dur: '4.481'
    start: '790.839'
    text: isolation you never going to see or
  - dur: '4.241'
    start: '793.199'
    text: you&amp;#39;re going to have a hard time seeing
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '795.32'
    text: what we call emergent properties which
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '797.44'
    text: are things that only really come about
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '799.6'
    text: when you look at the the combination of
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '801.72'
    text: things at a larger scale than the kind
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '804.8'
    text: of things you can put into a test tube
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '806.6'
    text: and under a microscope um the classic
  - dur: '6.92'
    start: '809.24'
    text: example of emergence is traffic um so

    text: humans behaving in natural environments
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '873.72'
    text: doing um the kinds of stuff that we do
  - dur: '3.321'
    start: '876.839'
    text: in our sort of day-to-day lives so you
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '878.8'
    text: know like throwing things in the air and
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '880.16'
    text: catching them involves there&amp;#39;s a motor
  - dur: '6.039'

    text: marker an information gathering phase
  - dur: '3.281'
    start: '888.279'
    text: and then another motor command which if
  - dur: '5.44'

    text: it lines up with the

    start: '897.68'

  - dur: '6.639'
    start: '901.88'
    text: that behavioral process um in its
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '905.32'
    text: natural context and then trying to use
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '908.519'
    text: whatever the best measurements that I
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '910.72'
    text: can come up with um of those behaviors
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '913.92'
    text: and then trying to attach them to sort
  - dur: '5.761'
    start: '915.399'
    text: of the more low-level reductionist sort
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '917.56'
    text: of um fields of inquiry so that we can
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '921.16'
    text: have a sense of like you know how the
  - dur: '6.88'
    start: '923.399'
    text: things like cells and neurons can lead
  - dur: '5'
    start: '926.959'
    text: to complex behaviors like that so I
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '930.279'
    text: think of it as kind of like it&amp;#39;s almost
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '931.959'
    text: like a robotics approach so it&amp;#39;s I like
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '933.959'
    text: to tell people that I studi the part of
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '935.56'
    text: Neuroscience that overlaps with robotics
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '938.199'
    text: um because robotics is another field
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '941.399'
    text: that kind of like keeps you honest in
  - dur: '4'
    start: '943'
    text: the sense that it&amp;#39;s you make things that
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '945.36'
    text: move around in the real world so you
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '947'
    text: can&amp;#39;t really cut that many corners so
  - dur: '7.8'
    start: '948.88'
    text: the thing just stops working um and the
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '952.199'
    text: difference is that the like robots we
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '956.68'
    text: know how they work because we made them
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '958.12'
    text: but we they can&amp;#39;t do all the things we
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '960.279'
    text: want humans we don&amp;#39;t really know how
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '962.24'
    text: they work but they can do pretty much
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '963.759'
    text: anything so there&amp;#39;s this kind of
  - dur: '3.519'
    start: '965.8'
    text: combination of those two sort of
  - dur: '4.039'
    start: '967.6'
    text: thinking about the human as like a
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '969.319'
    text: magical meat robot and trying to study
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '971.639'
    text: it and understand it from the that
  - dur: '7.36'
    start: '974.44'
    text: perspective um can lead to a lot of
  - dur: '6.961'
    start: '977.399'
    text: useful results um and the nice thing
  - dur: '6.479'
    start: '981.8'
    text: about that is kind of the abstraction
  - dur: '5.959'
    start: '984.36'
    text: away from the biology and from the the
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '988.279'
    text: the knowledge that it is in fact under
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '990.319'
    text: the hood cells and neurons and you know
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '993.399'
    text: membrane potentials and things like that
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '995.68'
    text: um and thinking about it more in the
  - dur: '6.081'
    start: '997.839'
    text: terms of the things that we can measure
  - dur: '7.161'
    start: '999.839'
    text: um which we will talk about shortly
  - dur: '7.039'
    start: '1003.92'
    text: um so let&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '6.759'
    start: '1007'
    text: talk so speaking of the natural world
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '1010.959'
    text: let&amp;#39;s sort of talk about something
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '1013.759'
    text: which you know is one of the ways to
  - dur: '4.239'
    start: '1016.04'
    text: parse out that General topic which is
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '1018.36'
    text: what&amp;#39;s called the perception Action
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '1020.279'
    text: Cycle um
  - dur: '7.199'
    start: '1027.72'
    text: so let&amp;#39;s start by drawing a brain I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '1032.799'
    text: trying to draw
  - dur: '3.241'
    start: '1034.919'
    text: it I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '6.439'
    start: '1039'
    text: draw yes let&amp;#39;s do it like that um so
  - dur: '6.801'
    start: '1042.959'
    text: here&amp;#39;s how you draw a
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '1045.439'
    text: brain there you go
  - dur: '3'
    start: '1052.24'
    text: um
  - dur: '8'
    start: '1055.6'
    text: the sorry try and you&amp;#39;ll figure it out
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1060.08'
    text: okay so this is your brain this is a
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '1063.6'
    text: picture of your brain that&amp;#39;s your
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '1065.2'
    text: temporal lobe this is your eye you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '1067.88'
    text: facing that way
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '1071.44'
    text: um and there&amp;#39;s a lot of details that are
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1074.24'
    text: not being covered here but this is the
  - dur: '7.721'
    start: '1075.799'
    text: general shape so here you are that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '1079.12'
    text: your that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s you and you existence
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '1083.52'
    text: in the
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '1084.6'
    text: world
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '1086.84'
    text: and let&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '1094.28'
    text: see let&amp;#39;s do this different
  - dur: '8.12'
    start: '1102.36'
    text: way there you go that&amp;#39;s you you&amp;#39;re in
  - dur: '6.919'
    start: '1106'
    text: the world and here here&amp;#39;s your
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '1110.48'
    text: body here&amp;#39;s your eye here&amp;#39;s your mouth
  - dur: '7.081'
    start: '1112.919'
    text: and then inside of there that&amp;#39;s your
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '1115.159'
    text: brain not to scale and
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '1120.12'
    text: so as you are in the world you have a
  - dur: '7.24'
    start: '1124.72'
    text: very limited awareness
  - dur: '7.399'
    start: '1126.76'
    text: of of your given context and the
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '1131.96'
    text: everything that that you know comes in
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '1134.159'
    text: through your senses and well your senses
  - dur: '3.521'
    start: '1136.679'
    text: in your memory so let&amp;#39;s think about a
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1138.12'
    text: particular moment in time where you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '1140.2'
    text: sitting here you have your eye and then
  - dur: '2.84'
    start: '1143.24'
    text: you see out
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '1148.159'
    text: here there&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '1150.12'
    text: cat you like cats and so you so the
  - dur: '7.801'
    start: '1153.559'
    text: image so light from the sun bounces off
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '1156.88'
    text: the cat and goes into your eye and we&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '1161.36'
    text: talk a lot about eyes we&amp;#39;ll talk about
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1163.6'
    text: the lens we&amp;#39;ll talk about the retina
  - dur: '6.839'
    start: '1165.08'
    text: we&amp;#39;ll talk about the phobia we&amp;#39;ll talk
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '1168'
    text: about the optic nerve um but the most
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1171.919'
    text: the main thing is that
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '1174.6'
    text: their your eye is the place where
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '1176.679'
    text: environmental energy is first absorbed
  - dur: '6.919'
    start: '1179.64'
    text: by your nervous system and this
  - dur: '6.321'
    start: '1183.159'
    text: moment right here is a very special
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '1186.559'
    text: moment in your perceptual cycle which is
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '1189.48'
    text: the moment of
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '1190.72'
    text: transduction um which is the term for
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '1193.96'
    text: the moment when some form of
  - dur: '6.319'
    start: '1196.84'
    text: environmental energy in this case light
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '1199.84'
    text: has gets transduced and converted into
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '1203.159'
    text: neural activity in this particular case
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '1206.12'
    text: in
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '1207.32'
    text: your this is your eye the light goes in
  - dur: '2.88'
    start: '1212'
    text: it
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1212.88'
    text: goes into your
  - dur: '7.52'
    start: '1214.88'
    text: retina into your phobia which talk
  - dur: '6.279'
    start: '1217.88'
    text: plenty about um there&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '1222.4'
    text: particular
  - dur: '6.281'
    start: '1224.159'
    text: uh class
  - dur: '7.841'
    start: '1226.679'
    text: of molecule called opsin opsins look
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '1230.44'
    text: roughly like this this like you know um
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '1234.52'
    text: what are they called carbons and
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '1235.64'
    text: hydrogens and then the hexagon and then
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '1238.4'
    text: the long the long uh sort of Wiggly tail
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '1241.72'
    text: um the people in Biochemistry this is
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '1244.28'
    text: probably familiar shapes except this is
  - dur: '5.441'
    start: '1246.679'
    text: not drawn well and then you have a bunch
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '1248.88'
    text: of these opsins in your eye um and
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '1252.12'
    text: they&amp;#39;re all there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s basically
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '1254.2'
    text: three main ones and they&amp;#39;re sort of
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '1255.72'
    text: they&amp;#39;re all they they&amp;#39;re tuned if you
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '1258.88'
    text: want to use that term to different
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '1260.44'
    text: wavelengths of light and they the nature
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '1262.36'
    text: of them is that when a photon of light
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '1265.12'
    text: hits them they absorb the energy of that
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '1268.72'
    text: Photon and then change shape and I think
  - dur: '3.04'
    start: '1271.96'
    text: I actually did this backwards I think
  - dur: '3.441'
    start: '1273.159'
    text: they start out with the Kink and then
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '1275'
    text: when they absorb the light they
  - dur: '7.199'
    start: '1276.6'
    text: straighten out um but whatever happens
  - dur: '7.68'
    start: '1279.84'
    text: this absorption of a photon changes the
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '1283.799'
    text: electrochemical properties of the
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '1287.52'
    text: molecule and it goes from being a
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '1290.159'
    text: neutral to a plus one or a minus one or
  - dur: '5.239'
    start: '1292.44'
    text: whatever it is um but the point is that
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '1295.679'
    text: the the the light that is coming from
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1297.679'
    text: the environment bouncing off the cat
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '1300.12'
    text: entering your eye changing the chemical
  - dur: '5.721'
    start: '1302.799'
    text: layout of the opson um and happening in
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '1306.32'
    text: the trillions and billions of sort of
  - dur: '8.279'
    start: '1308.52'
    text: instances that biology tends to operate
  - dur: '8.48'
    start: '1310.6'
    text: in um this changes the polarity and the
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '1316.799'
    text: Electrical uh state
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '1319.08'
    text: of the rods and the cones in your retina
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '1322.4'
    text: which get sort of you know accumulated
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '1324.88'
    text: with ganglia and various sort of other
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '1327.48'
    text: stuff
  - dur: '6.479'
    start: '1329.08'
    text: um and leads to a shift in the uh
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1333.559'
    text: electrical potential in the in that
  - dur: '6.321'
    start: '1335.559'
    text: section of your retina that then gets
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '1337.799'
    text: sent in as spikes down your optic nerves
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '1341.88'
    text: neurons are the things that Neuroscience
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '1344.559'
    text: is made of and mostly what neurons do is
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '1347.08'

  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '1366.24'

    text: visual cortex
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '1394.4'
    text: um and so we&amp;#39;re going to talk more about
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '1397.44'
    text: this in more detail and more coherence
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '1400.039'
    text: um but the important thing here is that
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '1403.84'
    text: the light that has been absorbed by your
  - dur: '6.319'
    start: '1405.72'
    text: eye that is then gets converted through
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '1408.279'
    text: this strange biochemical machine into a

    start: '1412.039'
    text: pattern of neural
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '1413.799'
    text: activity uh because the neural activity
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '1417.44'
    text: is caused by the light and because the
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '1419.72'
    text: light has been reflected off the object
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '1421.72'
    text: in question there is a general belief
  - dur: '8.319'
    start: '1424.24'
    text: and assumption um that that the pattern
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '1428.84'
    text: of neural activity has somehow has some
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '1432.559'
    text: relationship with the object in the real
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '1434.64'
    text: world there&amp;#39;s some statistical
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '1436.039'
    text: correlation there&amp;#39;s some relationship
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '1438.12'
    text: and the pattern of neural activity
  - dur: '6.919'
    start: '1440.76'
    text: somehow encodes information about the
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '1443.48'
    text: world that you&amp;#39;re looking at um the
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '1447.679'
    text: nature of that relationship is tenuous
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '1450'
    text: and complex um and generally speaking
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '1454.159'
    text: extremely impoverished like the actual
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '1456.36'
    text: information we&amp;#39;re getting in any mo One
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '1457.96'
    text: Moment In Time is far less than you
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '1460.32'
    text: think it would be it&amp;#39;s a lot but the
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '1463.279'
    text: richness of your visual environment for
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '1465.12'
    text: example is very much an illusion based
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '1468.44'
    text: off of your brain&amp;#39;s ability to sort of
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '1470.08'
    text: Cobble together a lot of noisy
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '1472'
    text: information to give you something that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '1474.039'
    text: sort of accurate enough to move through
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '1476.44'
    text: the world but often in almost
  - dur: '7.4'
    start: '1479.36'
    text: exclusively designed sort of like after
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '1481.96'
    text: the fact um
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '1489.44'
    text: so that&amp;#39;s your brain again um it&amp;#39;s more
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '1492.919'
    text: like a ma brain but that&amp;#39;s fine so your
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '1495.2'
    text: optic so the light comes into your eye
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '1497.52'
    text: gets absorbed by the retina which is on
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '1499'
    text: the back of your eye sends a pattern of
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '1501.36'
    text: neural activity down your optic nerve um
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '1505.6'
    text: passes through some subcortical areas
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '1507.84'
    text: and the thalamus and stuff like that
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '1509.32'
    text: which we&amp;#39;ll talk not that much about
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '1511.44'
    text: that part but there is some stuff that
  - dur: '5.919'
    start: '1512.88'
    text: happens here um and then projects down
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '1516'
    text: to the occipital lobe which is otherwise
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '1518.799'
    text: known as the visual cortex which is in
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '1521.08'
    text: the back of your brain
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '1524.919'
    text: um not super important to know where it
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '1527.84'
    text: is but it&amp;#39;s just just kind of like one
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '1529.08'
    text: of those things like it&amp;#39;s like Vision
  - dur: '6.88'
    start: '1531.72'
    text: happens here for in the back for
  - dur: '3.441'
    start: '1535.159'
    text: whatever reason
  - dur: '7.28'
    start: '1539.399'
    text: um and so this is the place
  - dur: '6.481'
    start: '1542.399'
    text: where the first kind of like the first
  - dur: '3.401'
    start: '1546.679'
    text: pass of information about your visual
  - dur: '3.399'
    start: '1548.88'
    text: environment sort of starts to get
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '1550.08'
    text: computed and it&amp;#39;s mostly in the form of
  - dur: '6.921'
    start: '1552.279'
    text: like edges and dark patches light
  - dur: '6.679'
    start: '1555.48'
    text: patches you know and stuff like that and
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '1559.2'
    text: once you get from V1 which is primary
  - dur: '8.081'
    start: '1562.159'
    text: visual cortex it goes through other
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '1565.76'
    text: stages of processing that lead to sort
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '1570.24'
    text: of more and more
  - dur: '7.48'
    start: '1571.559'
    text: complex you know um structures to emerge
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '1575.44'
    text: so like you start with things like edges
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1579.039'
    text: and then if you have enough edges you
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1581.2'
    text: can get patches and if you get patches
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '1583.919'
    text: then you can get textures and if you get
  - dur: '6.959'
    start: '1585.44'
    text: textures you can get objects and
  - dur: '6.599'
    start: '1589.2'
    text: that sort of like each stage of visual
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '1592.399'
    text: processing Builds on the stage before um
  - dur: '3.441'
    start: '1595.799'
    text: to sort of eventually lead to the
  - dur: '2.839'
    start: '1597.96'
    text: ability to do things like object
  - dur: '3.559'
    start: '1599.24'
    text: recognition of like oh that thing out
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '1600.799'
    text: there is a cat there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '1602.799'
    text: conversation we can have about like like
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '1605.88'
    text: the the parts of that process that go
  - dur: '6.159'
    start: '1608.12'
    text: down this lobe which is your temporal
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '1610.799'
    text: lobe which is here um tends to be the
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '1614.279'
    text: sort of object space of like that&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '1616.919'
    text: desk that&amp;#39;s a computer um and then the
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '1620.679'
    text: part that we tend to care more about in
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '1623.159'
    text: this class is the part that goes up this
  - dur: '5.721'
    start: '1627.159'
    text: direction um which tends to be more in
  - dur: '6.321'
    start: '1629.919'
    text: tune of using that information to plan
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '1632.88'
    text: your movement out in the world
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '1636.24'
    text: um something that I haven&amp;#39;t said I think
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '1638.679'
    text: yet but probably but is something that
  - dur: '6.839'
    start: '1640.32'
    text: bear is repeating is obviously this is a
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '1643.279'
    text: cartoon this is a very abstracted
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '1647.159'
    text: simplified version of a story which if
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '1650.399'
    text: you wanted to tell the whole story you
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1652.12'
    text: would have to tell a thousand thousand
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '1654.52'
    text: stories of a thousand thousand humans in
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '1656.52'
    text: their Labs recording data getting a
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1658.96'
    text: bunch of numbers and then making up
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '1661.48'
    text: their own stories and the discussion
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '1662.96'
    text: sections of their own papers about what
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '1665.44'
    text: the different parts mean and then this
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '1667.88'
    text: kind of cartoonified story is the
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '1670.399'
    text: version that tends to make it into the
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '1672.159'
    text: textbooks that we T sort of communicate
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1674.76'
    text: back to you and sort of try to make
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '1676.12'
    text: sense out of any of it
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '1679'
    text: but I think it&amp;#39;s really important that
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '1681.2'
    text: we remember that this is not the real
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '1683.44'
    text: story this is the cartoon and the real
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '1686.36'
    text: story is something that we don&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '7.72'
    start: '1688.72'
    text: actually have access to there is no
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '1692.12'
    text: there&amp;#39;s no level like of of class where
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '1696.44'
    text: I can just give you the book that says
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '1698.24'
    text: here is what the visual cortex is
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '1700.519'
    text: actually doing the best I could ever do
  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '1702.799'
    text: is just to give you a record of all the
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '1704.559'
    text: empirical measurements that all the
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '1705.919'
    text: humans who have ever investigated this
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '1707.799'
    text: man to put together and then tell you
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '1709.96'
    text: the story that we have collectively
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1711.88'
    text: decided is the best story that we can
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1714'
    text: come up with for how we think this part
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '1716.76'
    text: of this lumpy pink thing inside of all
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1719'
    text: of our skulls is
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '1720.919'
    text: operating
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '1723.24'
    text: um but yeah but that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '6.199'
    start: '1728.32'
    text: not there is a gap an essential gap
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '1731.76'
    text: between epistemology which is our
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '1734.519'
    text: knowledge of things and metaphysics
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '1737'
    text: which is what actually exists uh and the
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '1740.399'
    text: two things never truly touch there is
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '1743.36'
    text: always going to be a difference between
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '1744.96'
    text: knowing something and what that thing
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '1747.2'
    text: actually is and in the history of
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '1750.159'
    text: science we have told many many many
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '1752.6'
    text: stories about what we think is going on
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '1755'
    text: in the world and in our bodies and in
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '1756.88'
    text: our goopy bits um and historically over
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '1761.44'
    text: time every single one of those stories
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '1763.12'
    text: on a long enough time scale is proven
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '1765.2'
    text: wrong in some sense everything we
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '1767.48'
    text: currently think think will eventually be
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '1769.48'
    text: proven wrong in some way or another um
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '1772.2'
    text: evidence for that being everything we&amp;#39;ve
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1774'
    text: ever thought up until this point has
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1775.6'
    text: been proven wrong in some way or another
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1778.24'
    text: um so as you think there&amp;#39;s something
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '1780.24'
    text: special about today that&amp;#39;s going to keep
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '1782.48'
    text: happening um indefinitely until the sun
  - dur: '5.479'
    start: '1785.44'
    text: burns out but the beauty of the
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '1787.72'
    text: scientific process in some sense is that
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '1790.919'
    text: we have this belief that even though
  - dur: '5.559'
    start: '1793'
    text: everything has been wrong there is a
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '1795.84'
    text: sense that each success of idea is less
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '1798.559'
    text: wrong than the one before it and less
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1801.919'
    text: wrong means that it allows us to make
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '1803.84'
    text: more precise predictions it allows us to
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '1806.799'
    text: heal sickness better it allows us to
  - dur: '5.721'
    start: '1808.919'
    text: build machines that do more exciting
  - dur: '5.439'
    start: '1811.24'
    text: things um sometimes those improvements
  - dur: '4.519'
    start: '1814.64'
    text: happen by completely throwing around
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '1816.679'
    text: throwing out philosophical sort of like
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '1819.159'
    text: base level beliefs about how certain
  - dur: '9.36'
    start: '1820.6'
    text: things work um but yeah it&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '1824.679'
    text: continuous process we&amp;#39;ll talk about it
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '1831.36'
    text: um yes
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '1835.24'
    text: so so here we are in this
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '1837.84'
    text: cycle you the light has bounced off the
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '1840.72'
    text: cat it&amp;#39;s hit your eye it&amp;#39;s been absorbed
  - dur: '6.919'
    start: '1842.88'
    text: it&amp;#39;s been transmitted back to your
  - dur: '7.161'
    start: '1845.559'
    text: visual cortex um you have identified
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '1849.799'
    text: that it&amp;#39;s a cat and you have a an
  - dur: '8.52'
    start: '1852.72'

    text: so this is the parietal lobe don&amp;#39;t worry
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '1864.84'
    text: about the parietal lobe it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s great
  - dur: '7.401'
    start: '1867.559'
    text: but you can worry about it if you want
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1870.2'
    text: um but the important sort
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '1877.039'
    text: of okay
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '1879.519'
    text: so this back here is your visual cortex
  - dur: '6.719'
    start: '1883.2'
    text: um this on the side here roughly
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '1886.039'
    text: speaking is your motor cortex
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '1891.559'
    text: and So eventually you start as you as
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '1894.12'
    text: you look in more and more pictures of
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '1895.279'
    text: the brain you will and you can look at
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1897.279'
    text: this directly the the the wrinkles and
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '1899.48'
    text: stuff on the brain are not random they
  - dur: '6.401'
    start: '1901.679'
    text: are conserved in the same sense that
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '1905.24'
    text: while every face that we have looks very
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '1908.08'
    text: different they generally have two eyes
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '1910.159'
    text: and a nose and a mouth and just in
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '1911.919'
    text: different kind of configurations the
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '1913.76'
    text: wrinkly stuff and the the crevices and
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '1916.24'
    text: bumps and stuff on her brain roughly the
  - dur: '3.439'
    start: '1918.08'
    text: same like if you were to crack open all
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1919.84'
    text: the brains in this room which I don&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '1921.519'
    text: recommend um you would find a lot of
  - dur: '7.439'
    start: '1924.24'
    text: Correspondence in where the the big um
  - dur: '7.081'
    start: '1927.679'
    text: creases and stuff come in um and I am
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '1931.679'
    text: not at the level of that anatomy where I
  - dur: '4.519'
    start: '1934.76'
    text: can name them off the top of my head um
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '1937'
    text: but I do recognize them in pictures and
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '1939.279'
    text: that&amp;#39;s how you can kind of it&amp;#39;s easy to
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1942.279'
    text: tell when someone is drawing a brain
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '1944.96'
    text: artistically versus when they&amp;#39;re looking
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '1946.679'
    text: at Anatomy because
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '1949.039'
    text: artists and whatnot often just say oh
  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '1950.84'
    text: yeah it&amp;#39;s a bunch of like pink wrinkles
  - dur: '3.481'
    start: '1952.279'
    text: and then you just sort of it&amp;#39;s like okay
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '1953.96'
    text: well that&amp;#39;s not that&amp;#39;s not actually how
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '1955.76'
    text: we do but anyways there&amp;#39;s a big one
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '1957.48'
    text: right in the mirror called the central
  - dur: '7.72'
    start: '1958.72'
    text: sulcus sulcus is like the crease part
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '1962.679'
    text: and on this side of that sulcus is the
  - dur: '6.239'
    start: '1966.44'
    text: somato sensory cortex somat sensation is
  - dur: '6.241'
    start: '1969.639'
    text: like basically touch like think that
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '1972.679'
    text: this type of sensation um and on that
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '1975.88'
    text: side is the motor cortex so the n
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '1978.039'
    text: sensory cortex and then the motor cortex
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '1980.48'
    text: and they tend to be paired
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '1983.399'
    text: and you can look up I&amp;#39;ll you we&amp;#39;ll look
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '1986.88'
    text: up the huny LI when we talk about the
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '1988.919'
    text: motor cortex
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1993.799'
    text: um but I kind of it&amp;#39;s It&amp;#39;s I enjoy this
  - dur: '3.719'
    start: '1997.44'
    text: distinction and kind of like there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '1998.919'
    text: these two sides of the brain where on
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '2001.159'
    text: this side of the brain it&amp;#39;s kind of like
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '2003.24'
    text: sensation and sort of the the perception
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '2006.12'
    text: of the world like visual aspects and
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '2008.32'
    text: this the sort of sensory aspects and
  - dur: '2.76'
    start: '2011'
    text: then on this side of the brain is where
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '2012.24'
    text: we start getting to like motor actions
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '2013.76'
    text: and movements and kind of the outgoing
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '2016.159'
    text: parts of things um and as we sort of
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '2018.6'
    text: keep going forward you eventually get
  - dur: '5.559'
    start: '2020'
    text: over here to the frontal loes um the
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2023.399'
    text: frontal lobe is like the big lumpy part
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '2025.559'
    text: in the front that&amp;#39;s the like the the the
  - dur: '7.521'
    start: '2027.919'
    text: most human part of the brain all Maman
  - dur: '6.601'
    start: '2031.399'
    text: brains are roughly the sort of same
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2035.44'
    text: anatomically they&amp;#39;re just very fun
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '2038'
    text: mirrored into different sort of shapes
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '2039.96'
    text: and sizes like you know rats have a much
  - dur: '6.281'
    start: '2042.279'
    text: more pronounced Factory bulb for smell
  - dur: '7.759'
    start: '2045.36'
    text: versus their visual cortex and the human
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '2048.56'
    text: brain has a has a lot of extra Anatomy
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '2053.119'
    text: on that frontal lobe area this is
  - dur: '3.2'
    start: '2055.28'
    text: thought to be kind of where decision
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '2056.879'
    text: making comes from this is where sort of
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '2058.48'
    text: like language kind of lives and often in
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '2061.44'
    text: it&amp;#39;s um referenced in
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '2064.56'
    text: uh like executive function so that the
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '2067.96'
    text: feeling of like deciding what you want
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '2070'
    text: to do this is also where like
  - dur: '3.879'
    start: '2072'
    text: metacognition happens so if you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '2073.599'
    text: having thoughts about your thoughts like
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '2075.879'
    text: oh yeah I&amp;#39;m angry right now like that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '2077.679'
    text: a that&amp;#39;s a frontal loby area and and
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '2080.919'
    text: just reiterating the point every time I
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '2083.28'
    text: point to a part of the brain and I say
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '2085.679'
    text: this is the part that does this thing a
  - dur: '6.199'
    start: '2087.96'
    text: little part of me inside is screaming
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '2091.52'
    text: and dying because none of this is how
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '2094.159'
    text: any of it that like that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '2096.159'
    text: cartoon that&amp;#39;s not how the real world is
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '2098.359'
    text: set up it&amp;#39;s much more complex than that
  - dur: '5.721'
    start: '2099.839'
    text: it&amp;#39;s much noisier than that but it&amp;#39;s if
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '2103.68'
    text: I say this is where executive function
  - dur: '3.039'
    start: '2105.56'
    text: happens and I point at the front of the
  - dur: '2.6'
    start: '2107.32'
    text: brain and then this is where Vision
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '2108.599'
    text: happens and I point at the back of the
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '2109.92'
    text: brain that statement is more true than
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '2112.44'
    text: if I switch those two things around so
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '2114.88'
    text: just it&amp;#39;s important to reiterate that
  - dur: '3.08'
    start: '2117.2'
    text: even though I am telling you these
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '2118.8'
    text: simplified stories these sort of
  - dur: '2.839'
    start: '2120.28'
    text: textbook level conversations about how
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '2121.96'
    text: the brain
  - dur: '5.521'
    start: '2123.119'
    text: is this is the stuff that if we come
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '2126.24'
    text: back to this class in 250 years we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '2128.64'
    text: going to be saying very very different
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '2130'
    text: things but we&amp;#39;ll probably still say
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '2131.76'
    text: something like the vision happens in the
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '2133.24'
    text: back and the cognition happens in the
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '2135.04'
    text: front anyways um from this frontal lobe
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2139.2'
    text: from the you get sort of the frontal
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '2141.28'
    text: area executive functions then you get
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '2143.72'
    text: your
  - dur: '7.64'
    start: '2144.64'
    text: premotor area and somewhere around here
  - dur: '7.199'
    start: '2147.92'
    text: is where volitions arise volition is
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2152.28'
    text: sort of same route as voluntary it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.521'
    start: '2155.119'
    text: like the things that you want to do so
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '2156.76'
    text: you see you see the the cat and you say
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '2158.64'
    text: I want to touch the cat here
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '2161.8'
    text: is the cat and look at me I&amp;#39;m touching
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '2165.76'
    text: it and that&amp;#39;s this is what I want to
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '2168.24'
    text: happen and
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '2170.319'
    text: so now you are in this state where
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '2173.079'
    text: here&amp;#39;s your body here here&amp;#39;s your hand
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '2176.119'
    text: there here&amp;#39;s this cat there and here&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '2179'
    text: this desire that I sure wish that my
  - dur: '6.321'
    start: '2180.839'
    text: hand part was on this cat part um and
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '2184.56'
    text: this sort of and now there&amp;#39;s a a gap
  - dur: '2.64'
    start: '2187.16'
    text: between
  - dur: '2.841'
    start: '2188.359'
    text: the way that the world is in your
  - dur: '2.68'
    start: '2189.8'
    text: perception and the way the world that
  - dur: '2.56'
    start: '2191.2'
    text: wish the way that you wish the world
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2192.48'
    text: would be which is that your hand was
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '2193.76'
    text: sort of touching this object okay so
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '2197'
    text: those volitions kind
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '2198.96'
    text: of meld
  - dur: '8.88'
    start: '2201.8'
    text: with uh the perceptual
  - dur: '7.92'
    start: '2205.04'
    text: experience and from this sort of alchemy
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '2210.68'
    text: emerges something resembling a motor
  - dur: '3.879'
    start: '2212.96'
    text: plan
  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '2214.88'
    text: um we&amp;#39;re going to I&amp;#39;m trying to stop
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '2216.839'
    text: myself from going to some of these
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '2218'
    text: details because I am going to have like
  - dur: '1.84'
    start: '2220.64'
    text: like we&amp;#39;re going to have a whole lecture
  - dur: '1.96'
    start: '2221.68'
    text: about the eye we&amp;#39;re going to have a
  - dur: '2.04'
    start: '2222.48'
    text: whole lecture about the motor cortex
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '2223.64'
    text: we&amp;#39;re going to talk about this in more
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '2224.52'
    text: detail I&amp;#39;m just giving the overview
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '2230.079'
    text: uh but
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '2232.52'
    text: um but yeah but this is where we would
  - dur: '3'
    start: '2234.92'
    text: call
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '2235.68'
    text: something the first time we start seeing
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '2237.92'
    text: something resembling a motor plan
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '2239.92'
    text: there&amp;#39;s a lot of times in the chats
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '2242.56'
    text: y&amp;#39;all have been having where you talk
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '2244.16'
    text: about things like muscle memory um which
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '2246.68'
    text: is the sort of muscle memory is kind of
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '2249.64'
    text: like the uh it&amp;#39;s a term we like to use
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '2252.52'
    text: it&amp;#39;s like a very standard human
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '2254.359'
    text: expression um but it&amp;#39;s also one of the
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '2256.96'
    text: things that like it doesn&amp;#39;t really exist
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '2259.48'
    text: in a physiological sense like your Mo
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '2261.359'
    text: your muscles don&amp;#39;t have memory they&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5.881'
    start: '2263.119'
    text: much simpler object which we will talk
  - dur: '6.281'
    start: '2265.599'
    text: about muscles too um usually what you
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '2269'
    text: mean when you say muscle memory is motor
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '2271.88'
    text: plan um and as you sort of work on
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '2275.52'
    text: something more and more and you get more
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '2276.92'
    text: expertise more experience that&amp;#39;s the
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '2279.599'
    text: that that what we tend to refer to as
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '2281.28'
    text: motor as muscle memory is really like
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '2283.72'
    text: the motor plans kind of becoming more
  - dur: '7.08'
    start: '2285.64'
    text: robust and more sort of locked in
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '2289.319'
    text: um and typically where a lot of that
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '2292.72'
    text: kind of motor planning takes place is
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '2294.72'
    text: not necessarily in the motor
  - dur: '3.879'
    start: '2297.48'
    text: cortex um but most of that starts
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '2299.64'
    text: happening
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '2301.359'
    text: in subcortical regions um so if you
  - dur: '3.359'
    start: '2305.48'
    text: think about a picture of the brain and
  - dur: '4.88'

  - dur: '6.96'

    text: like to I like to talk about this as
  - dur: '5.6'

  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '2334.319'
    text: of like the the bloom of the rose on the
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '2336.88'
    text: rose bush like when you think about the
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2339.72'

  - dur: '3.16'

    text: when you&amp;#39;re looking at a rose bush it
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '2344.2'
    text: makes a lot of sense that we tend to
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '2345.8'
    text: focus on the rose like the red thing
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '2348.359'
    text: with petals and that smells nice and we
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '2350'
    text: spend a lot of our time focusing on that
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '2352.2'
    text: part of the plant in for very good
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '2353.72'

  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '2355.56'
    text: back and look at it from a b botney
  - dur: '6.12'

    text: point of view it&amp;#39;s mostly Bush and just
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '2360.8'
    text: a little bit of row and I think that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '2364'
    text: it&amp;#39;s kind of the same with the way our
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '2366.64'
    text: cortex works
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '2368.28'
    text: um the majority of our central nervous
  - dur: '5.721'
    start: '2371.319'
    text: system is not in that cortex it&amp;#39;s in the
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '2373.96'
    text: subcortical regions and among my
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '2377.04'
    text: favorite of those subcortical regions is
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '2379'
    text: the cerebellum which it look sort of
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '2381.599'
    text: sits at this looks kind of like this
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '2383.04'
    text: fist shaped thing that sits right below
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '2385.119'
    text: your cortex when you look up pictures of
  - dur: '3.521'
    start: '2387.119'
    text: the brain online you&amp;#39;ll see the big pink
  - dur: '3.599'

    text: wrinkly thing you see this kind of more
  - dur: '5.439'
    start: '2390.64'
    text: dense sort of like grayish looking thing
  - dur: '6'
    start: '2392.839'
    text: underneath it um that&amp;#39;s your cerebellum
  - dur: '9.881'
    start: '2396.079'
    text: your cerebellum is a very complicated
  - dur: '9.361'
    start: '2398.839'
    text: Beast um it contains about 3.5 times as
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '2405.96'
    text: many neurons as the rest of your central
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '2408.2'
    text: nervous system combined um and that
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '2411.44'
    text: number is sort of strangely conserved
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '2413.48'
    text: across different animals like all
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '2415.04'
    text: animals mammals particular just because
  - dur: '5'
    start: '2417.4'
    text: I don&amp;#39;t know about the other guys um we
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '2420.28'
    text: all have cortex we all have cerebellum
  - dur: '4'
    start: '2422.4'
    text: we have very different brain to body
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '2424.04'
    text: ratios and different sort of proportions
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2426.4'
    text: there but in General however big your
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '2428.92'
    text: brain is whatever animal you are your
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '2430.92'
    text: cerebellum is has three and a half times
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '2433.119'
    text: as many neurons as the rest of your
  - dur: '5.519'
    start: '2436.8'
    text: cortex
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '2438.96'
    text: um which is one of those things like I I
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '2442.319'
    text: always sort of come back to that it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '2443.52'
    text: sort of like that just seems anytime you
  - dur: '3.04'
    start: '2445.96'
    text: find a number in nature that&amp;#39;s conserved
  - dur: '2.561'
    start: '2447.599'
    text: across a bunch of different stases it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.079'
    start: '2449'
    text: just kind of like that seems like an
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '2450.16'
    text: interesting thing I wish I knew more
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '2452.079'
    text: about it um so your
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '2455.319'
    text: cerebellum the part of the reason why
  - dur: '4.481'
    start: '2457.319'
    text: has so many more like neurons by by
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '2459.68'
    text: count is that the neurons in associated
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '2461.8'
    text: with it are teensy teensy tiny they are
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '2464.28'
    text: you have granual cells and you have
  - dur: '6.599'
    start: '2466.24'
    text: pingi cells
  - dur: '7.281'
    start: '2469.119'
    text: um which I W I&amp;#39;m going to look up
  - dur: '3.561'
    start: '2472.839'
    text: pictures this because
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '2476.76'
    text: ah uh
  - dur: '3'
    start: '2478.48'
    text: Peri
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '2481.52'
    text: cells oh do I have internet here
  - dur: '10.921'
    start: '2491.079'
    text: yeah yeah preni cells in your cerebellum
  - dur: '7.2'
    start: '2497.68'
    text: are like one of the more beautiful parts
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '2502'
    text: of the nervous of your of your brain
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '2504.88'
    text: it&amp;#39;s kind of you have the cell body you
  - dur: '6.081'
    start: '2507.079'
    text: have the axon and then these are all the
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '2510.72'
    text: synapses and all of there&amp;#39;s thousands
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '2513.16'
    text: upon thousands of them um this picture
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '2515.56'
    text: is famous this was actually taken by
  - dur: '6.601'
    start: '2518.119'
    text: not picture but it&amp;#39;s um this is from
  - dur: '7.48'
    start: '2520.359'
    text: pinji the guy who sort of like he he
  - dur: '7.119'
    start: '2524.72'
    text: created was it oh sorry kahal uh says
  - dur: '8'
    start: '2527.839'
    text: right there um Ramon kahal
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '2531.839'
    text: who yeah um was part of the sort of
  - dur: '3.201'
    start: '2535.839'
    text: group
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '2537'
    text: that came up with the staining
  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '2539.04'
    text: mechanisms that allowed us to sort of
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '2540.599'
    text: start looking at neurons in their
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '2542.16'
    text: isolation that happened in roughly 1909
  - dur: '3'
    start: '2544.76'
    text: before that we didn&amp;#39;t really know what
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '2546.359'
    text: neurons were and didn&amp;#39;t know if they
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '2547.76'
    text: were just one big mass or if they were
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '2550.16'
    text: individualized pieces and there was like
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '2551.8'
    text: a big scientific and philosophical
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '2554.24'
    text: debate about are neur is is the brain
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '2556.96'
    text: all one big connected piece or did the
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '2559.559'
    text: like do the do the neurons touch or are
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '2561.92'
    text: they separated from each other and there
  - dur: '3.879'
    start: '2565.2'
    text: was Ramon Cal who was arguing in the
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '2567.24'
    text: favor of the synapse Doctrine which said
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '2569.079'
    text: that there was a gap between them and
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '2570.92'
    text: then there I think it was GOI who was
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '2572.68'
    text: arguing in favor of their it&amp;#39;s all
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '2574.96'
    text: touching whatever that was called and
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '2577.76'
    text: then um GOI came up with like a silver
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '2581.44'
    text: nitrate staining process that allowed
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '2584.16'
    text: them to make images like this of looking
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '2586.64'
    text: at cells and
  - dur: '5.881'
    start: '2589.319'
    text: ironically by making that staining
  - dur: '6.321'
    start: '2591.559'
    text: process prove the Cal side of that
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '2595.2'
    text: argument correct and that they tend not
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '2597.88'
    text: to touch and then they both got both
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '2600.72'
    text: Ramon Cal and GOI got they shared a
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '2603.44'
    text: Nobel Prize but apparently they had such
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '2606.119'
    text: bad blood between them that they both
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '2607.8'
    text: spent their entire speech bashing the
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '2609.76'
    text: other guy um so there you go there you
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '2612.76'
    text: got that
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '2614.4'
    text: um but yeah so
  - dur: '7.76'
    start: '2618.319'
    text: your so your cerebellum is consists of
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '2621.119'
    text: preni cells and then granu
  - dur: '7'
    start: '2626.559'
    text: cells
  - dur: '7.801'
    start: '2628.119'
    text: which in comparison look more like this
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2633.559'
    text: they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re small and they don&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '2635.92'
    text: have these super long fibers that sort
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '2638.079'
    text: of go very long distances they&amp;#39;re much
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '2640.839'
    text: more localized they only connect to
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '2642.48'
    text: their immediate neighbors um and the
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '2645.559'
    text: majority of ner of of neurons in your
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '2648.4'
    text: nervous system are these granular cells
  - dur: '7.44'
    start: '2650.48'
    text: that live in your cerebellum your
  - dur: '7.2'
    start: '2653.2'
    text: cerebellum is a layered thing
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '2657.92'
    text: um like most parts of your brain it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '6.679'
    start: '2660.4'
    text: got kind of like
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '2663.8'
    text: um like the layers tend to operate phog
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '2667.079'
    text: gentically so that on the outside is the
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '2668.88'
    text: newest stuff on the inside is the older
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '2671.16'
    text: stuff um sellum has that structure we
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '2675.2'
    text: may talk about it I&amp;#39;m not sure uh we&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '2677.2'
    text: see it&amp;#39;s one of those things like if
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '2678.8'
    text: enough people talk to the bot and ask
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '2680.48'
    text: about this then I might like I&amp;#39;ll be
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2682.599'
    text: I&amp;#39;ll be trying to steer the lectures
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '2683.8'
    text: based off the interest of the class um
  - dur: '6.641'
    start: '2687.119'
    text: but anyway we&amp;#39;re talking about cats um
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '2690.52'
    text: so light hit the cat hit your eye
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '2693.76'
    text: absorbed in your retina tweaked your
  - dur: '8.44'
    start: '2696.2'
    text: opsins triggered a neural
  - dur: '6'
    start: '2700.52'
    text: Cascade vibrated your visual cortex uh
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '2704.64'
    text: gave you the perception of a cat your
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2706.52'
    text: volitional desire to touch the cat
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '2709.319'
    text: combined with the knowledge that there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '2711'
    text: a cat in front of you and started
  - dur: '5.521'
    start: '2714.119'
    text: creating a motor plan which sort of you
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '2716.839'
    text: know this is where the cartoon gets
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '2719.64'
    text: really cartoony because it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '2721.4'
    text: like there&amp;#39;s a lot of controversy about
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2723.52'
    text: like the different steps of this process
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '2725.359'
    text: but long story short something in the
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '2728'
    text: com combination of your motor cortex and
  - dur: '3.881'
    start: '2730.839'
    text: your cerebellum which is your cerebellum
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '2732.72'
    text: is largely like a motor based thing like
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '2734.72'
    text: a movement it mostly deals with movement
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '2737.48'
    text: of your body um it&amp;#39;s thought to be
  - dur: '6.561'
    start: '2739.319'
    text: related to like tool use um so this this
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '2743.119'
    text: thing that we humans can do where we
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '2745.88'
    text: pick up an object and kind of pretty
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '2747.48'
    text: quickly learn the physics of it um and
  - dur: '4.481'
    start: '2751.559'
    text: using it as a tool that has certain sort
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '2753.64'
    text: of characteristics is thought to be like
  - dur: '7.24'
    start: '2756.04'
    text: a neoc thing the Neo is the new part
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '2758.839'
    text: it&amp;#39;s on the outside it&amp;#39;s complicated um
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '2763.28'
    text: but there&amp;#39;s a level there&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '2765.559'
    text: hierarchical nature of your motor system
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '2768.2'
    text: where at the at the higher levels where
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '2771.319'
    text: the top is pretty much like the frontal
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '2773.559'
    text: lobe the the the plans are much more
  - dur: '7.081'
    start: '2776.359'
    text: abstract so it&amp;#39;s things like I&amp;#39;m thirsty
  - dur: '6.441'
    start: '2780.599'
    text: um I want I wish I was drinking water
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '2783.44'
    text: right now uh and then in order for that
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '2787.04'
    text: high level volition to be turned into
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '2788.92'
    text: something that can actually sort of lead
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '2791.2'
    text: me to my goal there has to be this sort
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '2793.76'

  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '2797.24'
    text: from that very high level volition uh
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '2800.2'
    text: down to something which at some level is
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '2802.88'
    text: going to have to boil down to muscle fir
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '2805.559'
    text: rings to move my body through space and
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '2808.16'
    text: so as I say oh I wish I had water I see
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '2810.52'
    text: that there&amp;#39;s water over there and
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '2812.2'
    text: somehow that volition is converted into
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '2814.96'
    text: motor commands that move my legs so now
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '2817.319'
    text: my body is in a place that I can move my
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '2818.92'
    text: arm I know how this thing works so I
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '2820.96'
    text: open the
  - dur: '6.839'
    start: '2822.48'
    text: thing and I get to drink water
  - dur: '6.68'
    start: '2827.04'
    text: um and
  - dur: '6.721'
    start: '2829.319'
    text: so that process tends to go you know
  - dur: '6.639'
    start: '2833.72'
    text: from the motor cortex then you got the
  - dur: '7.2'
    start: '2836.04'
    text: cerebellum then your cerebellum sort of
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '2840.359'
    text: has connections to your brain stem I say
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '2843.24'
    text: connections but they&amp;#39;re really kind of
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '2844.16'
    text: like they&amp;#39;re wrapped around each other
  - dur: '2.72'
    start: '2846.48'
    text: um
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '2847.72'
    text: so you have your brain stem your medulla
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '2849.2'
    text: oblongata your ponds um that&amp;#39;s the part
  - dur: '4'
    start: '2853'
    text: of your brain people talk about your
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '2854.319'
    text: Reptilian Brain that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that part
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '2857'
    text: that&amp;#39;s the part that handles things like
  - dur: '5.959'
    start: '2860.16'
    text: is my heart beating am I breathing is my
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '2863.72'
    text: temperature within a livable range that
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '2866.119'
    text: tends to be hanging out and controlled
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '2868.04'
    text: at your brain stem um and your brain
  - dur: '8.359'
    start: '2871.2'
    text: stem is the start of
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '2873.96'
    text: your spinal cord which is another good
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '2880.72'
    text: friend there we go there you
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '2885.52'
    text: go there you
  - dur: '10.76'
    start: '2894.88'
    text: perfect nice still you good job
  - dur: '8.159'
    start: '2900.2'
    text: um and so your spinal cord is a part of
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '2905.64'
    text: your central nervous system often times
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '2908.359'
    text: when we think about the spinal cord it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '2910.079'
    text: often kind of it&amp;#39;s It&amp;#39;s given a bad W
  - dur: '3'
    start: '2913.16'
    text: and we tend even when we look at
  - dur: '3.481'
    start: '2914.319'
    text: pictures of like if you Google pictures
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '2916.16'
    text: of the central nervous system you&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '2917.8'
    text: often see pictures that stop here and
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '2919.76'
    text: it&amp;#39;s just sort of like you know cortico
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '2922.92'
    text: centrism sort of just focused on that
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '2924.92'
    text: that rose on the bush and then less to
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '2927.599'
    text: say about you the cerebellum often gets
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '2930'
    text: in the picture but we often like cut off
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '2932.359'
    text: where the spine is um but your spine is
  - dur: '3.439'
    start: '2935.64'
    text: just as much a part of your nervous
  - dur: '3.359'
    start: '2937.2'
    text: system as the rest of it and the
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '2939.079'
    text: specifically the way that we&amp;#39;re going to
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '2940.559'
    text: Define central nervous system as opposed
  - dur: '6.439'
    start: '2942.92'
    text: to peripheral nervous system is uh
  - dur: '6.281'
    start: '2946.599'
    text: Loosely that the central nervous system
  - dur: '7.561'
    start: '2949.359'
    text: is where processing happens um where
  - dur: '7.4'
    start: '2952.88'
    text: processing is a very goopy term um that
  - dur: '7'
    start: '2956.92'
    text: basically means like information is
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '2960.28'
    text: coming in being some sort of conversion
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '2963.92'
    text: is happening which we might call a
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '2965.16'
    text: computation if we wanted to use like a
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '2967.48'
    text: computer analogy
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '2970.119'
    text: um but it information comes in changes
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '2973.52'
    text: form in some way and then information
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '2975.48'
    text: goes out um
  - dur: '6.119'
    start: '2979.24'
    text: and
  - dur: '8.039'
    start: '2981.04'
    text: the and you&amp;#39;re and the the spine is
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '2985.359'
    text: doing that kind of of processing um at
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '2989.079'
    text: various levels which we will also talk
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '2990.96'
    text: about let me see how we are on time okay
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '2993.96'
    text: on time um
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '2996.88'
    text: but it&amp;#39;s in very find it kind of
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '2998.52'
    text: fascinating ways and there are some
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '3001.48'
    text: stories that we will talk about later in
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '3003.64'
    text: the semester of studies that we aren&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '6.68'
    start: '3007.04'
    text: allowed to do anymore um on cats where
  - dur: '6.119'
    start: '3010.24'
    text: you can sever the spine like like cut
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '3013.72'
    text: the spine so it no longer connects to
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '3016.359'
    text: the upper part of the brain um and the
  - dur: '6.319'
    start: '3019.52'
    text: cat can still do things like walk um
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '3022.2'
    text: because the spine is is housing the the
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '3025.839'
    text: gray matter that that does that handles
  - dur: '5.519'
    start: '3028.28'
    text: things like Central pattern generation
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '3030.4'
    text: and reflex responses um or something
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '3033.799'
    text: like a central pattern generator is a
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '3035.359'
    text: thing that handles like the basic
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '3037.76'
    text: rhythmic motion of my legs and the thing
  - dur: '3.121'
    start: '3040.319'
    text: that says oh well one foot is going to
  - dur: '2.321'
    start: '3042.319'
    text: be in stance and the other one&amp;#39;s going
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '3043.44'
    text: to be in swing and then they&amp;#39;re going to
  - dur: '5.919'
    start: '3044.64'
    text: sort of swap off um and a lot of that
  - dur: '5.041'
    start: '3047.839'
    text: processing is handled in the spine
  - dur: '6.601'
    start: '3050.559'
    text: itself
  - dur: '6.8'
    start: '3052.88'
    text: um your spine goes down your spinal cord
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '3057.16'
    text: ends actually around here like right
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '3059.68'
    text: below your thoracic spine I know right
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '3063'
    text: um and then the stuff below that is
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '3064.92'
    text: what&amp;#39;s called like the cotus aquinus
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '3067.2'
    text: which is like that&amp;#39;s where it does
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '3069.319'
    text: become more um extension Cordy like and
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '3072.44'
    text: you you start to lose the gray matter
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '3074.28'
    text: and you get the more just like the
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '3076.079'
    text: peripheral nerves that go out to your
  - dur: '7.56'
    start: '3079.44'
    text: limbs
  - dur: '6.201'
    start: '3082.319'
    text: um yeah the yeah so the peripheral so I
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '3087'
    text: also just want to just again make that
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '3088.52'
    text: point that that distinction between
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '3090.48'
    text: central nervous system and peripheral
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '3092.48'
    text: nervous system is the kind of thing that
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '3094.4'
    text: is often stated as like this is a hard
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '3096.92'
    text: delineation um but there&amp;#39;s a lot of gray
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '3100'
    text: area there one of the most classic gray
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '3102.68'
    text: areas is the retina um the retina has a
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '3106.16'
    text: lot of neurons on the back of it and
  - dur: '5.961'
    start: '3108.079'
    text: there&amp;#39;s layers to it and it&amp;#39;s often
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '3111.92'
    text: described like we think about the retina
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '3114.04'
    text: like the eye sort of like the classical
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '3116.76'
    text: sensory organ um but there&amp;#39;s stuff
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '3119.079'
    text: happening on the back of the retina
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3121.16'
    text: before anything even leaves on on that
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '3124.28'
    text: optic nerve pass to the brain that
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '3126.16'
    text: really could be considered to be
  - dur: '7.28'
    start: '3128.16'
    text: computation um similarly your skin has a
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '3131.24'
    text: lot of connections in it that you know
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '3135.44'
    text: might be doing things that we might
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '3136.599'
    text: consider computation um that&amp;#39;s why like
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '3139.24'
    text: when you get hurt if you like rub rub
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '3141.4'
    text: the thing it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt as much
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '3143.2'
    text: because the ACT the activity of
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '3145.88'
    text: activating sensory organs around the
  - dur: '4.479'
    start: '3147.88'
    text: damaged area suppresses the feeling
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '3150.599'
    text: coming from the damaged area and that is
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '3152.359'
    text: all happening at the level of your skin
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '3155.359'
    text: um so just again this this these these
  - dur: '6'
    start: '3158.52'
    text: names and terms and whatnot this is not
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '3162.319'
    text: like nature is not
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '3164.52'
    text: design divided into pieces with
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '3167.96'
    text: departments and names that&amp;#39;s a thing
  - dur: '3.879'
    start: '3169.96'
    text: that we humans did to Nature so that we
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3172.079'
    text: could have any hope of making any sense
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '3173.839'
    text: of it but anytime we put a name or a
  - dur: '5.441'
    start: '3176.079'
    text: label or or a category into nature we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '3179.44'
    text: always going to be making concessions
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '3181.52'
    text: and sort of we&amp;#39;re drawing lines around
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '3183.88'
    text: areas because it allows us to have
  - dur: '2.76'
    start: '3185.68'
    text: better conversations about those things
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '3187.16'
    text: but there&amp;#39;s always going to be gray
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '3188.44'
    text: areas and often times it&amp;#39;s those gray
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '3190.319'
    text: areas or the cracks that the that tend
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '3192.88'
    text: to lead us to abandon certain thoughts
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '3195.16'
    text: and go towards
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '3196.44'
    text: others
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '3199.4'
    text: um okay so speaking of the peripheral
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '3202.799'
    text: nervous
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3204'
    text: system um
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '3208.52'
    text: so where I wish had colors
  - dur: '3.321'
    start: '3216.839'
    text: uh there you
  - dur: '6'
    start: '3226.76'
    text: go okay this is your arm that&amp;#39;s these
  - dur: '7.321'
    start: '3230.599'
    text: are your bones and your
  - dur: '6.68'
    start: '3232.76'
    text: bones are mostly what you are like if
  - dur: '3.439'
    start: '3237.92'
    text: we&amp;#39;re thinking about it in terms of like
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '3239.44'
    text: the space that you inhabit like the
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '3241.359'
    text: shape that you are your general sort of
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '3243.92'
    text: ability to move through the world it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '3245.92'
    text: mostly bones um and then all the goop
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '3248.4'
    text: that&amp;#39;s associated with that is sort of
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '3250.96'
    text: the details but the General cookie
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '3252.68'
    text: cutter shape of you as a as a creature
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '3255.28'
    text: is driven by these weird sticks and
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '3257.96'
    text: these weird sticks have weird things
  - dur: '7.2'
    start: '3260.48'
    text: attached to them called
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3263.68'
    text: muscles um
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '3270.599'
    text: and yeah and
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '3273.44'
    text: So eventually one of the things that
  - dur: '3.401'
    start: '3276.079'
    text: happens when you thinking about the sort
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '3277.839'
    text: of like more holistic picture of the
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '3279.48'
    text: world and sort of
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '3282'
    text: the way that you live in it
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '3285.319'
    text: um
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '3287.96'
    text: is be if you&amp;#39;re in a lab if you&amp;#39;re if
  - dur: '3.319'
    start: '3291.24'
    text: you&amp;#39;re living this reductionist life
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '3293.079'
    text: where you&amp;#39;re choosing a particular
  - dur: '4.481'
    start: '3294.559'
    text: domain of inquiry um and you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '3297.119'
    text: sort of simplifying and cutting out any
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '3299.04'
    text: extraneous factors that get in your way
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '3300.839'
    text: to to sort of zoom in as far as you can
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '3302.96'
    text: on that particular thing um you get to
  - dur: '4.079'

    text: about the perceptual aspects of that you

    start: '3345.88'
    text: are sort of required by the nature of
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '3348.68'
    text: reality to consider things like bones
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '3351'
    text: and muscles even though those are not
  - dur: '6.919'

    text: when we move when when our all this

    text: that moves the body through the world
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '3367.799'
    text: and this is where we get to the kind of
  - dur: '5.959'
    start: '3368.88'
    text: the robotics y conversation because um
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '3373.4'
    text: this is the part where the neural
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '3374.839'
    text: activity which has been originally
  - dur: '8.2'
    start: '3377.24'
    text: transduced into this sensory experience
  - dur: '7.64'
    start: '3379.64'
    text: of of vision um all of that sort of
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '3385.44'
    text: combination of things is eventually
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '3387.28'
    text: going to get boiled down here to
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '3389.599'
    text: something that sort of flips that coin
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '3392.079'
    text: around and now the neural activity is
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3394.319'
    text: going to be converted into environmental
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '3396.039'
    text: energy in this case in the form of
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '3398.319'
    text: mechanical energy so it&amp;#39;s going to
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '3401.119'
    text: squeeze my muscle and my arm is going to
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '3402.839'
    text: move that muscle my arm is going to be
  - dur: '6.559'
    start: '3404.76'
    text: move and this is now has there&amp;#39;s an
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '3408.24'
    text: there&amp;#39;s literal like energy in this
  - dur: '6.201'
    start: '3411.319'
    text: movement specifically in the form of
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '3413.92'
    text: kinetic energy or you know you know if
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '3417.52'
    text: I&amp;#39;m pulling on a spring or something
  - dur: '3.359'
    start: '3419.44'
    text: like that might be mechanical energy
  - dur: '3.441'
    start: '3421.319'
    text: like potential energy kinetic energy
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '3422.799'
    text: spring energy that&amp;#39;s the stuff that we
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '3424.76'
    text: get from our muscles and so there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '3426.76'
    text: that&amp;#39;s the whole perception action cycle
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '3428.359'
    text: is this conversion of environmental
  - dur: '7.159'
    start: '3430.64'
    text: energy into perceptual neural activity
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '3434.839'
    text: down back into a motor
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3437.799'
    text: action and so your
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '3439.96'
    text: muscles are
  - dur: '7.401'
    start: '3441.799'
    text: weird objects um and a muscle is
  - dur: '6.121'
    start: '3445.599'
    text: effectively a variable stiffness spring
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '3449.2'
    text: that&amp;#39;s pretty much what a muscle is
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '3451.72'
    text: muscles only pull your muscle can only
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '3455.52'
    text: pull on things muscles cannot push if
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '3458.76'
    text: when I when it looks like I&amp;#39;m pushing
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '3460.92'
    text: it&amp;#39;s because this muscle is pulling on
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '3462.839'
    text: the tip of that bone so that my arm goes
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '3465.44'
    text: that way and that that&amp;#39;s called
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '3467.44'
    text: extension and then if I want to squeeze
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '3469.48'
    text: this one then I send a motor command
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '3472.52'
    text: down there it fires the motor tendon
  - dur: '6.119'
    start: '3475.44'
    text: Union GGI body
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '3478.64'
    text: organs and it says Hey surrounding
  - dur: '6.361'
    start: '3481.559'
    text: muscle tissue contract and so this what
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '3485.68'
    text: was originally a fairly Wiggly Soft
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '3487.92'
    text: Spring gets electrified and becomes a
  - dur: '7.24'
    start: '3490.079'
    text: rather stiff spring and pulls this joint
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '3493.559'
    text: up and this one there&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re paired
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '3497.319'
    text: there&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '3498.44'
    text: flexion uh muscle group and then there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '3501.28'
    text: the extension muscle group and those two
  - dur: '8.681'
    start: '3503.559'
    text: things operate in conjunction to to move
  - dur: '9.44'
    start: '3507.44'
    text: this degree of freedom and that type
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '3512.24'
    text: of so yeah and so
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '3517.88'
    text: that so the motor plan that comes down
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '3521.039'
    text: from the motor cortex and sort of
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '3522.64'
    text: through the cerebellum if you&amp;#39;re a fancy
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3525.319'
    text: type of an animal like a human it goes
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '3527.52'
    text: through the corticos spinal tract which
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '3529.319'
    text: goes there is a sort of connection
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '3531.96'
    text: straight from your motor cortex down to
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '3533.48'
    text: your spine bypassing things like your
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '3535.44'
    text: cerebellum
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '3537.079'
    text: all animals have a cortical spinal tract
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '3539.16'
    text: but it&amp;#39;s really um but not to equal
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '3542.76'
    text: degree um and that&amp;#39;s one of the
  - dur: '2.8'
    start: '3544.44'
    text: interesting distinctions in the animal
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '3545.92'
    text: kingdom is
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '3547.24'
    text: like this is a fun this is one of my
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '3549.4'
    text: favorite I actually use this question to
  - dur: '6.321'
    start: '3551.839'
    text: test like AI models to see how it does
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '3554.92'
    text: at Neuroscience is asking about the
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '3558.16'
    text: cortical spinal tract and how it varies
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '3559.88'
    text: across the animal kingdom because that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '3561.88'
    text: one of the places where the questions
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '3564.24'
    text: get really subtle um and so I can look
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '3567.52'
    text: at how it does at that answer to see
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '3569.44'
    text: like I&amp;#39;m looking at like a local model I
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '3570.92'
    text: can run on my computer like the small
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '3573'
    text: ones I I can watch it get the subtle
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '3575.64'
    text: Parts wrong when I ask it that kind of a
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '3577.4'
    text: question so but a lot of stuff I&amp;#39;ve been
  - dur: '3.239'
    start: '3579.88'
    text: talking about about how like motor
  - dur: '3.399'
    start: '3581.16'
    text: cortex motor commands go through like
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '3583.119'
    text: the cerebellum and the brain stem and
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '3584.559'
    text: stuff like that that is true um but
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '3587.16'
    text: there is also this cortico spinal tract
  - dur: '3.399'
    start: '3589.68'
    text: anytime you see one of those big words
  - dur: '7.24'
    start: '3591.2'
    text: with an o in the middle just replace the
  - dur: '7.48'
    start: '3593.079'
    text: o with a slash so cortico spinal is C
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '3598.44'
    text: cortex SL
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '3600.559'
    text: spinal that just basically go straight
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '3602.52'
    text: from the cortex down to the spine
  - dur: '7.919'
    start: '3604.2'
    text: bypassing all the subcortical
  - dur: '8.521'
    start: '3606.119'
    text: regions um and it&amp;#39;s what allows us to be
  - dur: '6.361'
    start: '3612.119'
    text: to control our individual degrees of
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '3614.64'
    text: freedom of our body directly um as
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '3618.48'
    text: opposed to doing things in like it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '3620.68'
    text: more synergistic way which
  - dur: '3.881'
    start: '3622.559'
    text: is way deeper than I want to talk about
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '3624.72'
    text: in this particular lecture cheing that
  - dur: '6'
    start: '3626.44'
    text: clock it&amp;#39;s killing me um so yeah so here
  - dur: '7.2'
    start: '3630.119'
    text: I am I&amp;#39;m so close I&amp;#39;m so ready to almost
  - dur: '7.52'
    start: '3632.44'
    text: touch this cat um and I my motor my
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3637.319'
    text: motor plan which has come down from on
  - dur: '6.399'
    start: '3639.96'
    text: high down this sort of hierarchical
  - dur: '7.881'
    start: '3642.319'
    text: structure of our motor system has uh
  - dur: '7'
    start: '3646.359'
    text: taken my awareness of the world and my
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '3650.2'
    text: own body so the vision gives me
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '3653.359'
    text: information about remote parts of the
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '3655.16'
    text: world things I can not touch things that
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '3657.2'
    text: are outside of mine here&amp;#39;s a great word
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '3659.359'
    text: peripersonal space the per personal
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '3661.96'
    text: space is the area that I can touch with
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '3664.799'
    text: my hands um outside of that is a
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '3667.839'
    text: different part of the world that&amp;#39;s kind
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '3670.16'
    text: of happening in the parietal Lo one of
  - dur: '6.639'
    start: '3672.16'
    text: my favorite studies is this
  - dur: '9.519'
    start: '3674.28'
    text: like they got a monkey Myck monkey and
  - dur: '8.641'
    start: '3678.799'
    text: they trained it to grab things on a desk
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '3683.799'
    text: um and then they gave gave it a a
  - dur: '3'
    start: '3687.44'
    text: temporary lesion so they just like
  - dur: '2.84'
    start: '3688.92'
    text: squirt something into the part of the
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '3690.44'
    text: brain that handles that peripersonal
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '3691.76'
    text: perception so that that part of the
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '3693.599'
    text: brain kind of goes offline um and you
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3696.28'
    text: get what&amp;#39;s called cortical blindness so
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '3698.039'
    text: the monkey sort of loses its ability to
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '3700.28'
    text: to see things cartoon cartoon um in that
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '3703.839'
    text: per personal Zone then they took the
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '3706.079'
    text: monkeys and they train it to use a
  - dur: '6.041'
    start: '3707.599'
    text: grabber arm like a little like like claw
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '3711.039'
    text: arm so it now its reach is now farther
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '3713.64'
    text: because it can use this arm and when
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '3715.48'
    text: they ask after they teach it how to use
  - dur: '6.361'
    start: '3716.799'
    text: it and they sort of leion that per
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '3719.599'
    text: personal Zone the blind spot increases
  - dur: '3.879'
    start: '3723.16'
    text: to include the region that could be
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '3724.68'
    text: reached with the Grabber in addition to
  - dur: '6.441'
    start: '3727.039'
    text: the hand um
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '3730.559'
    text: so put that into your worldview and see
  - dur: '6.68'
    start: '3733.48'
    text: how it fits
  - dur: '7.96'
    start: '3735.359'
    text: um so anyways um here I am I see this
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '3740.16'
    text: cat and I have this awareness of my body
  - dur: '7.601'
    start: '3743.319'
    text: a lot of this is sort of call kind of
  - dur: '8.32'
    start: '3746.44'
    text: associate that with um proprioception um
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '3750.92'
    text: so like as my arm is out here it is uh
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '3754.76'
    text: putting force on my joints because of
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '3757.44'
    text: the weight of the arm and my body can
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '3759.72'
    text: encode and is aware of those forces and
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '3761.68'
    text: I can use that to kind of be aware of
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '3763.16'
    text: where my arm is I can also see my arm I
  - dur: '2.92'
    start: '3765.72'
    text: also have a memory of lifting it up
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '3767.24'
    text: there&amp;#39;s a lot of ways that we know where
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '3768.64'
    text: our bodies are um but I know that it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '3772'
    text: here and that if I can make this part
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '3774.44'
    text: move that way um then I&amp;#39;ll have I will
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '3777.96'
    text: have achieved

  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '3849.48'
    text: that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the loop so that&amp;#39;s one

    text: path through that perception action Loop
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '3854.64'
    text: because now that the information has
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '3856.599'
    text: gone in been processed been sort of
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '3859.279'
    text: whatever and now that I have moved my
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '3861.319'
    text: body I have now changed the state of the
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '3863.24'
    text: world like my body is in the world so
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '3865.279'
    text: now as I&amp;#39;m perceiving the situation as
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '3867.64'
    text: it stands I&amp;#39;m perceiving something
  - dur: '3.399'
    start: '3869.44'
    text: different and now I&amp;#39;m going to go back
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '3870.88'
    text: through that Loop and so of you know you
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '3872.839'
    text: perceive you act and then you take in
  - dur: '3.319'
    start: '3875.96'
    text: the information and you kind of like
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '3877.4'
    text: that Loop is tends to be where you live
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '3879.279'
    text: your whole life
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '3882.16'
    text: um and
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '3883.96'
    text: so yeah and so this is kind of the

    start: '3886.24'
    text: cartoon overview of of the story as it
  - dur: '6.119'
    start: '3889.72'
    text: as it holds um I will name some of the
  - dur: '6.241'
    start: '3893.279'
    text: uh the fields associated with the things
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '3895.839'
    text: that we talked about
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '3900.24'
    text: um yeah uh generally speaking when we
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '3904.079'
    text: talk
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '3905.16'
    text: about well talking about like the
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '3907.039'
    text: physiology of the eyeball tends to be
  - dur: '6.441'
    start: '3909.079'
    text: kind of like optology I guess um uh but
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '3913.2'
    text: that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s more like lens and pupil
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '3915.52'
    text: and like the the goopy Parts um once
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '3918.72'
    text: you&amp;#39;re talking about like the the neural
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '3921.48'
    text: the neural activity aspect of it we tend
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '3923.599'
    text: to call that like visual like visual
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '3926.839'
    text: Neuroscience perceptual
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '3928.52'
    text: Neuroscience because we are such Vision
  - dur: '6.159'
    start: '3930.88'
    text: heavy animals as humans often when you
  - dur: '7.159'
    start: '3933.44'
    text: hear perceptual we tend to mean visual
  - dur: '6.481'
    start: '3937.039'
    text: um but strictly speaking it&amp;#39;s all like
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '3940.599'
    text: anything sensory is perceptual um when
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '3943.52'
    text: we start talking about the parts of the
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '3945.279'
    text: Neuroscience that are moving your body
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '3947.44'
    text: we tend to call that motor Neuroscience
  - dur: '3.559'
    start: '3950'
    text: you will often hear people talk about
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '3951.559'
    text: perceptual motor Neuroscience which
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '3953.559'
    text: again perceptual motor is the same
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '3955.88'
    text: perceptual SL motor and it&amp;#39;s kind of
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '3958.2'
    text: like it&amp;#39;s this connection and this kind
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '3959.559'
    text: of like this reality that the two parts
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '3962.319'
    text: are um perception in action and
  - dur: '3.439'
    start: '3964.64'
    text: perception in motor control they&amp;#39;re sort
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '3966.119'
    text: of intimately
  - dur: '8.161'
    start: '3968.079'
    text: linked um oh I should mention this too
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '3971.76'
    text: um in your peripheral nervous system you
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '3976.359'
    text: have peripheral
  - dur: '5.439'
    start: '3978.4'
    text: neurons and your peripheral neurons come
  - dur: '6.599'
    start: '3980.76'
    text: in two types there is perceptual and
  - dur: '6.841'
    start: '3983.839'
    text: there&amp;#39;s motor shockingly
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '3987.359'
    text: and that distinction is is defined by
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '3990.68'
    text: basically which direction the
  - dur: '6.601'
    start: '3992.039'
    text: information is Flowing so a motor
  - dur: '6.121'
    start: '3994.839'
    text: command goes out from your central
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '3998.64'
    text: nervous system towards your periphery
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '4000.96'
    text: carrying a motor command so this this is
  - dur: '6.521'
    start: '4003.359'
    text: a a neuron that&amp;#39;s connected to a you
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '4006.2'
    text: know motor unit in my muscle and if it
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '4009.88'
    text: gets sort of tapped by one of these
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '4011.799'
    text: higher level structures it&amp;#39;s going to
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '4014.16'
    text: get spikes
  - dur: '7.28'
    start: '4016.559'
    text: that are telling it to Fire and that
  - dur: '10.121'
    start: '4018.839'
    text: will contract the muscle um once I touch
  - dur: '8.161'
    start: '4023.839'
    text: the cat what was the object of my plans
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '4028.96'
    text: um there are the the
  - dur: '7.88'
    start: '4032'
    text: the the the the neurons connected to
  - dur: '6.8'
    start: '4034.799'
    text: like the sensory um organs in my hand
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '4039.88'
    text: start firing differently and they send
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '4041.599'
    text: information back down your sensory
  - dur: '3.559'
    start: '4044.72'
    text: peripheral nerves peripheral sensory
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '4046.559'
    text: nerves yeah
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '4048.279'
    text: so in your periphery it is just it&amp;#39;s out
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '4051.68'
    text: outward stuff is your motor neurons um
  - dur: '3.481'
    start: '4055.039'
    text: inward stuff is your Sensory neurons and
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '4056.64'
    text: that&amp;#39;s kind of the main distinction
  - dur: '8.079'
    start: '4058.52'
    text: there um again uh just the word cartoons
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '4062.279'
    text: going on there yeah why are you
  - dur: '6.719'
    start: '4066.88'
    text: aware what&amp;#39;s that why you not like
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '4071.079'
    text: aware why are you not
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '4073.599'
    text: aware yeah
  - dur: '7.919'
    start: '4076.64'
    text: this is one of I think the
  - dur: '8.2'
    start: '4078.96'
    text: most troubling realities of being alive
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '4084.559'
    text: is that and this is also part of the the
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '4087.16'
    text: standard um existential crisis that
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '4090.039'
    text: classes like this tends to give to
  - dur: '9.399'
    start: '4091.76'
    text: people so have fun with that um we have
  - dur: '8.12'
    start: '4096.239'
    text: a very very thin awareness of what is
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '4101.159'
    text: going on under the hood in our bodies
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '4104.359'
    text: and we have
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4106.4'
    text: we have some awareness we have some
  - dur: '2.679'
    start: '4108'
    text: conscious experience of like I&amp;#39;m going
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '4109.4'
    text: to reach out and grab this thing I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '4110.679'
    text: going to oh yeah this feels cool in my
  - dur: '6.719'
    start: '4113.12'
    text: hand this feels hard in my hand um
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '4117.719'
    text: but the more you learn about
  - dur: '2.52'
    start: '4119.839'
    text: neuroscience and the more you learn
  - dur: '3.281'
    start: '4121.199'
    text: about what&amp;#39;s going on in the Hood the
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '4122.359'
    text: more you realize that those sensory that
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '4124.48'
    text: like the cognitive like the the
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '4126.679'
    text: conscious personal experience of having
  - dur: '6.801'
    start: '4129.159'
    text: a motor experience um is a really really
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4133.159'
    text: thin layer on top of a lot of complexity
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '4135.96'
    text: that&amp;#39;s going on and that is
  - dur: '5.441'
    start: '4138.679'
    text: unfortunately just like the situation
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '4141.04'
    text: that we are in um remember one time I
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '4144.12'
    text: was in grad
  - dur: '5.761'
    start: '4145.199'
    text: school and we were in like a a parking
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '4148.759'
    text: lot my friends and winter waiting to go
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4150.96'
    text: on a hike or something like that and for
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '4153.719'
    text: some reason this really stuck with me
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '4154.96'
    text: but there was just like a puddle of like
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '4157.799'
    text: dirty water in the middle of the parking
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '4160.92'
    text: lot that had this like really beautiful
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '4163.719'
    text: like oil sheen on top of it and it was
  - dur: '7.241'
    start: '4166.239'
    text: just like the sort of fractal iridescent
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '4169.799'
    text: colors just and by the nature of oil
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '4173.48'
    text: it&amp;#39;s just like one molecule thick that
  - dur: '7.801'
    start: '4175.759'
    text: is giving this really beautiful like
  - dur: '7.36'
    start: '4178.839'
    text: vibrant colorful shape on top of just
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '4183.56'
    text: cold dark murky water and I think about
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '4186.199'
    text: that a lot when I think about the
  - dur: '4.481'
    start: '4188.159'
    text: nervous system because it just feels
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '4190.279'
    text: like that is kind of our experience of
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '4192.64'
    text: living in a body is we have this
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '4195.88'
    text: experience that is sort of riding on top
  - dur: '8.08'
    start: '4198.8'
    text: of this really deep and
  - dur: '10.84'
    start: '4200.96'
    text: complex biological neural complex system
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '4206.88'
    text: and the that conscious Sheen is related
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '4211.8'
    text: to the depths of what&amp;#39;s going on there
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '4213.64'
    text: but we don&amp;#39;t really tend to have access
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '4215.6'
    text: to it like I can&amp;#39;t feel my stomach
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '4218.239'
    text: deciding when it wants to squirt out
  - dur: '5.919'
    start: '4220.32'
    text: more enzymes to digest my food and I
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '4223'
    text: can&amp;#39;t tell the difference between
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '4226.239'
    text: you know parts of this thing happening
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '4229.36'
    text: and you know like it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s not
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '4231.64'
    text: really available to me there are once
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '4234.48'
    text: you start learning about the about the
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '4236.44'
    text: bits and pieces you can start kind of
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '4239.159'
    text: mapping on your your conscious
  - dur: '3.2'
    start: '4241.56'
    text: experiences to the things that I&amp;#39;m going
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '4243.239'
    text: to be telling you is maybe happening
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '4244.76'
    text: under the hood um one of the ones that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '4247.88'
    text: coming to me right now for whatever
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4249.04'
    text: reason is like it&amp;#39;s kind of a thing that
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '4251.44'
    text: is known where when when when a person
  - dur: '2.56'
    start: '4253.56'
    text: starts lifting weights for the first
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '4254.92'
    text: time if you&amp;#39;ve never been a
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '4256.12'
    text: weightlifting person there&amp;#39;s a a thing
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4258.48'
    text: that happens where you very quickly like
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '4261.48'
    text: you&amp;#39;ll shoot up the amount of weight
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '4263.4'
    text: that you can lift in a very short amount
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '4264.96'
    text: of time because your body is learning
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '4268.199'
    text: how to fire all of your motor units at
  - dur: '3.08'
    start: '4270.84'
    text: once and that&amp;#39;s just the thing that in
  - dur: '3.399'
    start: '4272.32'
    text: your general life you just tend not to
  - dur: '3.84'

    text: do and you kind of have to learn how to
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '4275.719'
    text: do that like how to extend like maximal
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '4277.76'
    text: effort
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '4279.4'
    text: and that is something that&amp;#39;s happening
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '4281.52'
    text: at the level of like recruitment of
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4283.28'
    text: motor units and so if you then if you
  - dur: '3.119'
    start: '4286.12'
    text: now go to the gym and you start having
  - dur: '2.68'
    start: '4287.8'
    text: that experience you sort of feel oh yeah
  - dur: '3.561'
    start: '4289.239'
    text: I&amp;#39;m getting super strong and it&amp;#39;s just
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '4290.48'
    text: kind of like you can map that experience
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '4292.8'
    text: onto this thing I just said about how
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '4294.36'
    text: your motor units work but it&amp;#39;s in but
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '4296.76'
    text: that mapping is in the this like weird
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '4298.679'
    text: cognitive space like it&amp;#39;s not at that
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '4300.88'
    text: level of like deep awareness but then
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '4303.8'
    text: you have to ask like what what would
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '4305.6'
    text: that even look like if it was yeah so
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '4307.84'
    text: over time when you&amp;#39;re like lifting
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '4309.36'
    text: weight why do you hit
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '4311.52'
    text: a because eventually you you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '4313.679'
    text: recruiting all of your motor units and
  - dur: '3.759'
    start: '4315.92'
    text: then you just don&amp;#39;t have enough muscle
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '4317.239'
    text: to produce the force so that&amp;#39;s the that
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '4319.679'
    text: beginner spike in performance is you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '4322.6'
    text: not actually growing muscle mass in that
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '4324.52'
    text: period of time you&amp;#39;re just learning how
  - dur: '3.561'
    start: '4326.239'
    text: to actually like use all the muscles
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '4328.08'
    text: that you have and then you hit that
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4329.8'
    text: plateau and it&amp;#39;s like okay well now I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '4331.96'
    text: using I&amp;#39;m firing 100% of my muscle
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '4334.84'
    text: abilities just my muscles aren&amp;#39;t strong
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '4336.4'
    text: enough to actually move my body so and a
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4338.44'
    text: lot of those sort of plateaus in
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '4340.96'
    text: performance can be sort of tied back to
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '4343.44'
    text: sort of physiological structures that
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '4344.88'
    text: change and like the time courses of of
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '4347.32'
    text: improvement happen that you know like
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '4349.199'
    text: growing more muscle takes time whereas
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '4351.48'
    text: learning how to fire motor units also
  - dur: '7.56'
    start: '4354.52'
    text: takes time but not in the same way
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '4357.88'
    text: so a lot of dep there
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '4362.08'
    text: um that area that I was just so speaking
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '4364.6'
    text: of
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '4365.88'
    text: naming I never I&amp;#39;ve never been able to
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '4368.679'
    text: finish a leure before the end of class
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '4373.88'
    text: um that thing were just that little area
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '4376.76'
    text: is kind of often in the area we would
  - dur: '7.92'
    start: '4378.48'
    text: call neuromechanics neuromechanics is a
  - dur: '6.199'
    start: '4382.44'
    text: relatively new newly named field I would
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4386.4'
    text: be curious to see if it&amp;#39;s in that
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '4388.639'
    text: mesh uh terminology thing we learned
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '4390.92'
    text: about last time um but neuromechanics
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '4394.56'
    text: neural mechanics um is kind of like at
  - dur: '8.08'
    start: '4397.76'
    text: that boundary of neural activity and
  - dur: '7.24'
    start: '4401.08'
    text: like and like physics like mechanics um
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4405.84'
    text: stuff uh so that thing of like firing a
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '4408.32'
    text: motor unit to create a spring force that
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '4410.76'
    text: moves the limb that&amp;#39;s a neuromechanical
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '4413'
    text: question um and then like how that
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '4414.88'
    text: connects to like the spinal Central
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '4416.6'
    text: pattern generators you know that&amp;#39;s where
  - dur: '3.281'
    start: '4418.679'
    text: it starts to get like is that still
  - dur: '5.801'
    start: '4420.239'
    text: neuromechanics is that you know these
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '4421.96'
    text: are murky areas um on the other side of
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '4426.04'
    text: neuromechanics you have biomechanics
  - dur: '6.239'
    start: '4428.44'
    text: biomechanics is
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '4429.88'
    text: literally Newton&amp;#39;s Laws as it applies to
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '4434.679'
    text: meat
  - dur: '8.319'
    start: '4435.84'
    text: um and we will be talking about that
  - dur: '7.16'
    start: '4439.76'
    text: uh to some level of specificity um the
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '4444.159'
    text: not too distant future
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '4446.92'
    text: um let&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4451.84'
    text: see yeah let me let me finish this up
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '4454.12'
    text: and we&amp;#39;ll talk about
  - dur: '4.479'
    start: '4456.76'
    text: that um yeah so biome mechanics is
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '4459.76'
    text: related to like just the physics of
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '4461.239'
    text: moving your body um we&amp;#39;re particularly
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4463.679'
    text: going to talk about
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '4465.639'
    text: descriptions of the body that are that
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '4467.679'
    text: basically remove any conception of
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '4471'
    text: biology from them and just thinking
  - dur: '8.4'
    start: '4472.56'
    text: about the human as an object that weighs
  - dur: '7.96'
    start: '4476.4'
    text: a lot and is balanced on a pretty narrow
  - dur: '6.239'
    start: '4480.96'
    text: uh platform and that&amp;#39;s sort of center of
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '4484.36'
    text: mass base of support level of uh
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4487.199'
    text: description of the human body which we
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '4488.719'
    text: will talk about in some detail pretty
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '4491.719'
    text: soon um another thing I haven&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '4494'
    text: mentioned but we will talk about to is
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '4495.92'
    text: evolution because all of these systems
  - dur: '8.04'
    start: '4498.04'
    text: are evolved systems they all they
  - dur: '7.959'
    start: '4500.28'
    text: developed over billions of years um to
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '4506.08'
    text: the form that they currently are and in
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '4508.239'
    text: the same sense of things you can
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '4510.56'
    text: describe the system as it stands right
  - dur: '2.84'
    start: '4512.92'
    text: now but you&amp;#39;re always going to be
  - dur: '3.279'
    start: '4514.36'
    text: missing some of the story if you don&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '4515.76'
    text: think about it in the context of how it
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '4517.639'
    text: emerged um and so I haven&amp;#39;t quite
  - dur: '3.881'
    start: '4520.639'
    text: figured
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '4522.4'
    text: out a lot of the things I&amp;#39;m talking
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '4524.52'
    text: about are the things that are going to
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4525.88'
    text: go into these sort of numbered lectures
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4528.84'
    text: once I sort of figure out how I want to
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '4530.92'
    text: chop things up um there&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m going to
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '4533.88'
    text: be extracting a lot of things from what
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '4535.6'
    text: your conversations are to figure out how
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4537.04'
    text: to steer that those lectures um there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '4540.56'
    text: some hit points that I&amp;#39;m going to hit no
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '4542.04'
    text: matter what you guys want to do um and
  - dur: '2.2'
    start: '4544.8'
    text: evolution is going to be one of those
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '4546'
    text: things and
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '4547'
    text: specifically for us
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4549.8'
    text: um it&amp;#39;s going to I&amp;#39;m going to be well I
  - dur: '3.761'
    start: '4552.639'
    text: guess talk a little about the evolution
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '4553.8'
    text: of your eye but um I think a lot of my
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '4556.4'
    text: particular interest is in the thing that
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '4559.76'
    text: is often yeah evolution of your your
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '4562.56'
    text: skeleton um like why our skeletons are
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4565.44'
    text: the particular weird shape that they are
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '4567.76'
    text: how we sort of developed from our
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '4570.96'
    text: Origins as fish that turn into lizards
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '4573.88'
    text: that turn
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '4575'
    text: into squirrels that turn into monkeys
  - dur: '8.679'
    start: '4577.96'
    text: that turn into Apes that turn into us um
  - dur: '8.44'
    start: '4581.04'
    text: because it matters a lot um
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '4586.639'
    text: evolution of our eye is another odd
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '4589.48'
    text: story
  - dur: '5.801'
    start: '4591.239'
    text: uh the our retina is backwards in some
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4594.6'
    text: pretty interesting ways like it&amp;#39;s not
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '4597.04'
    text: it&amp;#39;s like flipped in the direction that
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '4599.12'
    text: you would expect it to be like you would
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '4601.32'
    text: expect that the light sensing aspects of
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '4603.44'
    text: it will be facing towards the light but
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '4606.159'
    text: they&amp;#39;re actually backwards they face
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '4608.56'
    text: back and they kind of have to bounce
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '4610.12'
    text: through and this is thought to be
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '4611.719'
    text: related to like when we crawled out of
  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '4613.76'
    text: the ocean and our eyes kind of inverted
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '4616'
    text: to
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4616.88'
    text: allow the same kind of refraction to
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4619.4'
    text: happen
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '4623.08'
    text: um yeah so uh we didn&amp;#39;t talk in this
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '4626.36'
    text: particular story about eye movements eye
  - dur: '6'
    start: '4628.52'
    text: movements we will talk about also in
  - dur: '6.201'
    start: '4630.159'
    text: some detail um I we have we humans have
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '4634.52'
    text: very mobile eyes that&amp;#39;s a very
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '4636.36'
    text: Cornerstone aspect of our visual system
  - dur: '6.801'
    start: '4638.199'
    text: is that our eyes move a lot um it is
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '4642.719'
    text: part of the motor system to be able to
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '4645'
    text: move any part of your body including the
  - dur: '6.68'
    start: '4646.36'
    text: eyes and that specific area is called
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '4649.44'
    text: ocul motor control oculo eye motor
  - dur: '7.159'
    start: '4653.04'
    text: movement oculo motor is sort of stuff
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '4656.4'
    text: related to eye movements um and so
  - dur: '3.361'
    start: '4660.199'
    text: things like ocul motor control is
  - dur: '3.239'
    start: '4662'
    text: obviously very overlapping with things
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4663.56'
    text: like visual perception and perceptual
  - dur: '6.281'
    start: '4665.239'
    text: Neuroscience because as we move our eyes
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '4668.48'
    text: the information on the retina changes
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '4671.52'
    text: and we have to make and we make
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '4672.96'
    text: decisions about where to move our eyes
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '4675.48'
    text: in the same way we make decisions about
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '4676.88'
    text: where to move our our arms but this is
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '4679.28'
    text: also a place that
  - dur: '6'
    start: '4681.04'
    text: like as like we you can live a whole
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '4684.88'
    text: happy life and like never really think
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '4687.04'
    text: about your eye movements but once you
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '4689.199'
    text: start thinking about your eye movements
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '4690.639'
    text: you&amp;#39;ll realize that it&amp;#39;s I think about
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '4693.28'
    text: it a lot like it&amp;#39;s it feels a lot like
  - dur: '6'
    start: '4695.44'
    text: breathing to me where usually your
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '4699.8'
    text: breathing is something that just happens
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '4701.44'
    text: on its own but you can control it to
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '4704.4'
    text: some EXT like I can hold my breath I can
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '4706.92'
    text: take a breath I can do that I have
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '4708.96'
    text: volitional control over my breathing in
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '4711.6'
    text: a way that I don&amp;#39;t over my heart um and
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '4715'
    text: our eye movements are kind of like that
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '4716.48'
    text: as well like I can choose to look one
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '4718.44'
    text: place or another um I can choose not to
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '4720.92'
    text: look at something um but for the most
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '4724.08'
    text: part for
  - dur: '6.8'
    start: '4725.08'
    text: 99.9% of my Waking Life my eyes are just
  - dur: '6.881'
    start: '4728.239'
    text: kind of doing what they do um and being
  - dur: '7.319'
    start: '4731.88'
    text: driven by a combination of a ailable
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '4735.12'

    start: '4741.44'
    text: something in the air I will look at it
  - dur: '6'
    start: '4743.28'
    text: and then catch it and there&amp;#39;s a lot of
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '4746.8'
    text: that process that is happening just

    start: '4749.28'
    text: below that level of conscious awareness
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '4752'
    text: um and that I think is a nice enough
  - dur: '7.279'
    start: '4754.44'
    text: segue into we&amp;#39;re going to talk about for

    text: the last 10 minutes which is methods
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '4761.719'
    text: methodologies um methods is kind of a
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '4764.44'
    text: it&amp;#39;s just just the term that we use
  - dur: '4.52'

    text: for like how in God&amp;#39;s name are you going
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '4769.159'
    text: to study any of this that&amp;#39;s kind of what
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '4770.92'
    text: methods means
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '4773.199'
    text: and generally speaking when we talk
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '4775.32'
    text: about methods we&amp;#39;re talking about
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '4778.36'
    text: um equipment and and ways that we can do
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '4781.679'
    text: empirical measurements of the world that
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '4783.56'
    text: will give us information about parts of
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '4787.159'
    text: the world that we think might we might
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '4788.88'
    text: be able to glean some insight into these
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '4791.88'
    text: deeper weirder aspects of the this is

  - dur: '5.761'
    start: '4801.199'
    text: which is desired um and it is a sort of

    start: '4804.239'
    text: philosophy of science term
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4806.96'
    text: about what are you trying to figure out
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '4809.52'
    text: you came into this room as a scientist
  - dur: '2.92'
    start: '4811.96'
    text: because you have a certain there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.321'
    start: '4813.639'
    text: something you want to know more about
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '4814.88'
    text: there&amp;#39;s some part of the world that you
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '4816.96'
    text: want to gain insight into what is that
  - dur: '4.759'
    start: '4820.44'
    text: thing and how how can you do it given
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '4823.56'
    text: all the limitations and straints and
  - dur: '7.561'
    start: '4825.199'
    text: sort of difficulties of like how the
  - dur: '8.72'
    start: '4828.28'
    text: world is um for me in for me in my sort
  - dur: '8.12'
    start: '4832.76'
    text: of domain of inquiry um I I use two
  - dur: '6.92'
    start: '4837'
    text: primary uh research tools map which is
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '4840.88'
    text: sort for motion capture um which is the
  - dur: '3.719'
    start: '4843.92'
    text: thing if you see like behind the scenes
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '4846'
    text: stuff in movies and video games like the
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '4847.639'
    text: suit with the dots and stuff like that
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '4850.28'
    text: that&amp;#39;s motion capture and that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '4851.719'
    text: basically related to um moving the body
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '4855.4'
    text: like sort of recording the movement of
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '4857.32'
    text: the body um in space and I will
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '4860.48'
    text: be at one of the lab sections I will be
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '4863.199'
    text: showing um I&amp;#39;ll be bringing in some
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4865.8'
    text: cameras and doing a freeo cap recording
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '4868.52'
    text: which is the open source software that
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '4869.8'
    text: I&amp;#39;ve been building um which is designed
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '4871.679'
    text: to like help um record the body with a
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '4874.92'
    text: high degree of fidelity um like this
  - dur: '3.879'
    start: '4877.36'
    text: specific three-dimensional configuration
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '4879.04'
    text: of the body at any given moment in time
  - dur: '4.241'
    start: '4881.239'
    text: because you know I would love to be able
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '4883.199'
    text: to study all the Bing activity of the
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '4885.48'
    text: pingi cells and the cerebellum but
  - dur: '2.879'
    start: '4887.76'
    text: that&amp;#39;s not available to me in this year
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '4889.44'
    text: of Our Lord
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4890.639'
    text: 2025 um I can&amp;#39;t actually get that
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '4893.04'
    text: measurement and the methods that I could
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '4894.639'
    text: use even if we if we if we could get
  - dur: '3.759'
    start: '4896.4'
    text: that from something like fmri which is
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4898.6'
    text: like the tube that you get the sort of
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '4900.159'
    text: colorful pictures of the brain um in
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4903.6'
    text: this current moment in technology I
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '4906.719'
    text: can&amp;#39;t use that type of a tool and also
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '4909.12'
    text: have a person out in the world throwing
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '4911.48'
    text: and catching and doing stuff like that
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '4914.159'
    text: um
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '4915.6'
    text: and so we use motion capture as a
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '4918.6'
    text: methodology to record the 3D
  - dur: '6.599'
    start: '4921.04'
    text: configuration of the body over time then
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4924.679'
    text: we use those movements to try to infer
  - dur: '5.801'
    start: '4927.639'
    text: while if the if the arm did this and
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '4930.199'
    text: gravity is like that then the muscles
  - dur: '4.239'
    start: '4933.44'
    text: must have done this or that in order to
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '4936.04'
    text: produce the forces that generated that
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '4937.679'
    text: movement and then you kind of backtrack
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '4939.76'
    text: from well if the mo if the muscles did
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '4941.6'
    text: this then the spine must have done that
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '4943.6'
    text: and sort of you can use this kind of
  - dur: '6.201'
    start: '4945.239'
    text: like this observable aspect of reality
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '4948.159'
    text: which is like the location of the arm
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '4951.44'
    text: measure it to the level of fidelity that
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '4953'
    text: you can with the available technology
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '4954.6'
    text: that you have and then use those
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '4957.08'
    text: empirical measurements to try to infer
  - dur: '3.239'
    start: '4959.96'
    text: all this weird goopy nonsense of what
  - dur: '2.601'
    start: '4961.719'
    text: I&amp;#39;ve been talking about about this part
  - dur: '3.761'
    start: '4963.199'
    text: of the brain that part of the brain that
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '4964.32'
    text: part of the brain um the other
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '4966.96'
    text: technology that I tend to use a lot is I
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '4969.52'
    text: can draw on this board ey tracking which
  - dur: '6.8'
    start: '4972.56'
    text: everybody loves eye tracking um it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '4974.84'
    text: always a crowd favorite um but that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '4979.36'
    text: another sort of
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '4980.88'
    text: like there&amp;#39;s different tools to use it
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '4983.08'
    text: but mostly these days we use video-
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4985.32'
    text: based eye trackers which is literally
  - dur: '7.4'
    start: '4986.96'
    text: just little cameras pointed at the eye
  - dur: '7.6'
    start: '4990.36'
    text: and it&amp;#39;s kind of a a convenient thing
  - dur: '7.4'
    start: '4994.36'
    text: that we are as humans um have these
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '4997.96'
    text: highly mobile eyes um that sort of wind
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '5001.76'
    text: up giving this really interesting
  - dur: '6.159'
    start: '5003.52'
    text: readout of what my brain wanted to get
  - dur: '5'
    start: '5007.48'
    text: more information about at each moment in
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '5009.679'
    text: time so if you give me a task like
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '5012.48'
    text: walking over rough terrain or sort of
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '5014.4'
    text: juggling or throwing and catching or
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '5016.28'
    text: something like that um you can look at
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '5019.08'
    text: the movement of my eye and at the very
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '5022.84'
    text: least know the visual information that
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '5025.12'
    text: was available to me in that moment by
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '5027.159'
    text: doing sort of 3D modeling and sort of
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '5029.679'
    text: saying okay the eye moved this way and
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '5031.44'
    text: then this the object was over here and
  - dur: '2.88'
    start: '5033.48'
    text: so you know
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '5034.96'
    text: you know based on what I know about the
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '5036.36'
    text: eye I couldn&amp;#39;t see it then or I could
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '5038.44'
    text: see it in my
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '5040'
    text: periphery um and then I chose to make a
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '5042.4'
    text: movement that would align my eye so now
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '5044.96'
    text: it&amp;#39;s in my phobia and so you can use
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '5048.32'
    text: just like a camera pointed at the eye to
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '5050.76'
    text: tell the information that was being
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '5053.159'
    text: transmitted into my visual cortex and
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '5055.32'
    text: sort of going down that way which both
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '5057.8'
    text: gives you the information that I had
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '5060.12'
    text: available and more importantly arguably
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '5063.199'
    text: the place that my eyes move to tells me
  - dur: '4.239'
    start: '5066.44'
    text: the place that my central nervous system
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '5068.52'
    text: decided I want more information from
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '5070.679'
    text: this part of the world and because those
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '5073.159'
    text: eye movements tend to happen really
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '5075.12'
    text: really fast like you know 150
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '5076.96'
    text: milliseconds per eye movement if you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '5078.28'
    text: doing a difficult task um like well
  - dur: '3.081'
    start: '5082.239'
    text: below the level of conscious awareness
  - dur: '4'
    start: '5083.84'
    text: we can tell stories about what we were
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '5085.32'
    text: doing after the fact but in the moment
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '5087.84'
    text: the eyes just kind of go where they need
  - dur: '6.041'
    start: '5089.239'
    text: to go um and so I can tell both what
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '5093.4'
    text: information was available to this weird
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '5095.28'
    text: magical meat robot at any moment in time
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '5097.96'
    text: and I can also look at the decisions
  - dur: '5.721'
    start: '5100.159'
    text: that were made of oh I&amp;#39;m going to move
  - dur: '6.799'
    start: '5101.84'
    text: my eyes this way and not that way until
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '5105.88'
    text: where my central nervous system desired
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '5108.639'
    text: more information from in the world at
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '5111.159'
    text: any moment in time and so in the by the
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '5113.4'
    text: combination of these things of being
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '5115.119'
    text: able to measure the sort of the
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '5117.44'
    text: perceptual input in the form of eye
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '5119.08'
    text: tracking and the motor output in the
  - dur: '9.2'
    start: '5121.4'
    text: form of motion capture um
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '5126.04'
    text: Wei this is my general attempt is to my
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '5130.6'
    text: my general approach to scientific
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '5132.32'
    text: research is to try to combine these two
  - dur: '4'
    start: '5134.44'
    text: methodologies to give a sense of like
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '5136.88'
    text: get a picture of what&amp;#39;s h of what a
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '5138.44'
    text: given of a what a human is doing in the
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '5140.719'
    text: world as they sort of perform complex
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '5142.56'
    text: actions and then use that weird pile of
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '5146.119'
    text: data that pours out of those machines to
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '5148.6'
    text: give some insight into this stuff often
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '5151.8'
    text: in my particular case
  - dur: '6.319'
    start: '5154.4'
    text: in the sort of conversation of science
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '5157.08'
    text: um I I this domain this typ type of
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '5160.719'
    text: research tends to give ecologically
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '5163.52'
    text: valid like like realist like it&amp;#39;s real
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '5165.8'
    text: data of real people doing real stuff but
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '5167.92'
    text: the Fidelity is just limited like
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '5169.4'
    text: there&amp;#39;s only the the accuracy and
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '5171.56'
    text: precision of information that I can
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '5173.04'
    text: provide with these methods is just very
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '5174.84'
    text: very limited relative to someone who&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.239'
    start: '5176.96'
    text: in a lab pulling out individual neurons
  - dur: '2.959'
    start: '5179.76'
    text: and sort of doing all the reductionist
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '5181.199'
    text: work that they can do to get really
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '5182.719'
    text: precise numbers so the so the the
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '5185.84'
    text: sociology of Sciences people like me
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '5188.239'
    text: doing the broad scoke type of research
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '5191.56'
    text: work with people who to the more careful
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '5193.92'
    text: reduction of stuff and ideally we kind
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '5196.08'
    text: of we both work together so that we can
  - dur: '4.52'

    text: okay so uh catching up we are here in
  - dur: '11.001'
    start: '7.799'
    text: week five and slowly catching up to
  - dur: '9.28'
    start: '13.36'
    text: reality I suppose um so last week we
  - dur: '6.719'
    start: '18.8'
    text: recorded some motion capture data
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '22.64'
    text: involving standing posture and jumps and
  - dur: '5'
    start: '25.519'
    text: repeated jumps and that whole good stuff
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '28.279'
    text: and then um
  - dur: '8.161'
    start: '30.519'
    text: last time on Monday we looked pretty
  - dur: '7.399'
    start: '33.68'
    text: closely into that data um focusing on
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '38.68'
    text: the sort of like the
  - dur: '6.601'
    start: '41.079'
    text: epistemological chain like the from like
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '45.16'
    text: the the pipeline from the empirical
  - dur: '3.519'
    start: '47.68'
    text: measurement represented by the video
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '49.12'
    text: recordings into the sort of like
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '51.199'
    text: increasingly more complex analyses and
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '53.64'
    text: sort of you know processes that that
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '56.76'
    text: produce the data into a format that we
  - dur: '3.041'
    start: '58.559'
    text: could actually start to analyze
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '60.359'
    text: understand and sort of make some
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '61.6'
    text: insights about the thing that we care
  - dur: '2.961'
    start: '64.119'
    text: about which in that case was standing
  - dur: '2.881'
    start: '65.519'
    text: posture and looking at the differences
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '67.08'
    text: between the supported versus the
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '68.4'
    text: unsupported thing and sort of trying to
  - dur: '5.439'
    start: '70.68'
    text: wrap our head around that way of looking
  - dur: '6.601'
    start: '73.119'
    text: at data
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '76.119'
    text: um and I hope that was kind of like
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '79.72'
    text: generally helpful both for like you know
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '82.479'
    text: this specific type of data but also like
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '84.92'
    text: that same kind of thought process will
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '87.36'
    text: be true for any kind of scientific
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '89.96'
    text: investigation you want to do like at any
  - dur: '4'
    start: '91.72'
    text: at some level if you&amp;#39;re looking if
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '93.32'
    text: you&amp;#39;re trying to derive knowledge about
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '95.72'
    text: the world on the basis of some kind of
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '97.36'
    text: empirical measurement it&amp;#39;s going to have
  - dur: '2.72'
    start: '100'
    text: some kind of a process that&amp;#39;s similar to
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '101.6'
    text: what we went through last time where
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '102.72'
    text: there&amp;#39;s going to be some tool that is
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '105.439'
    text: taking some kind of a measurement from
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '107.32'
    text: the world that measurement will be some
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '109.56'
    text: super basic sort of like some energy in
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '112.64'
    text: the world that gets transformed into
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '114.32'
    text: some quantity that is easy for us to
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '116.84'
    text: sort of record and take a record of and
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '119.439'
    text: then
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '120.88'
    text: generally speaking that data will not be
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '123.159'
    text: something that you can just look at and
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '124.92'
    text: then sort of derive anything interesting
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '127.24'
    text: about the world there&amp;#39;s going to have to
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '128.52'
    text: be some kind of a process of calibration
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '131.12'
    text: and computation and Analysis and da da
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '133.12'
    text: da da da and at the end of that sort of
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '135.72'
    text: sometimes very long computational
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '137.519'
    text: pipeline you&amp;#39;ll be looking at data that
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '139.84'
    text: will be represented in some way and
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '141.48'
    text: you&amp;#39;ll be trying to generate something
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '144.28'
    text: resembling knowledge about the world
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '146.319'
    text: from looking at that so I think the main
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '148.959'
    text: point I wanted to make last time is just
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '150.44'
    text: to think about each stage of that
  - dur: '8.441'
    start: '152.239'
    text: process as a sort of a a chain of
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '156.68'
    text: epistemological grounding um where your
  - dur: '5.559'
    start: '160.68'
    text: ability to trust the outcome of that
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '163.2'
    text: long pipeline is only as strong as the
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '166.239'
    text: weakest link in that analysis so if
  - dur: '5.481'
    start: '168.159'
    text: there&amp;#39;s some like weird magic step in
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '171.12'
    text: Step 12 of
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '173.64'
    text: 255 even if every other step in that
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '176.48'
    text: process is super grounded truth
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '178.239'
    text: preserving like old school reliable
  - dur: '4.479'
    start: '180.68'
    text: computation if there&amp;#39;s some weird step
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '182.92'
    text: in the middle there everything after
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '185.159'
    text: that is no
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '187.08'
    text: longer reliable in terms of like its
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '189.44'
    text: ability to track reality in the way that
  - dur: '4.241'
    start: '191.239'
    text: we want it
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '193.28'
    text: to
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '195.48'
    text: um so today uh I&amp;#39;m going to do sort of
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '199.84'
    text: two things which is historically a
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '201.64'
    text: mistake but I think we can do it um I I
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '206'
    text: want
  - dur: '5.959'
    start: '206.92'
    text: to sort of look at just go back into the
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '210.599'
    text: data and look at the some of the the
  - dur: '3.521'
    start: '212.879'
    text: data that we didn&amp;#39;t look at which is the
  - dur: '7.679'
    start: '214.56'
    text: the last condition of the repeated
  - dur: '7.919'
    start: '216.4'
    text: jumping um and show uh a an analysis of
  - dur: '5.801'
    start: '222.239'
    text: that data that have generated in
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '224.319'
    text: previous years and can look at here um
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '228.04'
    text: to make a couple of different points
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '229.439'
    text: both just sort of like that U the
  - dur: '4.481'
    start: '232.239'
    text: different structure of a movement that
  - dur: '4.479'
    start: '234.68'
    text: has that kind of like repetitive phasic
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '236.72'
    text: kind of aspect to it so as opposed to
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '239.159'
    text: being standing posture which is a
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '241.439'
    text: continuous control problem or like a big
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '244.4'
    text: singular jump which is like a discreet
  - dur: '6'
    start: '246.599'
    text: sort of behavior um the repeated jumping
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '251'
    text: has this kind of phasic thing where sort
  - dur: '8.76'
    start: '252.599'
    text: of each stage I see you uh uh each stage
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '257.56'
    text: sort of sets each step in the phasic
  - dur: '5.801'
    start: '261.359'
    text: process sets you up for the
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '264.04'
    text: next iteration um and so there&amp;#39;s just
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '267.16'
    text: some different ways of analyzing data
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '269.16'
    text: like that and there&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;s many many many
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '270.84'
    text: aspects of the natural world that has
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '272.68'
    text: that sort of property Locomotion running
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '275.12'
    text: is one of them also like your circadian
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '276.88'
    text: rhythms and you know like the seasons uh
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '279.919'
    text: a lot of things have this structure of
  - dur: '6.401'
    start: '281.919'
    text: kind of like a pattern that repeats
  - dur: '7'
    start: '284.32'
    text: itself um in a way that&amp;#39;s sort of like
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '288.32'
    text: related to linear time but not directly
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '291.32'
    text: related so like the seasons is a good
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '293.24'
    text: example of that actually like the the
  - dur: '8.56'
    start: '294.8'
    text: the year counts up so 24 25 26 um but
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '299.32'
    text: when comes at its own sort of rate and
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '303.36'
    text: we&amp;#39;ll just look a little bit about that
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '305.52'
    text: um hopefully that won&amp;#39;t take us all that
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '308.08'
    text: long um and I want to leave the last
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '311.4'
    text: sort of optimistically hour but possibly
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '314.32'
    text: less uh to do a little bit of small
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '316.84'
    text: group work um which I will sort of try
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '320.08'
    text: to relate to the initial part um where
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '323.6'
    text: it that will be forming into small
  - dur: '4.481'
    start: '325.759'
    text: groups of roughly uh three three
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '328.72'
    text: three-ish folks
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '330.24'
    text: um with the intention of sort of doing
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '332.52'
    text: some work with the bot to find a a paper
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '336.44'
    text: which can complement the paper that
  - dur: '3.879'
    start: '337.88'
    text: you&amp;#39;ve already chosen for your chosen
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '339.4'
    text: topic and specifically trying to find
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '341.759'
    text: papers on a similar topic but are that
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '344.16'
    text: are sort of distinct in some interesting
  - dur: '6.361'
    start: '347.479'
    text: way so you can start looking at sort of
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '350'
    text: different perspectives on your chosen
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '353.84'
    text: topic
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '356.24'
    text: um yeah and then I think that will sort
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '358.36'
    text: of lead us nicely into kind of like the
  - dur: '5.719'
    start: '360.6'
    text: second half of the semester and by the
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '363.88'
    text: end of next week I want to kind of be
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '366.319'
    text: getting into the space where you have
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '367.72'
    text: like a more grounded sense of what the
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '370.12'
    text: the final poster project is really going
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '371.68'
    text: to look like and sort of you know have
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '373.68'
    text: the ability to start hypothetically
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '376.28'
    text: making movements in that direction
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '378.52'
    text: realize that there&amp;#39;s kind of some weird
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '380.16'
    text: timing here but don&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t stress too
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '382.319'
    text: much about those things we&amp;#39;ll make it
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '383.84'
    text: we&amp;#39;ll make it
  - dur: '4'
    start: '385.479'
    text: work um
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '391.319'
    text: right yeah anyways just realized that
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '394.759'
    text: yeah poster do is less of it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s less
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '397.599'
    text: of an exclamation point than it appears
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '399.08'
    text: on the page um this upload poster this
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '401.72'
    text: is really the hard deadline like you
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '403.72'
    text: have to upload your poster so they can
  - dur: '3.239'
    start: '405.24'
    text: get printed in time for whatever um
  - dur: '3.201'
    start: '407.319'
    text: everything before that is a little more
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '408.479'
    text: squishy I try to make this do before
  - dur: '4.239'
    start: '410.52'
    text: spring bake so that you&amp;#39;re kind of like
  - dur: '3'
    start: '412.639'
    text: free from that responsibility but
  - dur: '2.481'
    start: '414.759'
    text: there&amp;#39;s a little bit of like weird
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '415.639'
    text: squishiness
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '417.24'
    text: there um
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '420.96'
    text: okay cool everyone cool with that so far
  - dur: '7.28'
    start: '423.72'
    text: any assignment anxiety yeah good um all
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '427.8'
    text: right and there will be a sort of we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '431'
    text: going to call it an exam for
  - dur: '2.481'
    start: '432.919'
    text: bureaucratic reasons but it&amp;#39;s really
  - dur: '2.6'
    start: '434.4'
    text: just going to be another one of these
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '435.4'
    text: like directed bot-based
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '437'
    text: conversations where specifically I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '438.96'
    text: going to be extracting all the like the
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '441.84'
    text: the sort of philosophy of science kinds
  - dur: '3.519'
    start: '444.08'
    text: of aspects of the past several lectures
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '445.96'
    text: in terms of like units and recordings
  - dur: '6.88'
    start: '447.599'
    text: and empirical this and that and you will
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '451.12'
    text: have a directed conversation with the AI
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '454.479'
    text: about connecting those types of thoughts
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '456.759'
    text: to the particular domain that you&amp;#39;ve
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '458.68'
    text: chosen to study um I can&amp;#39;t imagine any
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '462.08'
    text: of you have chosen a topic that won&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '463.56'
    text: have some relationship with units and
  - dur: '5.761'
    start: '466.479'
    text: measurement and methodology and stuff
  - dur: '6.88'
    start: '468.36'
    text: like that so um you know it&amp;#39;s not going
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '472.24'
    text: to be something that you can it we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '475.24'
    text: going to call it an exam but you can&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '477.36'
    text: really get a grade on it because I think
  - dur: '7.079'
    start: '478.8'
    text: it&amp;#39;s unethical to use AI to grade things
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '482.319'
    text: um for a lot of reasons but we will yeah
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '485.879'
    text: we&amp;#39;ll be fine
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '488.479'
    text: okay
  - dur: '7.679'
    start: '490.08'
    text: so um I have to start up Discord which
  - dur: '9.08'
    start: '493.44'
    text: could take a second um I did move the
  - dur: '6.801'
    start: '497.759'
    text: recordings from the other week into a
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '502.52'
    text: Google drive folder so you can download
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '504.56'
    text: them if you so
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '506.199'
    text: choose uh I&amp;#39;m not going to really going
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '508.4'
    text: too deep into that aspect of it um but
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '512.159'
    text: in the server in the links and resources
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '514.12'
    text: there&amp;#39;s a Google Drive link that will
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '516.08'
    text: take you to a page which
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '519.56'
    text: should show something if this loads am I
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '522.68'
    text: on the
  - dur: '7.16'
    start: '523.64'
    text: internet yeah so these are all the
  - dur: '8.84'
    start: '526.2'
    text: recordings in some strange order
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '530.8'
    text: uh yeah maybe a different maybe later in
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '535.04'
    text: the semester I&amp;#39;ll talk a little more
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '536.44'
    text: about how to get it and run it but um
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '538.8'
    text: for now you can kind of my the the only
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '541.72'
    text: recommendation I&amp;#39;ll make is if you want
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '543.079'
    text: to look at any of these on your computer
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '545.44'
    text: your best bet is to download the entire
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '548.36'
    text: folder so don&amp;#39;t download bits and pieces
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '550.6'
    text: download the the entire folder of a
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '552.88'
    text: given recording and then open up the
  - dur: '5.439'
    start: '555.64'
    text: blend file with blender
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '558.8'
    text: and poke around and if you don&amp;#39;t know
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '561.079'
    text: how to use blender there are many many
  - dur: '5.801'
    start: '563.079'
    text: many many many tutorials online on how
  - dur: '5.961'
    start: '565.399'
    text: to do that so you can figure that out on
  - dur: '2.48'
    start: '568.88'
    text: your own
  - dur: '3'
    start: '573.519'
    text: okay
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '578.92'
    text: so with that
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '584.079'
    text: said you thinking so hard
  - dur: '7.76'
    start: '589.88'
    text: buddy let&amp;#39;s take a look at this repeated
  - dur: '4'
    start: '593.64'
    text: jumps recording
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '603.8'
    text: so if you
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '605.88'
    text: recall let see
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '612.519'
    text: here so again this is going to come up
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '615.079'
    text: later but again noticing that the the
  - dur: '5.959'
    start: '617.12'
    text: initial data here is broken garbage
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '620.48'
    text: because I am not in the scene everything
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '623.079'
    text: gets this is a very common way that data
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '625.76'
    text: breaks when you&amp;#39;re trying to do 3D stuff
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '627.64'
    text: with bad input it just all gets squished
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '629.839'
    text: into a singular line um so this will
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '632.6'
    text: come up later just notice that the data
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '634.519'
    text: starts out as garbage and then it sort
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '636.24'
    text: of snaps into place whenever I walk into
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '638.079'
    text: the scene and I stand here in that sort
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '640.8'
    text: of calibration sort of
  - dur: '8.68'
    start: '643.44'
    text: pose and
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '646.88'
    text: I then start bouncing up and
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '654.72'
    text: down
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '657.32'
    text: hide and if we hide this
  - dur: '5.881'
    start: '660.519'
    text: we can look at that and we can
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '664.36'
    text: grab I think we can
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '666.4'
    text: '[Music]'
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '668.76'
    text: do that
  - dur: '3.59'
    start: '679.11'
    text: '[Music]'
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '683.839'
    text: work I never know how to make that work
  - dur: '7.119'
    start: '686.16'
    text: it&amp;#39;s fine okay so we gra you we&amp;#39;re going
  - dur: '6.281'
    start: '688.959'
    text: to say round frame we&amp;#39;re going to do two
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '693.279'
    text: seconds before and not
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '695.24'
    text: after and then we going to calculate
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '698.04'
    text: whole
  - dur: '7.76'
    start: '700.12'
    text: recording then we&amp;#39;re going to hide the
  - dur: '7.28'
    start: '703.44'
    text: key frames show custom color make
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '707.88'
    text: it make it
  - dur: '8.84'
    start: '710.72'
    text: Pink
  - dur: '7.08'
    start: '712.48'
    text: and yeah and so there we go so
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '720.2'
    text: here I am jumping for some amount of
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '722.32'
    text: time
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '723.8'
    text: and I guess
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '730.68'
    text: let&amp;#39;s we&amp;#39;ll get to that when we get to
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '732.92'
    text: that and let&amp;#39;s look at the graph editor
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '736'
    text: let&amp;#39;s turn so with the standing posture
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '739.36'
    text: stuff
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '741.6'
    text: uh I was look we were looking at like
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '744.48'
    text: the projection of the center of mass
  - dur: '5.959'
    start: '746'
    text: onto the floor relative to the base of
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '748.24'
    text: support and so in that for that task the
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '751.959'
    text: height of the center of mass is not
  - dur: '7.24'
    start: '753.76'
    text: relevant to that analysis we only really
  - dur: '5.481'
    start: '757.199'
    text: care about where I am where that where
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '761'
    text: that Center of mass position is on the
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '762.68'
    text: ground plane which we&amp;#39;re going to Define
  - dur: '6.159'
    start: '764.68'
    text: as XY and then Z is going to be up in
  - dur: '6.239'
    start: '767.04'
    text: this world um so that balance task X and
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '770.839'
    text: Y are relevant Dimensions Z is not a
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '773.279'
    text: relevant dimension for the model of of
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '776.04'
    text: standing that we&amp;#39;re looking at there if
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '778.16'
    text: we were looking at a more comp complex
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '780.32'
    text: model of standing that had things like
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '782.519'
    text: joint angles and stuff like that we
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '784.12'
    text: might care about the Z axis but because
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '786.8'
    text: we&amp;#39;re living in this sort of hypers
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '787.88'
    text: simplified world we basically get to
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '790.399'
    text: throw away the height of the center mass
  - dur: '6.279'
    start: '792.36'
    text: and now we&amp;#39;ve boiled down this entire
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '794.56'
    text: complex being data object into two
  - dur: '4.521'
    start: '798.639'
    text: singular
  - dur: '3'
    start: '800.16'
    text: points
  - dur: '6.519'
    start: '804'
    text: um with something like jumping it&amp;#39;s the
  - dur: '4.479'
    start: '807.48'
    text: opposite uh when I&amp;#39;m jumping around
  - dur: '4'
    start: '810.519'
    text: we&amp;#39;re thinking about that as something
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '811.959'
    text: like I&amp;#39;m putting Force into the ground
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '814.519'
    text: that is fighting against gravity and if
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '816.8'
    text: I put more Force into the ground than I
  - dur: '5'
    start: '819.079'
    text: weigh uh where weight is measured in
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '821.68'
    text: Newton so it&amp;#39;s Mass my body mass times
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '824.079'
    text: gravity gives you my Newton Force if I
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '827.32'
    text: put more than that Force into the ground
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '829.32'
    text: I will temporarily leave the ground as
  - dur: '3.161'
    start: '831.959'
    text: gravity sucks that energy away from me I
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '833.759'
    text: will reach a certain height and then
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '835.12'
    text: come back to the ground so that behavior
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '837.44'
    text: is defined relative to this inertial
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '839.92'
    text: reference plane and specifically
  - dur: '4.521'
    start: '842.839'
    text: inertial reference frame is like
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '844.839'
    text: basically like code work for the ground
  - dur: '5.919'
    start: '847.36'
    text: is at zero and you know some direction
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '849.759'
    text: points up and so that jumping Behavior
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '853.279'
    text: it if I&amp;#39;m jumping here or jumping there
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '855.519'
    text: or jumping there or jumping there it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.721'
    start: '857.399'
    text: the same process either way so in this
  - dur: '5.041'
    start: '860.759'
    text: for this behavior for this task we
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '863.12'
    text: actually don&amp;#39;t care about the X and Y
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '865.8'
    text: AIS and we only care about the z-axis
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '868.32'
    text: the vertical axis
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '870.16'
    text: um if this was a different task I&amp;#39;m like
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '872.16'
    text: going from Stepping Stones if I&amp;#39;m

  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '880.959'
    text: just thinking about the base level
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '882.24'
    text: physics of it the physics are the same
  - dur: '3.401'
    start: '884.079'
    text: in one part of the room or the other all
  - dur: '3.2'
    start: '886.12'
    text: of which is basically a long-winded way
  - dur: '5'
    start: '887.48'
    text: of saying that I can turn off the X and
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '889.32'
    text: Y data from this viewer and normalize
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '892.48'
    text: that it&amp;#39;s not actually what I
  - dur: '4'
    start: '894.36'
    text: wanted and
  - dur: '2.919'
    start: '900.16'
    text: what is going on
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '908.32'
    text: there not sure why that looks like that
  - dur: '6.8'
    start: '911.839'
    text: but
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '913.279'
    text: okay and we get this nice so
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '922.8'
    text: this data here
  - dur: '6'
    start: '931.68'
    text: so this shows the sort of vertical
  - dur: '8.201'
    start: '934.519'
    text: motion of my center of mass so the x
  - dur: '8.8'
    start: '937.68'
    text: axis here hypothetically is meters um so
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '942.72'
    text: from except it&amp;#39;s upside down why is it
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '946.48'
    text: upside down I don&amp;#39;t know why it&amp;#39;s upside
  - dur: '4'
    start: '949.12'
    text: down um
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '960.519'
    text: these units are confusing me a little
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '962.079'
    text: bit I think it kind of loses track of
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '963.839'
    text: some of that because it&amp;#39;s this is
  - dur: '7.88'
    start: '965.519'
    text: negative .85 and this is negative point9
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '968.319'
    text: so that&amp;#39;s kind of down but this
  - dur: '8.8'
    start: '979.56'
    text: is yeah that that says this one says
  - dur: '7.281'
    start: '984.279'
    text: 1.43 M which is probably about this high
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '988.36'
    text: this is one 1.8 so let&amp;#39;s call this
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '991.56'
    text: '1.4'
  - dur: '6.679'
    start: '993.6'
    text: um I I could probably jump
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '996.48'
    text: that seems right um so I don&amp;#39;t know why
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '1000.279'
    text: these units are happening this is sort
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '1001.759'
    text: of a thing that I&amp;#39;ve noted like blender
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '1004.24'
    text: is not a scientific tool blender is an
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1006.04'
    text: animation artistic tool so sometimes
  - dur: '3.399'
    start: '1008.36'
    text: things like oh let&amp;#39;s make sure all the
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '1010.04'
    text: the units are correct they&amp;#39;re a little
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '1011.759'
    text: more fudgy on that than you would expect
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '1014.199'
    text: from a scientific tool but this is sort
  - dur: '3.719'
    start: '1015.68'
    text: of a it&amp;#39;s more of a cultural thing than
  - dur: '2.84'
    start: '1018.6'
    text: any
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '1019.399'
    text: real like in order to do this type of
  - dur: '2.92'
    start: '1021.44'
    text: stuff right they have to be doing the
  - dur: '2.68'
    start: '1023.04'
    text: math correctly and they have to be
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '1024.36'
    text: keeping track of units here and there or
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '1025.72'
    text: the other but the user base of this
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '1027.76'
    text: software are more concerned with just
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '1029.839'
    text: like the general shapes of the data and
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '1032.079'
    text: sort of and things were like oh these
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '1033.76'
    text: numbers don&amp;#39;t actually match those
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '1035.679'
    text: numbers is first of all almost certainly
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '1037.959'
    text: like a setting that I&amp;#39;m not doing
  - dur: '5.439'
    start: '1039.6'
    text: properly but you know a scientific tool
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '1042.919'
    text: wouldn&amp;#39;t do this an artistic tool would
  - dur: '3.441'
    start: '1045.039'
    text: luckily in this context I similarly
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '1047.12'
    text: don&amp;#39;t really care about the values I
  - dur: '7.52'
    start: '1048.48'
    text: only care about the shapes um but this
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '1052.16'
    text: is sort of a nice opportunity to look at
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1056'
    text: how this
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '1058.12'
    text: non-dimensionalization so so
  - dur: '6.8'
    start: '1060.4'
    text: dropping the X and Y
  - dur: '5.721'
    start: '1063.799'
    text: AIS the X and Y data from this plot
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '1067.2'
    text: makes it so that the data becomes this
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '1069.52'
    text: much simpler one-dimensional time series
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '1072.72'
    text: right because the x-axis represents time
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '1075.36'
    text: specifically it represents frame number
  - dur: '2.76'
    start: '1078.32'
    text: uh where
  - dur: '5.519'
    start: '1079.52'
    text: if you wanted to calculate like the
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '1081.08'
    text: clock time we could convert that using
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '1085.039'
    text: our knowledge of the frame rate and that
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '1087.4'
    text: stuff like that
  - dur: '7.68'
    start: '1089.6'
    text: um but if you&amp;#39;ll notice as I&amp;#39;m sort of
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1093.88'
    text: so down here at the bottom of the jump I
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '1097.28'
    text: jump
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '1099'
    text: up uh in the actual 3D data I&amp;#39;m kind of
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '1102.88'
    text: Shifting around in space like I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '1105.12'
    text: not bouncing on over the origin the
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '1107.039'
    text: whole time I&amp;#39;m shifting around my X and
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '1108.6'
    text: Y values are changing um but we don&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '3'
    start: '1111.6'
    text: have to care about that if we&amp;#39;re just
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1112.76'
    text: looking at the height so in terms of the
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1114.6'
    text: mechanics of the situation we could
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '1116.76'
    text: convert this into Newtons by just
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1119.6'
    text: multiplying by getting the potential
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1122.039'
    text: energy here and just saying okay the the
  - dur: '6.8'
    start: '1123.84'
    text: Z height is height and then Mass doesn&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '5.441'
    start: '1127.039'
    text: change gravity doesn&amp;#39;t change so this if
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '1130.64'
    text: we wanted to convert this plot into a
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1132.48'
    text: plot of the potential energy of the
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '1135.039'
    text: physical system we could do that by just
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '1137.6'
    text: basically scaling it by by my mass or
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '1140.64'
    text: and the gravity on Earth um at which
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '1144.72'
    text: point you know again and if we did that
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '1147.76'
    text: these numbers would change but the shape
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '1149.44'
    text: would not because there&amp;#39;s nothing
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1150.72'
    text: interesting happening
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '1153.52'
    text: there
  - dur: '6.319'
    start: '1155.84'
    text: so there&amp;#39;s a lot of things that we could
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1158.919'
    text: look at here if we had you know more
  - dur: '3.321'
    start: '1162.159'
    text: time in research funding and stuff like
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '1163.919'
    text: that
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1165.48'
    text: um one of which would be like let&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '1167.799'
    text: assume you know if we were like sports
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '1169.72'
    text: biomechanists and we wanted to know
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '1171.159'
    text: about the force production that leads
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '1173.36'
    text: into jumping you know we might want to
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '1175.88'
    text: look
  - dur: '7.4'
    start: '1177.24'
    text: at you know how this sort of phase on
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '1181.039'
    text: the ground can I zoom there
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1193.88'
    text: more oop
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '1202.08'
    text: so here I am up at the top of the
  - dur: '5.719'
    start: '1204.08'
    text: jump
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '1206'
    text: um and then as I come
  - dur: '3'
    start: '1211.799'
    text: down
  - dur: '4.481'
    start: '1215.799'
    text: like so looking at the video back there
  - dur: '7.281'
    start: '1218.679'
    text: you can
  - dur: '8.36'
    start: '1220.28'
    text: tell right around there so I&amp;#39;m off the
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1225.96'
    text: ground and then this is around this
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '1228.64'
    text: frame is where I hit the ground no wait
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '1230.84'
    text: no that&amp;#39;s not right that&amp;#39;s the
  - dur: '3'
    start: '1237.32'
    text: opposite
  - dur: '6.921'
    start: '1242.679'
    text: okay right around there
  - dur: '5.041'
    start: '1246.799'
    text: so this whole phase here where I&amp;#39;m on
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '1249.6'
    text: the ground this first part you can see
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1251.84'
    text: I&amp;#39;m kind of I&amp;#39;m compressing like I have
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1254.44'
    text: a lot of energy in like mechanical
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '1256.96'
    text: energy in the system that has to go
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '1259.08'
    text: somewhere um and so I I bend my legs I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1262.76'
    text: not I don&amp;#39;t have like EMG recording the
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '1264.84'
    text: muscles on my quadriceps and hamstrings
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1267'
    text: or whatever but they&amp;#39;re on I promise you
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '1269'
    text: that they&amp;#39;re on because I don&amp;#39;t collapse
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '1271.24'
    text: to the ground my legs just kind of
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '1273.159'
    text: deform a little bit and then I push off
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '1275.4'
    text: and I come back
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '1276.96'
    text: into I go back into the air
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '1281'
    text: so this is where I think we&amp;#39;ve come
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '1283.44'
    text: across the term like neuromechanics
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1285.279'
    text: before this is kind of at that level we
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1288.24'
    text: we could ask questions at that level
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '1290.039'
    text: here about like you know how efficient
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '1293.24'
    text: am I as an organism at taking advantage
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1296.799'
    text: of the fact that the force of gravity is
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1299.48'
    text: preloading my muscles with all this like
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '1301.559'
    text: nice spring Force then how how
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '1304.12'
    text: efficiently do I utilize that spring
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '1306.12'
    text: force in order to launch myself off the
  - dur: '4.919'
    start: '1308'
    text: ground for the next jump because clearly
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '1310.08'
    text: when I push off I am using um you know
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '1312.919'
    text: something from on high is sending the
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '1315.039'
    text: signal down to trigger a muscle firing
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '1319.279'
    text: that will allow me to bounce off the
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '1320.679'
    text: ground but unlike that standing high
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '1323.32'
    text: jump thing I don&amp;#39;t have to generate all
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '1325.919'
    text: that force on my own I have some of the
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '1328.24'
    text: force from the previous jump preloading
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '1331'
    text: my limbs so that when I actually you
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1334'
    text: know take off in the next jump I have
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '1336.44'
    text: the the force from my muscles is going
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '1338.4'
    text: to be presumably sort of like
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '1341.64'
    text: efficiently combined with the spring
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '1344.24'
    text: force from the previous jump which is
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '1346.84'
    text: also you know it gets very complicated
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '1349.96'
    text: very quickly
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '1352.039'
    text: um
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '1353.64'
    text: so yeah like so we could look at sort of
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '1357.36'
    text: you know how efficiently I&amp;#39;m doing that
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '1359.52'
    text: translation from from one jump to the
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '1361.72'
    text: other um we could also look at things
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '1364.76'
    text: like fatigue so if we were looking if we
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '1368'
    text: expected that over the course like these
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '1370.559'
    text: jumps look pretty similar but it might
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '1372.84'
    text: be the case that if you looked at the
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '1375.12'
    text: the time between the Peaks it might get
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '1377'
    text: longer as I get more tired the the peak
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '1379.72'
    text: height might get a little bit less as I
  - dur: '4.239'
    start: '1381.44'
    text: get tired I wasn&amp;#39;t really pushing myself
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '1383.919'
    text: all that hard so and it wasn&amp;#39;t a
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '1385.679'
    text: particularly long recording um so if
  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '1390.039'
    text: those numbers are there they might be
  - dur: '6.041'
    start: '1391.159'
    text: more subtle
  - dur: '6.921'
    start: '1393.159'
    text: um but there&amp;#39;s a lot of sort of
  - dur: '7.16'
    start: '1397.2'
    text: potential analyses and potential kind of
  - dur: '7.959'
    start: '1400.08'
    text: um just ways of considering this data uh
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '1404.36'
    text: that would not be sort of possible just

    text: it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s only possible because of the
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '1409.4'
    text: sort of repetitive aspect of it and
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1411.36'
    text: again like I&amp;#39;ve said before the stuff
  - dur: '3.719'
    start: '1413.84'
    text: for bouncing in place is kind of like a
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '1416.12'
    text: proxy for what it would look like if
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1417.559'
    text: this was like if I was running or or
  - dur: '5'
    start: '1419.799'
    text: jogging or walking or something one of
  - dur: '5.881'
    start: '1421.559'
    text: those kind of repeated sort of behaviors
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '1424.799'
    text: there
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '1427.44'
    text: um and again just kind of like
  - dur: '5.761'
    start: '1431.559'
    text: highlighting while this data in the
  - dur: '7.2'
    start: '1433.32'
    text: middle looks nice just looking at what
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '1437.32'
    text: bad data looks like sort of because one
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '1440.52'
    text: of the real advantages of this type of
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1442.279'
    text: data is it is directly coupled and tied
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1444.919'
    text: to like a thing that we have very very
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1446.919'
    text: strong intuitions about because it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '1449.159'
    text: it&amp;#39;s human movement it&amp;#39;s video like we
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '1451.559'
    text: kind of have some sense of what that
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '1452.919'
    text: data looks like if this was me a
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1455.2'
    text: measurement off of an accelerometer if
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '1457.36'
    text: it was a measurement off of an you know
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '1459.6'
    text: Mass spectrometer or something that is
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1461.32'
    text: less tied to our kind of like you know
  - dur: '3.119'
    start: '1464.44'
    text: the part of the world that we tend to
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '1465.72'
    text: operate and have a lot of intuitions
  - dur: '5.761'
    start: '1467.559'
    text: about might not be as obvious when the
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '1470.159'
    text: data is like good and viable versus when
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '1473.32'
    text: it&amp;#39;s being sort of busted out because
  - dur: '10.04'
    start: '1475.84'
    text: the because of some methodological thing
  - dur: '8.84'
    start: '1479.6'
    text: so uh so you know just this is just your
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '1485.88'
    text: reminder when you&amp;#39;re thinking about data
  - dur: '2.479'
    start: '1488.44'
    text: that you always have to be asking the
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '1489.799'
    text: question when you&amp;#39;re when you&amp;#39;re looking
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1490.919'
    text: at a data source from a from a piece of
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '1493.48'
    text: equipment or wherever you get it from
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '1495.679'
    text: you always kind of be have to be asking
  - dur: '4.479'
    start: '1497.08'
    text: the question am I looking at signal or
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '1499.48'
    text: am I looking at noise signal to noise
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '1501.559'
    text: ratio is kind of like a
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '1503.679'
    text: whole whole other
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '1505.64'
    text: conversation um but this is where kind
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '1508.36'
    text: of like building intuitions building
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '1510.44'
    text: understanding and just really like like
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '1512.12'
    text: having that kind of gut check of like am
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '1515.159'
    text: I looking at something that&amp;#39;s worth
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '1516.96'
    text: analysis or am I looking at some sort of
  - dur: '6.199'
    start: '1518.84'
    text: noise and bug in the system um and
  - dur: '6.88'
    start: '1522'
    text: that yeah that figuring that out can be
  - dur: '5.961'
    start: '1525.039'
    text: often the challenging part also noticing
  - dur: '5.919'
    start: '1528.88'
    text: because this will also come up later
  - dur: '7.96'
    start: '1531'
    text: this moment here where at some point on
  - dur: '7'
    start: '1534.799'
    text: my way out there&amp;#39;s like a a
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '1538.96'
    text: spike which can also happen where like
  - dur: '6.641'
    start: '1541.799'
    text: for one frame everything just jumped
  - dur: '7.519'
    start: '1544.64'
    text: over here so there is one data point
  - dur: '7.719'
    start: '1548.44'
    text: that is way outside the actual expected
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1552.159'
    text: range um
  - dur: '3.201'
    start: '1560.799'
    text: which will come up in a
  - dur: '7.521'
    start: '1564.919'
    text: bit okay that&amp;#39;ll make rough sense
  - dur: '8.561'
    start: '1568.559'
    text: following along jumping in space get
  - dur: '7.56'
    start: '1572.44'
    text: that no one&amp;#39;s mind is blown yet okay
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '1577.12'
    text: um okay so let&amp;#39;s now now let&amp;#39;s look at
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '1580'
    text: ways of representing this data that can
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '1581.72'
    text: sort of help us understand and sort of
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1584.84'
    text: starting to
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '1586.039'
    text: like torture the data into a shape
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '1588.84'
    text: that&amp;#39;s more amenable to that kind of
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '1590.399'
    text: like phase based um
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '1593.64'
    text: analysis and for that I&amp;#39;m also going to
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1596.679'
    text: show
  - dur: '8.44'
    start: '1597.52'
    text: you just a little bit of code um this
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '1601.799'
    text: code is on the the course repository now
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '1605.96'
    text: um if you&amp;#39;re familiar with python code
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1607.96'
    text: and particularly Jupiter notebooks it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '1609.559'
    text: in there um it&amp;#39;s not particularly like
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '1611.96'
    text: well set up
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '1613.6'
    text: for sort of student consumption but it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '1617.32'
    text: available it&amp;#39;s on there if you want to
  - dur: '6.159'
    start: '1618.76'
    text: find it it&amp;#39;s in the repo in the Cod fold
  - dur: '6.279'
    start: '1622'
    text: code folder in the python code folder
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '1624.919'
    text: we&amp;#39;re looking at jumping Center of
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '1628.279'
    text: mass
  - dur: '6.321'
    start: '1631.159'
    text: and this should
  - dur: '6.681'
    start: '1634.039'
    text: run um yeah so I&amp;#39;m not going to go too
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '1637.48'
    text: much into the the Cod code parts of it
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '1640.72'
    text: um I will
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '1642.679'
    text: just first of all will this
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '1645'
    text: run no thank you um
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '1648.919'
    text: just kind of just like doing a a quick
  - dur: '4.039'
    start: '1651.36'
    text: pass through just interested parties can
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '1653.88'
    text: pay attention uninterested parties can
  - dur: '3.721'
    start: '1655.399'
    text: just like wait for the Squigly line some
  - dur: '5.559'
    start: '1656.84'
    text: pretty pictures
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '1659.12'
    text: um but you&amp;#39;ll hear me talk a lot about
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '1662.399'
    text: just like writing code and doing
  - dur: '5.481'
    start: '1664.399'
    text: analysis and doing this and that and
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '1666.039'
    text: just FYI this is what that looks like um
  - dur: '3.519'
    start: '1669.88'
    text: so the first thing you do is you you in
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '1671.64'
    text: you install a bunch so this is python
  - dur: '3.481'
    start: '1673.399'
    text: code and so the first thing you do is
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '1674.88'
    text: you install a bunch of packages and
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '1676.88'
    text: packages like P are for numerical
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '1679.32'
    text: computations scipi for things like
  - dur: '4.521'
    start: '1681.559'
    text: scientific analysis of this that and the
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '1683.76'
    text: other and then plotly is for making the
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '1686.08'
    text: visual plots and squiggly lines and
  - dur: '5.439'
    start: '1688.08'
    text: stuff like that um these are all
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '1691.039'
    text: packages that were made by people many
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '1693.519'
    text: many people many of these packages numpy
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1696.279'
    text: and S cpai to some extent but numpy in
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '1698.72'
    text: particular has a lineage that goes all
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '1701.399'
    text: the way back to the sort of the first
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '1703.399'
    text: history of computing there is always at
  - dur: '3.079'
    start: '1705.72'
    text: every point in the history of our
  - dur: '3.401'
    start: '1707.559'
    text: actually
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '1708.799'
    text: the history of our sort of like you know
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '1710.96'
    text: long scale civilization but specifically
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '1713.6'
    text: in the computational world there has
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '1715.519'
    text: always been kind of like the de facto
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '1717.88'
    text: best like numerical computation package
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '1720.44'
    text: and I think these days numpy is probably
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '1723.24'
    text: the most widely used at least um in the
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1725.72'
    text: sort of data analysis World um but this
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1728.519'
    text: is the one that does like vector or sort
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '1730.6'
    text: of like Matrix computation does linear
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '1732.519'
    text: algebra a lot of like the big number
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '1734.72'
    text: crunching of the world is done sort of
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '1737.679'
    text: in numpy or related types of packages I
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '1741.48'
    text: just want to point these out because
  - dur: '5.919'
    start: '1742.64'
    text: this is very easy to skip over it&amp;#39;s not
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '1745'
    text: relevant particularly to this course but
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '1748.559'
    text: this is one of those places that if you
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '1750.08'
    text: really sit and think about just
  - dur: '6.041'
    start: '1752.799'
    text: the the volume of human effort and human
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '1755.84'
    text: labor that went into this import numpy
  - dur: '5.719'
    start: '1758.84'
    text: line of code is really staggering like
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '1762.36'
    text: like many thousands of people over
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '1764.559'
    text: decades working very very hard over a
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '1767.039'
    text: very long amount of time to make these
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '1769.2'
    text: things happen and invisibly and for free
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '1773.2'
    text: you can just import all of that labor
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1775.559'
    text: and now all the stuff that we get to do
  - dur: '5.759'
    start: '1777.76'
    text: is built off of that work that was done
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '1780.679'
    text: by these many folks over the history of
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '1783.519'
    text: their own time
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '1785.799'
    text: anyway
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '1787.84'
    text: um this is also a very important stage
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '1790.72'
    text: of every data analysis pipelines life
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '1793.88'
    text: this is loading the data in um and this
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '1796.6'
    text: is literally just the path to the folder
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '1799.72'
    text: on the computer and then specifically
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '1802.32'
    text: the path to the the body 3D data and
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '1805.799'
    text: then the center of mass XYZ data those
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '1809.36'
    text: these are not actually the center the
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '1811.2'
    text: csb uh sort of data uh files that I
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1815.6'
    text: showed last time but they are equivalent
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '1818.24'
    text: um so this is the part where that data
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '1820.24'
    text: gets
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '1821.2'
    text: into the program it&amp;#39;s then the RAM and
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '1824.08'
    text: the memory of the of the system and so
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '1825.919'
    text: when we when we want to look at it this
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '1828.039'
    text: is the part that where the computer has
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '1829.6'
    text: loaded that data in so that those those
  - dur: '4.521'
    start: '1831.559'
    text: like big infinite sort of piles of
  - dur: '4'
    start: '1834.24'
    text: numbers that I was showing last time
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '1836.08'
    text: this is the part where those numbers now
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '1838.24'
    text: enter into the system&amp;#39;s memory and now
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '1840.48'
    text: we can sort of look at
  - dur: '7.48'
    start: '1842.799'
    text: them uh load that
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '1846.44'
    text: up yeah you can load and look at its
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '1850.279'
    text: shape where this shape is we&amp;#39;re looking
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '1852.799'
    text: at the center of mass so it&amp;#39;s 1370 by3
  - dur: '8.6'
    start: '1855.559'
    text: so it&amp;#39;s 1,370 frames at 30 frames per
  - dur: '7.041'
    start: '1858.919'
    text: second three columns so X Y and Z that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.041'
    start: '1864.159'
    text: and we talk about the shape of the data
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '1865.96'
    text: that&amp;#39;s kind of what we&amp;#39;re talking about
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '1867.2'
    text: like how many frames how many dimensions
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '1869.639'
    text: if it had
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '1870.88'
    text: rotation so this would have to be six so
  - dur: '7'
    start: '1873.72'
    text: XYZ position XYZ rotation so this would
  - dur: '6.719'
    start: '1876.96'
    text: be 1370 by 6
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '1880.72'
    text: um
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '1883.679'
    text: and what everything is
  - dur: '7.079'
    start: '1885.96'
    text: here blah blah blah yeah get different
  - dur: '7.64'

    start: '1897.519'
    text: uh
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '1902.559'
    text: and now this is the part I think I I
  - dur: '3.199'
    start: '1904.84'
    text: think I&amp;#39;m have to restart it when I run
  - dur: '6.88'
    start: '1906.039'
    text: this I think it&amp;#39;s basic enough that it
  - dur: '7.52'
    start: '1908.039'
    text: happens um this is now the data has
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '1912.919'
    text: shown up into the
  - dur: '7.521'
    start: '1915.559'
    text: system and this is a very basic Bas plot
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '1918.84'
    text: of that um so this is the raw data in
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '1923.08'
    text: like I think it&amp;#39;s plotly or something
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '1924.72'
    text: like that um this is the very same data
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '1928.24'
    text: that you see in blender except in a much
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '1931.32'
    text: more impoverished form like one of the
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '1933.919'
    text: main kind of like you know labors and
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '1936.679'
    text: wins of the Primo cap software was
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '1939.279'
    text: figuring out how to adapt the sort of
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '1942.039'
    text: the lowlevel scientific code so it can
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '1944'
    text: be shoved into this animation software
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '1946.799'
    text: so that you can do all this nice things
  - dur: '3.559'
    start: '1948.48'
    text: and like have all this very easy way of
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '1950.48'
    text: clicking around and showing stuff
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '1952.039'
    text: without having to write the actual code
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '1953.96'
    text: but again because this is an artist tool
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '1956.24'
    text: it&amp;#39;s not really set up for doing kind of
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '1958'
    text: like deeper layers of
  - dur: '6'
    start: '1959.6'
    text: analysis
  - dur: '6.801'
    start: '1961.159'
    text: um so this is I think it just oh does it
  - dur: '2.36'
    start: '1965.6'
    text: just play
  - dur: '7.281'
    start: '1968.039'
    text: through yeah so this is sort
  - dur: '5.441'
    start: '1971.679'
    text: of this is what most this like for a lot
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '1975.32'
    text: of scientific analysis this would
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '1977.12'
    text: already be pretty good because it&amp;#39;s an
  - dur: '5.559'
    start: '1978.6'
    text: animation in 3D but you can very easily
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '1981.2'
    text: see how this is sort of not as useful of
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '1984.159'
    text: an interrogatory tool as something like
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '1986.44'
    text: a professional animation software
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '1988.72'
    text: designed for like 3D animations had a
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '1991.6'
    text: very interesting sort of layer of our
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '1994.039'
    text: society because they are artists and
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '1996.08'
    text: they think like artists but it&amp;#39;s also
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '1998.6'
    text: super heavy technical like computational
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '2000.96'
    text: 3D math um so that kind of like that
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '2004.12'
    text: boundary layer that is represented by
  - dur: '3'
    start: '2006.159'
    text: something like blender blender
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '2007.76'
    text: particular being like a free open source
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '2009.159'
    text: software as has that layer of it as well
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '2011.679'
    text: um it&amp;#39;s kind of like I think one of the
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '2014.279'
    text: interesting interfaces
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '2017'
    text: here um this is also a useful way to
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '2019.88'
    text: sort of confirm to yourself that you&amp;#39;ve
  - dur: '6.321'
    start: '2021.639'
    text: loaded the data correctly that up is in
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '2024.84'
    text: fact this direction very very very
  - dur: '4.959'
    start: '2027.96'
    text: common very very easy to load the data
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '2030.32'
    text: in a it&amp;#39;s just a snowstorm the dots are
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '2032.919'
    text: flying around all over the place or B
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '2035.2'
    text: this person&amp;#39;s jumping like this to the
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '2037.159'
    text: side because you haven&amp;#39;t rotated things
  - dur: '3.719'
    start: '2039.32'
    text: or you haven&amp;#39;t rotated them properly so
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '2040.96'
    text: that Z is up because remember a lot of
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2043.039'
    text: things we&amp;#39;re talking about here assumes
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '2045.159'
    text: that there is a that one of these X y&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '6.521'
    start: '2047.519'
    text: and Z&amp;#39;s is aligned with the gravity
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '2050.679'
    text: Vector but there&amp;#39;s nothing in the Raw
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '2054.04'
    text: geometry that has such a thing as
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2055.8'
    text: gravity cameras don&amp;#39;t know what gravity
  - dur: '5.919'
    start: '2057.96'
    text: is unless you have a secondary sensor in
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '2060.28'
    text: them which we don&amp;#39;t um so this type of
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '2063.879'
    text: thing sort of gets
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '2065.159'
    text: into uh overlap between like on the one
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '2068.679'
    text: hand this is not a like this kind of
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '2070.639'
    text: visualization is not a necessary step of
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '2072.96'
    text: the analysis pipeline but on a very
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '2075.04'
    text: practical level it absolutely is a
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '2077.32'
    text: necessary step to have what we would
  - dur: '4'
    start: '2079.679'
    text: call observability in your pipeline
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '2082.159'
    text: where the observability is the part
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '2083.679'
    text: where you can just you know you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '2085.76'
    text: you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re crunching big numbers with
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2087.76'
    text: with fancy code and the observability is
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '2090.359'
    text: a part where it produces something that
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '2092.24'
    text: you can use your your human eyeballs and
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '2094.52'
    text: big human brain to just look at it and
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '2096.8'
    text: say oh yeah that looks right that looks
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '2098.64'
    text: like a person jumping they look like
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '2100.599'
    text: they&amp;#39;re oriented with gravity and now
  - dur: '3.561'
    start: '2102.839'
    text: because of that I am now confident to
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '2104.64'
    text: move on to the next stages of the of the
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '2106.4'
    text: pipeline and start analyzing data
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '2109.839'
    text: whoever wrote this this is
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '2112.68'
    text: a can&amp;#39;t remember who wrote this
  - dur: '2.76'
    start: '2114.48'
    text: originally but I always get I always
  - dur: '4'
    start: '2115.839'
    text: like notice stuff like this like this is
  - dur: '6.359'
    start: '2117.24'
    text: the British spelling of analyzing with a
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '2119.839'
    text: s instead of a z so I don&amp;#39;t know could
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '2123.599'
    text: have been me could have been someone
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '2124.92'
    text: else hard to say
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '2128'
    text: okay so
  - dur: '5'
    start: '2131.64'
    text: um so we&amp;#39;ve talked about time
  - dur: '6.68'
    start: '2134.52'
    text: series uh
  - dur: '7.4'
    start: '2136.64'
    text: this this is not a Time series this is
  - dur: '6.399'
    start: '2141.2'
    text: a spatial representation of the data
  - dur: '6.039'
    start: '2144.04'
    text: there is actually nothing in this data
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '2147.599'
    text: that tells you what time is if you it
  - dur: '8.24'
    start: '2150.079'
    text: just happens to overtime plot the data
  - dur: '6.521'
    start: '2154.119'
    text: from the next frame at roughly 30 frames
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '2158.319'
    text: per second so it you can see time in the
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '2160.64'
    text: movement of in in the by looking at it
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '2163.68'
    text: for but there&amp;#39;s nothing in this repres
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '2166'
    text: this is a spatial representation there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '7.56'
    start: '2167.44'
    text: nothing in there sort none of these axes
  - dur: '8.04'
    start: '2170.319'
    text: are are T they are x y and z
  - dur: '7.079'
    start: '2175'
    text: um so we can also we can take that and
  - dur: '7.601'
    start: '2178.359'
    text: then we can also represent it in this
  - dur: '6.121'
    start: '2182.079'
    text: time series format right so this now we
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '2185.96'
    text: have to split it up so it can be flat we
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '2188.2'
    text: have X Y and Z and then this axis is
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '2192.16'
    text: time again specifically it&amp;#39;s frame
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '2193.839'
    text: number so we&amp;#39;re not in SI units here
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '2196.48'
    text: we&amp;#39;re in we don&amp;#39;t this for this to be SI
  - dur: '5.881'
    start: '2199.359'
    text: units this would have to be seconds but
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '2201.52'
    text: this is frames um so if you want to
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '2205.24'
    text: convert this to frames multiply this
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '2206.839'
    text: number by 0.033 or something which is
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '2209.92'
    text: the number of seconds per
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '2213.079'
    text: frame
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '2215.8'
    text: right frames per second and then you can
  - dur: '6.281'
    start: '2219.599'
    text: do some sort of nonsense and you get
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '2222.52'
    text: seconds per frame and this is one of the
  - dur: '5.959'
    start: '2225.88'
    text: weird things
  - dur: '8'
    start: '2227.119'
    text: about this part of calculus I don&amp;#39;t know
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '2231.839'
    text: um is realizing that you can do the same
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '2235.119'
    text: kind of like fraction math for units
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '2237.4'
    text: that you would for numbers and it&amp;#39;s like
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '2239.52'
    text: valid to do that so frames per second is
  - dur: '6.399'
    start: '2243.2'
    text: you can do that math and
  - dur: '6.839'
    start: '2245.76'
    text: get 33 Mill seconds per frame from 30
  - dur: '3'
    start: '2249.599'
    text: FPS
  - dur: '3'
    start: '2254.4'
    text: um
  - dur: '3'
    start: '2259.2'
    text: yeah
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '2268.16'
    text: right
  - dur: '5.079'
    start: '2269.76'
    text: yes so before when I was showing this I
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '2272.319'
    text: had already truncated the end frame to
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '2274.839'
    text: be before the actual end of the of the
  - dur: '3.081'
    start: '2277.119'
    text: recording
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '2278.48'
    text: remember when I said to notice this one
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '2280.2'
    text: weird spiky dot at the end of the
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '2283.56'
    text: recording if I don&amp;#39;t account for that
  - dur: '5.479'
    start: '2285.88'
    text: and I just plot all of the
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '2289.24'
    text: data at some point something on this
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '2291.359'
    text: computer is going to crash um this is
  - dur: '6.081'
    start: '2293.839'
    text: what it looks like because it&amp;#39;s I just
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '2296.56'
    text: said plot X plot y plot Z relative to
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '2299.92'
    text: the frame number um and it says sure no
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '2303.28'
    text: problem let I&amp;#39;ll do that for you and
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '2304.76'
    text: because I&amp;#39;m such a friendly computer
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '2306.52'
    text: I&amp;#39;ll be smart about how to do the axes
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '2309.64'
    text: specifically how to do this y AIS so
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '2312.16'
    text: that you can see all the data that you
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '2313.599'
    text: asked me to plot um but there&amp;#39;s this
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '2315.72'
    text: huge spiky outlier here that sort of
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '2318.04'
    text: ruins that so this spiky outlier so this
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2321.2'
    text: this plot goes from zero to
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '2323.839'
    text: 15,000 um which I don&amp;#39;t know if you
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '2325.72'
    text: remember from last time I did not
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '2327.44'
    text: actually fly 15,000 meters into the sky
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '2331.24'
    text: and then back that actually didn&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '2332.92'
    text: happen oh sorry millimeters so 15,000
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '2335.68'
    text: millimeters into the sky the this is a
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '2338.96'
    text: Blobby data Spike so I could fix this by
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '2342.44'
    text: sort of using my intuition and saying oh
  - dur: '6.199'
    start: '2344.92'
    text: let me let me tell the code to only have
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '2347.76'
    text: the Y limit show this range of numbers
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2351.119'
    text: but I don&amp;#39;t know what that range should
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '2353.28'
    text: be so the other thing I can do is I can
  - dur: '6.961'
    start: '2355.599'
    text: go up here and I can say okay the start
  - dur: '7.121'
    start: '2358.319'
    text: frame is zero the end frame negative one
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '2362.56'
    text: means just like the last frame um but I
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '2365.44'
    text: can also this is again where the
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '2366.64'
    text: observability comes super helpful uh I
  - dur: '6.281'
    start: '2369.119'
    text: can just go into this code and say okay
  - dur: '10.48'
    start: '2372.28'
    text: let&amp;#39;s see so this first chunk is sloppy
  - dur: '7.36'
    start: '2375.4'
    text: data of nothing until let&amp;#39;s say frame
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '2383.4'

    start: '2385.88'
    text: say yeah let&amp;#39;s say 150 is when the good
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2389.72'
    text: the good data starts and it stays pretty
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '2392.64'
    text: good
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '2394.2'
    text: until let&amp;#39;s say
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '2401.28'
    text: uh
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '2404.48'
    text: 12 let&amp;#39;s say
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '2406.52'
    text: 1213 so let&amp;#39;s say 150 to 1213 so start
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '2409.88'
    text: frame
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2411.8'
    text: 150 uh end frame
  - dur: '6.079'
    start: '2418'
    text: 123 and and then I appli it again
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '2421.48'
    text: instead of looking like that weird spike
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '2424.079'
    text: it looks like this so often times we
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '2427.119'
    text: need do data
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '2428.64'
    text: collection you&amp;#39;re you you&amp;#39;re trying to
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '2430.92'
    text: like if you&amp;#39;re doing data collection
  - dur: '3.199'
    start: '2432.88'
    text: you&amp;#39;re typically going be doing the same
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '2434.2'
    text: thing over and over again like multiple
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '2436.079'
    text: participants multiple you know
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '2438.119'
    text: conditions multiple days da da da so you
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '2440.119'
    text: really want your pipelines to have as
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '2442.24'
    text: little as possible of you the human have
  - dur: '3.441'
    start: '2445.599'
    text: to go in and look at something and sort
  - dur: '3.121'
    start: '2447.359'
    text: of figure out like what I just did of
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '2449.04'
    text: like oh let&amp;#39;s you frame blah blah blah
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '2450.48'
    text: to frame blah blah blah that&amp;#39;s a manual
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '2452.44'
    text: labor step that requires me to like do
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '2454.96'
    text: stuff with my human brain I can&amp;#39;t just
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '2457.64'
    text: load the data click go come back
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '2459.92'
    text: tomorrow record new data change the path
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '2462.44'
    text: and then click go I have to look at it
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '2464.28'
    text: and sort of pull out a number then write
  - dur: '5.041'
    start: '2466.599'
    text: that down somewhere so you want to
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '2469.119'
    text: minimize those steps but practically
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '2471.64'
    text: speaking there&amp;#39;s almost always going to
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '2472.76'
    text: be some amount of that kind of like data
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '2475.599'
    text: cleaning data preparation and so if this
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '2478.16'
    text: was going to be part of a longer study I
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '2480.52'
    text: would have some place to write down for
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '2484.28'
    text: data collection day whatever for
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '2486.24'
    text: participant whatever for condition
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '2488.16'
    text: whatever the start frame is 150 the end
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '2491'
    text: frame is 1213 and I would have some
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '2493.2'
    text: place to record those numbers so that as
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '2495.8'
    text: I keep collecting data I will keep I&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '2498.56'
    text: be able to keep track of this when I do
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '2500.04'
    text: the main analysis I can know that I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '2501.8'
    text: only getting the good good stuff
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '2512.76'
    text: yeah so it would be it would be really
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '2515.56'
    text: hard to pick a frame number
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '2518.24'
    text: um you could do something more kind of
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '2520.839'
    text: like what we did where like I picked
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '2522.2'
    text: kind of like a duration of time of like
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '2524.64'
    text: I want to do you know 30 seconds and
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '2526.88'
    text: then that would correspond to you know
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '2529.079'
    text: 30 seconds times 30 frames per second
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '2531.44'
    text: it&amp;#39;s like 900 frames or something like
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '2533.359'
    text: that but I wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '2534.96'
    text: necessarily say like oh on on frame 150
  - dur: '3.079'
    start: '2538.24'
    text: to frame
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '2539.28'
    text: 932 you know that&amp;#39;s something that you
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '2541.319'
    text: couldn&amp;#39;t really do you something that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.801'
    start: '2543.839'
    text: much more common to do is first of all
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '2546.28'
    text: picking durations and secondly deciding
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '2549.64'
    text: a behavior that will make the data easy
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '2552.04'
    text: to chop out often times in an analytical
  - dur: '6.879'
    start: '2555.48'
    text: way so with this if I said okay stand
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '2559.16'
    text: here don&amp;#39;t move for five seconds jump
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '2562.359'
    text: jump jump jump jump and at the end stand
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '2564.8'
    text: here don&amp;#39;t move for five seconds then in
  - dur: '7.52'
    start: '2567.52'
    text: the data when we look back at it there
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '2570.76'
    text: would be these flat spots right here
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '2575.04'
    text: to right here I like didn&amp;#39;t wait too
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '2577.72'
    text: long at the end um but this is the kind
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '2580.76'
    text: of thing that would be pretty easy to
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '2582.8'
    text: write some bit of code where you looking
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '2585.319'
    text: at the velocity of the blah blah blah
  - dur: '3'
    start: '2587.88'
    text: and then just find something that sort
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '2589.079'
    text: of automatically goes through and chunks
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '2590.88'
    text: out the first step from the last step
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '2593.319'
    text: and I would you know at this point in my
  - dur: '5'
    start: '2596'
    text: life I could write that code pretty
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '2597.64'
    text: easily and trust it pretty easily
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '2601'
    text: um but that was kind for like a
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '2603.28'
    text: hard-earned ability to do that and also
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '2606.319'
    text: anytime you&amp;#39;re doing that like you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '2608.76'
    text: always if you record enough data then
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '2611.64'
    text: that automated pipeline is going to work
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '2613.4'
    text: like 90% of the time and then that 10th
  - dur: '3.361'
    start: '2615.839'
    text: time it&amp;#39;s going to find something weird
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '2617.52'
    text: in the middle and then chop one of your
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '2619.2'
    text: participants data in half and then
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '2621.599'
    text: you&amp;#39;re not going to notice that until
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '2623'
    text: way too late blah blah blah blah blah so
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '2625.24'
    text: there always there&amp;#39;s always a very
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '2627.64'
    text: complex dance between I&amp;#39;m trying to
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '2630.28'
    text: automate every part of this pipeline so
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '2632.079'
    text: I can operate really efficiently
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '2635.4'
    text: versus the most efficient thing I can do
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '2637.599'
    text: is just manually Define these data
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '2639.68'
    text: points for each for each participant and
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '2642.2'
    text: then write it down somewhere and then
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '2644.48'
    text: like have just like another like CSV
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '2646.64'
    text: that just says for a participant one you
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '2650.28'
    text: know condition block two whatever start
  - dur: '4'
    start: '2653.28'
    text: frame this and frame that and then at
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '2654.92'
    text: the end of each recording session I just
  - dur: '2.48'
    start: '2657.28'
    text: write down those numbers and I never
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '2658.559'
    text: have to think about it again I don&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '6.88'
    start: '2659.76'
    text: have to write any fancy code to do it
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '2664.2'
    text: um sort of there&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s one of those
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '2666.64'
    text: like no answers thing and then if you go
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '2669.16'
    text: to grad school you
  - dur: '5'
    start: '2670.68'
    text: will
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '2672.8'
    text: uh you will lose significant hours of
  - dur: '6.919'
    start: '2675.68'
    text: your life on that sort of like should I
  - dur: '7.36'
    start: '2679.04'
    text: automate this or do it manually stage um
  - dur: '7.321'
    start: '2682.599'
    text: it&amp;#39;s a very classic brain trap that it
  - dur: '8.439'
    start: '2686.4'
    text: has no true escape
  - dur: '9.88'
    start: '2689.92'
    text: um yeah yeah that&amp;#39;s a yeah good
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '2694.839'
    text: question as there are they all okay okay
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '2700.2'
    text: so okay yeah so this part is
  - dur: '7.24'
    start: '2708.359'
    text: now so again looking at this as a
  - dur: '6.439'
    start: '2712.68'
    text: behavior looking at the X the Y and the
  - dur: '7.24'
    start: '2715.599'
    text: Z we can see again that like you know
  - dur: '6.121'
    start: '2719.119'
    text: the task is is very well defined in that
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '2722.839'
    text: z-axis um and you can see this nice sort
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '2725.24'
    text: of regularity of the data there and of
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '2727.28'
    text: like you know you in your brain it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '2729.2'
    text: like oh yeah there this is some there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '2731.64'
    text: something I there&amp;#39;s something I can pull
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '2733.64'
    text: out of this like there&amp;#39;s enough
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '2734.8'
    text: regularity here that it&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '2738'
    text: something that I can pull out
  - dur: '5.559'
    start: '2739.76'
    text: scientifically like this this is
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '2742.16'
    text: tractable this type of data there&amp;#39;s just
  - dur: '3.561'
    start: '2745.319'
    text: there more noisy so there&amp;#39;s nothing
  - dur: '2.72'
    start: '2747.04'
    text: obvious jumping out like this one oh
  - dur: '2.84'
    start: '2748.88'
    text: there&amp;#39;s a structure here it&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '2749.76'
    text: repeating structure it&amp;#39;s like a cyclical
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '2751.72'
    text: thing there&amp;#39;s some kind of s cosine
  - dur: '4'
    start: '2754.119'
    text: nonsense going on I could probably do
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '2755.839'
    text: it&amp;#39;s oriented relative to gravity so
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '2758.119'
    text: there&amp;#39;s just all these kind of like
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '2760.2'
    text: knobs that I can that you can like sink
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '2762.2'
    text: your scientific teeth into to try to
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '2764.48'
    text: figure out what&amp;#39;s going on here whereas
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '2766.48'
    text: these the structure is not quite as
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '2768.04'
    text: obvious you can still see something of
  - dur: '4.481'
    start: '2770.559'
    text: the the jumping just in that shape but
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '2773.72'
    text: that might actually be an error
  - dur: '6.279'
    start: '2775.04'
    text: elsewhere in the pipeline um but you can
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '2778.079'
    text: see I&amp;#39;m kind of like shifting around um
  - dur: '3.081'
    start: '2781.319'
    text: there&amp;#39;s nothing super obvious there and
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '2782.8'
    text: there&amp;#39;s nothing in the task that really
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '2784.4'
    text: makes these Dimensions important again
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '2786.52'
    text: if you had given me the task of I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '2790'
    text: going to put like a penny on the ground
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '2792.2'
    text: and you have to jump up and down only on
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '2794.16'
    text: that Penny then now the deviations from
  - dur: '4.519'
    start: '2798.04'
    text: that point in the X and Y become a part
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '2800.44'
    text: of the behavior and maybe you could look
  - dur: '3.721'
    start: '2802.559'
    text: at sort of you know how I&amp;#39;m Meandering
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '2804.72'
    text: relative to this and that but in this
  - dur: '7.12'
    start: '2806.28'
    text: particular analyses we are going
  - dur: '8.719'
    start: '2809.4'
    text: to ignore X and Y and then focus on
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '2813.4'
    text: Z which is vertical height
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '2819.24'
    text: um yeah so this term here kinetics
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2823.559'
    text: uh this is one of those many kind of
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '2825.96'
    text: like Latin root terms a lot of science
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '2828.079'
    text: is really built on this like let&amp;#39;s find
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '2829.48'
    text: two Latin words that sound very similar
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '2831.319'
    text: and then build an entire field on
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '2833.079'
    text: separating them apart um in this in
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2835.96'
    text: human movement it&amp;#39;s kinematics versus
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '2838.04'
    text: kinetics so kinematics is kind of like
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '2840.48'
    text: this stuff it&amp;#39;s kind of the kinematics
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '2842.92'
    text: is like related to movement so things
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '2845.079'
    text: like joint angles and position and sort
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '2847.76'
    text: of like body posture um the kind of like
  - dur: '4.679'
    start: '2850.4'
    text: the geometry aspects of things is
  - dur: '5'
    start: '2852.4'
    text: wrapped up in kinematics kinetics is
  - dur: '3.801'

  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '2857.4'
    text: start thinking things like force placeat
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '2858.88'
    text: and stuff like that um joint torqus and
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '2861.72'
    text: stuff like that and in this case because
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '2863.92'
    text: we&amp;#39;re looking at the Z Direction in the
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '2865.96'
    text: vertical which aligns with the sort of
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '2868.079'
    text: kinetic or kinetic potential energy sort
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '2870.16'
    text: of trade-off this kind of when we
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '2872.92'
    text: continue to look at that vertical
  - dur: '7'
    start: '2874.44'
    text: Dimension that counts as a kinetic
  - dur: '4.2'

    text: analysis because the units are
  - dur: '6.879'
    start: '2881.96'
    text: Newtons um yeah so then we clean it up
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '2886.319'
    text: this is a butter filter uh don&amp;#39;t stress
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '2888.839'
    text: about that um it just is a smoother and
  - dur: '2.68'
    start: '2891.28'
    text: a cleaner and
  - dur: '7.359'
    start: '2894.2'
    text: a ask the bot about Butterworth filters
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '2897.52'
    text: um if you&amp;#39;re into it one of those like
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '2901.559'
    text: yeah not not this is not the class for
  - dur: '6.199'
    start: '2903.92'
    text: that um
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '2907.4'
    text: oh yeah look this is I think I can&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '3.321'
    start: '2910.119'
    text: remember exactly who wrote this code it
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '2911.2'
    text: wasn&amp;#39;t me it was my former lab manager
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '2913.44'
    text: Michael but you can see here time equals
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2915.599'
    text: 1 over 30 something is now going to come
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '2918.599'
    text: through and convert those frame numbers
  - dur: '5.761'
    start: '2920.119'
    text: into seconds because later on we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5'
    start: '2923.2'
    text: going to likeit like down here um we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '2925.88'
    text: going to be calculating from those Z
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '2928.2'
    text: positions we&amp;#39;re going to be calculating
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '2929.52'
    text: Z velocity and Z acceleration and so
  - dur: '2.88'
    start: '2932.76'
    text: particularly once you get to things like
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '2934.04'
    text: acceleration you kind of want the units
  - dur: '7.08'
    start: '2935.64'
    text: to be second because meters per frame is
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '2939.92'
    text: a measure of velocity but it&amp;#39;s not a
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '2942.72'
    text: particularly useful one um well it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '2945.599'
    text: useful and that it gives you scale but
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '2947.96'
    text: this is also a hardcoded number so
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '2949.76'
    text: you&amp;#39;re just writing the number 30 um
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '2952.52'
    text: this is anytime you you&amp;#39;re in code if
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '2954.559'
    text: you see someone writing a specific
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '2956.68'
    text: number like three
  - dur: '5'
    start: '2959.24'
    text: Z you want to be careful about that like
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '2961.92'
    text: I would prefer to pull the frame rate
  - dur: '5'
    start: '2964.24'
    text: from the data store somewhere so that
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '2966.88'
    text: way if sometime later I start using 60
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '2969.24'
    text: frames per second cameras or 120 frames
  - dur: '2.8'
    start: '2971.48'
    text: per second cameras I have to go
  - dur: '2.72'
    start: '2973.04'
    text: searching for all the places that I
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '2974.28'
    text: wrote the number 30 I want to just be
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '2975.76'
    text: able to pull that out of the data um but
  - dur: '2.92'
    start: '2978.48'
    text: in this case we&amp;#39;re just kind of playing
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '2979.599'
    text: around so we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '2981.4'
    text: fine um what are we doing here
  - dur: '8.28'
    start: '2984.16'
    text: normalizing stuff
  - dur: '9.681'
    start: '2987.079'
    text: and doing stuff where we get velocity oh
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '2992.44'
    text: yeah oh yeah and this
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '2996.76'
    text: we&amp;#39;re getting velocity and acceleration
  - dur: '7.72'
    start: '2998.16'
    text: by taking the diff the this this is your
  - dur: '10.52'
    start: '3001.4'
    text: Calculus real quick um
  - dur: '11'
    start: '3005.88'
    text: so X whatever so if this is
  - dur: '8.24'
    start: '3011.92'
    text: the time and this is z
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '3016.88'
    text: height dot dot dot dot this is the
  - dur: '7.56'
    start: '3020.16'
    text: position in height in space of off the
  - dur: '8.8'
    start: '3023.48'
    text: ground you can diff and p. diff is a
  - dur: '6.839'
    start: '3027.72'
    text: very very stupid um like it&amp;#39;s a dumb
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '3032.28'
    text: dumb calculation that basically just
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '3034.559'
    text: takes the difference so it literally
  - dur: '5.519'
    start: '3036.04'
    text: just says okay for frame this one
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '3039.079'
    text: subtract this one from that one subtract
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '3041.559'
    text: this one from that one subtract this one
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '3043.16'
    text: from that one and then instead of having
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '3046.68'
    text: the Z position on each frame you have
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '3048.839'
    text: the difference between each data point
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '3050.88'
    text: and the one that came before it so you
  - dur: '6'
    start: '3052.96'
    text: have the change in Z position over the
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '3055.4'
    text: duration of time defined by one frame
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3058.96'
    text: and so that is now
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '3061.28'
    text: Delta if we&amp;#39;re doing meters Delta meters
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '3063.96'
    text: over some measure of time that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '7.401'
    start: '3066.599'
    text: velocity and that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s calculus for
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '3069.44'
    text: you um and if you do that same np. diff
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '3074'
    text: to the velocity now you&amp;#39;re getting
  - dur: '6.119'
    start: '3075.48'
    text: change in velocity over a frame duration
  - dur: '6.681'
    start: '3078.599'
    text: of time that&amp;#39;s acceleration again this
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '3081.599'
    text: is np. diff is the uh numerical
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '3085.28'
    text: derivative I guess like for discrete
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '3087.559'
    text: time intervals that&amp;#39;s the same thing
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '3089.72'
    text: when you do calculus you do like the
  - dur: '6.401'
    start: '3091.119'
    text: limits and the the
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '3093.68'
    text: smooth this guy um
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '3097.52'
    text: but in computational numerical land we
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '3100.4'
    text: just do that and call it good
  - dur: '5.881'
    start: '3103.359'
    text: um and then the integral is the same way
  - dur: '6.68'
    start: '3106.04'
    text: you is sort of the opposite thing
  - dur: '9.28'
    start: '3109.24'
    text: that anyways
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '3112.72'
    text: um so yeah so then if you plot it
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '3119.119'
    text: again oh we still don&amp;#39;t have those
  - dur: '7.679'
    start: '3138.68'
    text: numbers I I need to propagate
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3142.359'
    text: this thing
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '3153.68'
    text: okay that&amp;#39;s the plot that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '7.499'
    start: '3163.58'
    text: '[Music]'
  - dur: '7.639'
    start: '3166.44'
    text: that um so I want that to be start oh
  - dur: '3'
    start: '3171.079'
    text: wait
  - dur: '8.399'
    start: '3183.72'
    text: 150 in frame equals was it 1200 is or
  - dur: '7.199'
    start: '3188.92'
    text: whatever and then total body Center of
  - dur: '5.641'
    start: '3192.119'
    text: mass will be start frame to end frame
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '3196.119'
    text: and then all
  - dur: '8.12'
    start: '3197.76'
    text: everything if I do that and that would
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '3201.2'
    text: be a smaller number yes
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '3209.119'
    text: that&amp;#39;s another really common thing to do
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '3211.079'
    text: accidentally which is
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '3213.079'
    text: uh I I had changed that start and end
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '3216.119'
    text: frame
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '3217.359'
    text: stuff um for the visualization but I
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '3220.24'
    text: hadn&amp;#39;t actually clipped out the actual
  - dur: '3.401'
    start: '3223.119'
    text: data so when it got to the next part
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '3224.76'
    text: where it was calculating the velocities
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '3226.52'
    text: it was including all those wacky veloc
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '3228.52'
    text: those wacky sort of garbage frames and
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '3230.799'
    text: if you think about velocity is the
  - dur: '6.801'
    start: '3233.119'
    text: change in position over the the the unit
  - dur: '6.161'
    start: '3236.599'
    text: in time the that one frame where I
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '3239.92'
    text: jumped off to 15,000 mm in back the
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '3242.76'
    text: velocity on that frame is through the
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '3244.48'
    text: roof in the same way because the jump in
  - dur: '6.321'
    start: '3246.599'
    text: position is also crazy literally through
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '3249.319'
    text: the roof I suppose um so now if we do
  - dur: '2.32'
    start: '3252.92'
    text: this
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '3258.119'
    text: again uh that there you go so now it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '7.84'
    start: '3260.44'
    text: more cleaned up
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '3263.559'
    text: um can I look at this
  - dur: '2.359'
    start: '3276.96'
    text: and
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '3281.44'
    text: so let&amp;#39;s see so let&amp;#39;s look at this area
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '3283.839'
    text: right around 400 so this is the Z
  - dur: '9.24'
    start: '3287.48'
    text: position so this is that sort of the the
  - dur: '6.641'
    start: '3290.079'
    text: height position going on there um this
  - dur: '3.761'
    start: '3298.119'
    text: H this is what the velocity of that
  - dur: '5.801'
    start: '3300.599'
    text: looks like
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '3301.88'
    text: so roughly aligned
  - dur: '7.041'
    start: '3307.599'
    text: there and this is what the Z the
  - dur: '4.961'
    start: '3311.799'
    text: acceleration looks like
  - dur: '6.479'
    start: '3314.64'
    text: so and then this is what they look like
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '3316.76'
    text: over overlaid so
  - dur: '6.88'
    start: '3324.28'
    text: um this is one of those PL places
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '3328.799'
    text: where I
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '3331.16'
    text: think I we&amp;#39;re going to get a chance to
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '3333.92'
    text: do this later but like if this was a
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '3336'
    text: perfect
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '3337.079'
    text: measurement um then there should be
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '3340.799'
    text: frames like the frames where I&amp;#39;m off the
  - dur: '8.641'
    start: '3343.119'
    text: ground the acceleration should be
  - dur: '7.52'
    start: '3346.559'
    text: negative 10 m/s down um I&amp;#39;m pretty sure
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '3351.76'
    text: that this actually I can tell you that
  - dur: '3'
    start: '3354.079'
    text: so
  - dur: '7.921'
    start: '3358.039'
    text: so 398 is a peak 398 is down here yeah
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '3363.079'
    text: so this this sort of the low the low
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '3365.96'
    text: part here is the part where I&amp;#39;m in
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '3368.48'
    text: ballistic flight and the fact that
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '3370.48'
    text: there&amp;#39;s a little hump there tells you
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '3373.079'
    text: that the data is sort of incorrect in
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '3375.319'
    text: some way either my center of mass is not
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '3377.839'
    text: being calculated perfectly or in this
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '3380'
    text: case I think that the the the world is
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '3382.16'
    text: tilted a little bit like the ground
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '3383.88'
    text: plane is not actually flat here it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '3386.48'
    text: slightly tilted which I think is also
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '3388.44'
    text: the reason why you&amp;#39;re getting the sort
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3392.16'
    text: of like the jump squiggles are sort of
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '3394.4'
    text: still present in the X and Y because you
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '3396.16'
    text: think about jumping on a a slanted
  - dur: '3.759'
    start: '3398.28'
    text: ground plane then even though you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '3400.48'
    text: booving up and down in space you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.921'
    start: '3402.039'
    text: going to sort of see some of that in the
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '3403.72'
    text: x and y axis and I know that because I
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '3405.96'
    text: wrote this code and I know that that is
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '3407.359'
    text: the sort of that part of the code has
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '3409.24'
    text: some slop to it
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '3412.28'
    text: um
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '3414.96'
    text: but but yeah
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '3417.16'
    text: so this
  - dur: '6.881'
    start: '3419.039'
    text: is so we can now sort of Chunk this
  - dur: '3'
    start: '3422.92'
    text: out
  - dur: '7.321'
    start: '3426.319'
    text: um and start looking at
  - dur: '7.839'
    start: '3429.96'
    text: like using this data can start to like
  - dur: '6.399'
    start: '3433.64'
    text: get particular layers
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '3437.799'
    text: of I don&amp;#39;t know why I always like

    text: anytime I have a plan that involves the
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '3441.64'
    text: word and I should just scrap it and have
  - dur: '2.76'
    start: '3444.359'
    text: two things like it&amp;#39;s already four o&amp;#39;
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '3445.76'
    text: like we&amp;#39;re not have time for the other
  - dur: '4.041'
    start: '3447.119'
    text: thing but like are we going to do this
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '3449'
    text: and that it&amp;#39;s like I I&amp;#39;m starting to
  - dur: '3.6'
    start: '3451.16'
    text: recognize it but I don&amp;#39;t use it to
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '3452.52'
    text: change my behavior so we&amp;#39;ll we&amp;#39;ll figure
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '3454.76'
    text: that out
  - dur: '4.521'
    start: '3456.359'
    text: um but yeah so using this so for example
  - dur: '3'
    start: '3459.799'
    text: one of the things you might want to know
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '3460.88'
    text: when you&amp;#39;re jumping very very simple
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '3462.799'
    text: dumb analysis is how many times did I
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '3465.76'
    text: jump right if you&amp;#39;re just saying say the
  - dur: '3.561'
    start: '3468.599'
    text: task was jump as many times as you can
  - dur: '3.399'
    start: '3469.92'
    text: in 30 seconds or jump as many times you
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '3472.16'
    text: can until you want to stop or something
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '3473.319'
    text: like that just being able to count these
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '3475.48'
    text: jumps would be something really helpful
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '3477.88'
    text: um you could just go through an eyeball
  - dur: '3.441'
    start: '3479.799'
    text: it you just cramp them by hand but
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '3482'
    text: that&amp;#39;s first of all not going to be very
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '3483.24'
    text: reliable and secondly won&amp;#39;t scale like
  - dur: '3.68'
    start: '3485.52'
    text: if you&amp;#39;re doing a bigger analysis you
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '3487'
    text: want to be able to automate
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '3489.2'
    text: that
  - dur: '7.68'
    start: '3491.119'
    text: um
  - dur: '8.361'
    start: '3494.039'
    text: and yeah various ways of doing that
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '3498.799'
    text: and in this particular case uh I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '3502.4'
    text: pretty sure now this was Michael writing
  - dur: '7.64'
    start: '3503.88'
    text: this code um he he&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '8.44'
    start: '3507.72'
    text: identifying uh peaks in that jump as
  - dur: '8.799'
    start: '3511.52'
    text: zero Crossings in the velocity um in
  - dur: '6.8'
    start: '3516.16'
    text: particular looking at this stage
  - dur: '6.601'
    start: '3520.319'
    text: so uh because if
  - dur: '7.2'
    start: '3522.96'
    text: you think about the velocity of a curve
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '3526.92'
    text: like this can I zoom in on
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '3530.359'
    text: that
  - dur: '7.6'
    start: '3532.28'
    text: um up down so I&amp;#39;m accelerating upwards
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '3536.119'
    text: so it&amp;#39;s positive velocity and then I hit
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '3539.88'
    text: the Apex and then
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '3541.799'
    text: I&amp;#39;m going downward so it&amp;#39;s negative
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '3544.28'
    text: velocity so there&amp;#39;s a zero Crossing
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '3546.599'
    text: there um
  - dur: '5.479'
    start: '3549.64'
    text: between positive velocity and negative
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '3552.52'
    text: velocity that corresponds to the peak of
  - dur: '6.081'
    start: '3555.119'
    text: that jump and that&amp;#39;s nice to have um
  - dur: '3.559'
    start: '3559.48'
    text: because if you&amp;#39;re trying to identify the
  - dur: '2.879'
    start: '3561.2'
    text: peak of this jump you can actually
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '3563.039'
    text: actually looking at this data you can
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '3564.079'
    text: actually do that pretty easily um um but
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '3568.359'
    text: there&amp;#39;s always going to be a point like
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3570.319'
    text: for this data point here like this one&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '2.84'
    start: '3573.92'
    text: pretty obvious this is probably the one
  - dur: '3.201'
    start: '3575.319'
    text: you want to Peak but pick but if you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '3.359'
    start: '3576.76'
    text: trying to pick just the highest one like
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '3578.52'
    text: there can be these kind of ambiguous
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '3580.119'
    text: moments because you&amp;#39;re looking for like
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '3582'
    text: a like a it needs to be a particular
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '3583.76'
    text: number so that&amp;#39;s where PL things like
  - dur: '3.439'
    start: '3586.16'
    text: converting into something like velocity
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '3588.16'
    text: allows you to look for something like a
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '3589.599'
    text: zero Crossing where the data goes from
  - dur: '3.359'
    start: '3592.68'
    text: positive number to a negative number and
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '3594.359'
    text: then that becomes a very easy thing to
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '3596.039'
    text: to pick out of the data
  - dur: '3.319'
    start: '3599.52'
    text: um
  - dur: '4.521'
    start: '3601.119'
    text: and
  - dur: '7.321'
    start: '3602.839'
    text: representing this is also
  - dur: '8.32'
    start: '3605.64'
    text: a I think if I re calculate this yeah um
  - dur: '6.199'
    start: '3610.16'
    text: here&amp;#39;s another quick tip for data
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '3613.96'
    text: visualizations this this is a bad
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '3616.359'
    text: representation of data it&amp;#39;s fine and
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '3618.92'
    text: this is him showing okay we using that
  - dur: '3.881'
    start: '3621.119'
    text: velocity analysis you can find the peaks
  - dur: '3.361'
    start: '3623.119'
    text: of each jump then you can just count the
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '3625'
    text: number of those and know how many times
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '3626.48'
    text: you jumped but this yellow on white no
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '3629.24'
    text: one not doing anyone any favors so we
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '3632.4'
    text: are going to go in here this is highle
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '3635.44'
    text: program you see where it says yellow I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '9'
    start: '3637.2'
    text: going change that to a different color
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '3640.28'
    text: say magenta magenta magent
  - dur: '7.279'
    start: '3646.76'
    text: magenta there we go or let&amp;#39;s say
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '3652.28'
    text: red
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3654.039'
    text: sure um
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '3656.599'
    text: yeah and so now we have the number of
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '3659.039'
    text: steps here just going to say this out
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '3660.799'
    text: loud when you&amp;#39;re doing data if you have
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '3663.319'
    text: healthy color vision you will very
  - dur: '4.161'
    start: '3666.079'
    text: quickly go to red and green as the
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '3668.079'
    text: colors to se to show two different
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '3670.24'
    text: groups you&amp;#39;re not allowed to use red and
  - dur: '4.241'
    start: '3672.039'
    text: green 10% of the population is color
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '3674.079'
    text: blind so if you if this if these were
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '3676.28'
    text: green lines with red dots then I my 10%
  - dur: '3.919'
    start: '3679.44'
    text: of my audience cannot see that color
  - dur: '5.159'
    start: '3681.2'
    text: distinction so think just look for any
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '3683.359'
    text: other so red red blue is good you know
  - dur: '6.121'
    start: '3686.359'
    text: blue yellow well not that yellow blue
  - dur: '6.68'
    start: '3688.96'
    text: orange anyways uh think about color
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '3692.48'
    text: blind people um this is also a good
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '3695.64'
    text: example of despite the fact that we had
  - dur: '3.04'
    start: '3698.4'
    text: that pretty nice algorithm for finding
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '3700.16'
    text: the peaks of those
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '3701.44'
    text: jumps it finds a bunch of jumps right
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '3704.4'
    text: here because it found because the
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '3706.72'
    text: algorithm&amp;#39;s kind of dumb it&amp;#39;s just
  - dur: '5.401'
    start: '3708.039'
    text: looking for zero Crossings and so when I
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3711.359'
    text: am just standing here you know I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '3713.44'
    text: moving a little bit and it&amp;#39;s finding
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '3716.359'
    text: those points and so if we&amp;#39;re naive in
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '3719.24'
    text: the way that we do this we&amp;#39;re going to
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '3721.319'
    text: count five extra jumps at the beginning
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '3724'
    text: that didn&amp;#39;t actually occur and then if
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '3726.039'
    text: we wanted to look at an analysis of like
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '3727.96'
    text: okay you know is there is there a
  - dur: '3.801'
    start: '3730.119'
    text: fatigue effect where the jumps are
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '3731.44'
    text: getting slower over time let&amp;#39;s take the
  - dur: '4'
    start: '3733.92'
    text: let&amp;#39;s look at the the average height of
  - dur: '4.321'
    start: '3736.079'
    text: the first half of the jumps and the last
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '3737.92'
    text: half of the jumps if you&amp;#39;re not careful
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '3740.4'
    text: then you&amp;#39;re going to include these fake
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '3742.76'
    text: jumps in your calculation of mean height
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '3745.48'
    text: and now going to get a really wacky
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '3747.039'
    text: result which is that the first the the
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '3749.799'
    text: average jump height of the first half of
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '3751.4'
    text: the recording is super low and then the
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '3754.079'
    text: second half is super high because you
  - dur: '6.439'
    start: '3755.88'
    text: have not appropriately cleaned out the
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '3758.559'
    text: false data here so you know this is one
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '3762.319'
    text: of those things that&amp;#39;s super obvious
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '3763.799'
    text: when you&amp;#39;re looking at it but less so if
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '3767.24'
    text: you&amp;#39;re not careful about how you do your
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '3769.039'
    text: analyses so you would want to have um a
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '3772.52'
    text: different way of clipping off and sort
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '3773.64'
    text: of to the question from before like this
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '3776.92'
    text: is one of those cases too like if I&amp;#39;m
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '3778.52'
    text: writing an automated algorithm to clip
  - dur: '6.68'
    start: '3781.48'
    text: off the the beginning and end of the
  - dur: '6.639'
    start: '3784.64'
    text: data um it&amp;#39;s really hard to write that
  - dur: '6.28'
    start: '3788.16'
    text: kind of analysis in a way that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '3791.279'
    text: going to get this like I can just go
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '3794.44'
    text: through and say oh yeah right it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.041'
    start: '3796.359'
    text: here like you can just look at it and
  - dur: '3'
    start: '3797.96'
    text: say this is where the data should start
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '3799.4'
    text: and so I can just go through and find
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '3800.96'
    text: that frame whereas if I&amp;#39;m writing some
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '3803.44'
    text: sort of algorithm that&amp;#39;s saying oh look
  - dur: '3.721'
    start: '3805.039'
    text: for this flat part in the middle how
  - dur: '4.241'
    start: '3807.279'
    text: confident am I that I&amp;#39;m going to be able
  - dur: '4.519'
    start: '3808.76'
    text: to get it right there and not right
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '3811.52'
    text: there that&amp;#39;s going to lead two of these
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '3813.279'
    text: like fake jumps in there alternatively I
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '3816.24'
    text: can have a more robust method for
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '3817.88'
    text: finding those Peaks that has in addition
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '3820.96'
    text: to that like velocity zero Crossing it
  - dur: '4.439'
    start: '3823.16'
    text: also just has a minimum threshold height
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '3825.44'
    text: so the thres you have to be above a
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '3827.599'
    text: certain height and doing a zero Crossing
  - dur: '2.92'
    start: '3829.96'
    text: for it to count as a jump but then you
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '3831.68'
    text: have to ask the question how do you know
  - dur: '5.719'
    start: '3832.88'
    text: what that height is and da da it&amp;#39;s whole
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '3835.799'
    text: part of the game we&amp;#39;ll figure it
  - dur: '3'
    start: '3838.599'
    text: out
  - dur: '6'
    start: '3842.92'
    text: um yes and then
  - dur: '3.561'
    start: '3845.359'
    text: again those red
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '3850.44'
    text: stars
  - dur: '8'
    start: '3852.079'
    text: he yeah so we believe that those red
  - dur: '10.48'
    start: '3855'
    text: stars correspond to the apex of the
  - dur: '8.48'
    start: '3860.079'
    text: jump um and this is that same data in
  - dur: '3.079'
    start: '3865.48'
    text: the acceleration
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '3870.76'
    text: space there we go yeah
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '3874.52'
    text: so this little humpy thing at the bottom
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '3877'
    text: here is in fact the the ballistic flight
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '3879.24'
    text: phase so this is again showing that
  - dur: '6.599'
    start: '3880.76'
    text: there&amp;#39;s some sort of Squish in the data
  - dur: '6.639'
    start: '3883.48'
    text: um now again from a data visualization
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '3887.359'
    text: perspective uh Michael was not doing you
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '3890.119'
    text: guys any favors because he well he was
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '3893.039'
    text: doing you many many favors I suppose but
  - dur: '7.079'
    start: '3894.76'
    text: one of the things he didn&amp;#39;t do is
  - dur: '6.159'
    start: '3897.96'
    text: maintain a consistent representation of
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '3901.839'
    text: maintain consistent coloring because
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '3904.119'
    text: here he established this sort of like
  - dur: '4.72'
    start: '3906.72'
    text: position is red velocity is green
  - dur: '6'
    start: '3908.359'
    text: acceleration is blue um but then when he
  - dur: '5.679'
    start: '3911.44'
    text: plotted it later blue is the default
  - dur: '6.401'
    start: '3914.359'
    text: color so he didn&amp;#39;t he didn&amp;#39;t maintain
  - dur: '5.521'
    start: '3917.119'
    text: those colors throughout so this one oh
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '3920.76'
    text: this is actually is this velocity I
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3922.64'
    text: think that&amp;#39;s labeled wrong what is
  - dur: '3'
    start: '3924.64'
    text: velocity
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '3928'
    text: anyways doesn&amp;#39;t matter um so that was
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '3931.079'
    text: now velocity which is blue and this is
  - dur: '4.441'
    start: '3933.279'
    text: now acceleration which is blue which
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '3935.839'
    text: from a visualization
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '3937.72'
    text: perspective uh there&amp;#39;s nothing different
  - dur: '3.401'
    start: '3940.799'
    text: about it the shapes aren&amp;#39;t different but
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '3942.52'
    text: in terms of like if you&amp;#39;re trying to use
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '3944.2'
    text: this data to communicate a particular
  - dur: '4.8'
    start: '3946.799'
    text: thing to an audience maintaining those
  - dur: '5.599'
    start: '3949.76'
    text: color consistencies can be be really
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '3951.599'
    text: friendly on the brain um but for now we
  - dur: '5'
    start: '3955.359'
    text: don&amp;#39;t have to to worry about
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '3957.799'
    text: it
  - dur: '5.92'
    start: '3960.359'
    text: okay so
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '3962.68'
    text: now we get to the a little bit of time
  - dur: '2.961'
    start: '3966.279'
    text: the end figure it
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '3974.76'
    text: out okay so
  - dur: '6.201'
    start: '3977.319'
    text: now I&amp;#39;m going to take a bit of a a spin
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '3980.88'
    text: here so this is again just a part of the
  - dur: '3.519'
    start: '3983.52'
    text: analyses that you can look at all the
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '3984.92'
    text: time so say like you know and these just
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '3987.039'
    text: different ways of interrogating the data
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '3989.44'
    text: putting things into position velocity
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '3991.4'
    text: acceleration and sort of finding these
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '3994.4'
    text: and I think one of the thing that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '6.401'
    start: '3995.599'
    text: happening with the with the red stars is
  - dur: '5.799'
    start: '3999'
    text: finding particular features in say the
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4002'
    text: velocity signal identifying those frame
  - dur: '4.401'
    start: '4004.799'
    text: numbers as saying oh this is where the
  - dur: '5.759'
    start: '4006.52'
    text: peak of the jump is and then plotting
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '4009.2'
    text: those same points overlaid on different
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '4012.279'
    text: analyses so the red star so it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '4014.839'
    text: hard to deter
  - dur: '4.601'
    start: '4016.839'
    text: in actually yeah
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '4018.799'
    text: so um he didn&amp;#39;t so you could have done a
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '4021.44'
    text: similar analysis so this is basically
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '4023.68'
    text: liftoff oh yeah it says right there
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '4025.119'
    text: liftoff um so this Frame or close to it
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '4028.64'
    text: is the the part where the feet left the
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '4030.68'
    text: ground you could do a similar type of
  - dur: '5.961'
    start: '4032.799'
    text: analysis to get TouchDown um and that
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '4036.319'
    text: would then tell you that everything
  - dur: '6.039'
    start: '4038.76'
    text: between lift off and touchdown is on the
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '4041.64'
    text: ground so now even though we know that
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '4044.799'
    text: the that sort of ballistic data is like
  - dur: '7.121'
    start: '4047.279'
    text: not accurate in some way because you
  - dur: '6.521'
    start: '4050.119'
    text: know the this wiggle cannot B physics
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '4054.4'
    text: says that didn&amp;#39;t happen so if this is
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '4056.64'
    text: there that means there&amp;#39;s something wrong
  - dur: '6.519'
    start: '4057.76'
    text: with the data representation which is
  - dur: '8.76'
    start: '4059.92'
    text: fine um but we could look at if we knew
  - dur: '7.481'
    start: '4064.279'
    text: the the the contact portion of the jumps
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '4068.68'
    text: then we then this part of the curve is
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '4071.76'
    text: the place where my nervous system is
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '4074.24'
    text: putting Force into the gra round um this
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '4077.039'
    text: is the part where I&amp;#39;m landing and
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4079.039'
    text: absorbing force and this is the part
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '4081.319'
    text: where I&amp;#39;m I&amp;#39;m taking off again so using
  - dur: '4.24'
    start: '4084.559'
    text: this kind of way of doing the data you
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '4086.559'
    text: could chop out all of those contact
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '4088.799'
    text: phases and sort of do some estimations
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '4091.64'
    text: and analyses of the um the processes
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '4095.319'
    text: going in
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4096.279'
    text: there
  - dur: '6.721'
    start: '4100.239'
    text: um yeah and then you know keep on doing
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '4102.6'
    text: that forever uh
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '4107.239'
    text: uh and then the rest of this starts
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '4110.279'
    text: getting into a place that I find
  - dur: '7.44'
    start: '4112.839'
    text: particularly fun and evocative and
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '4115.719'
    text: pretty um which starts to show so
  - dur: '3.721'
    start: '4120.279'
    text: everything up until this point even
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '4122.279'
    text: though the behavior as we know has this
  - dur: '7.799'
    start: '4124'
    text: kind of repetitive phasic structure um
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '4128.679'
    text: we&amp;#39;ve been representing time linearly um
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '4131.799'
    text: and so by phase I mean just literally
  - dur: '5.959'
    start: '4133.88'
    text: like there is a contact phase and there
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '4136.56'
    text: is a flight phase so there&amp;#39;s two phases
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4139.839'
    text: you might or you might chop it up even
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '4141.92'
    text: more than that say the contact phase has
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '4144.359'
    text: two phases there is the compression and
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '4146.799'
    text: then there&amp;#39;s the extension phase um you
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '4149.199'
    text: could say that the the flight phase has
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '4151.64'
    text: a as a rising phase and a falling phase
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '4155.319'
    text: but you could also if you wanted to you
  - dur: '6.799'
    start: '4158.4'
    text: could chunk out these times and use that
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '4162.359'
    text: to sort of break down the sorry let let
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '4165.199'
    text: me back up a bit so
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '4167.199'
    text: the so we so we know that the behavior
  - dur: '3.441'
    start: '4169.679'
    text: has this kind of like phasic kind of
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '4171.159'
    text: cyclic sort of circular type of
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '4173.12'
    text: structure to it but the representation
  - dur: '6.201'
    start: '4175.239'
    text: we have here isn&amp;#39;t showing that time is
  - dur: '6.801'
    start: '4177.679'
    text: progressing linearly from start to end
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '4181.44'
    text: so from time equals z to time equals
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '4184.48'
    text: bigger than zero in that
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '4186.88'
    text: direction so if we wanted to convert
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '4189.04'
    text: that into a more phasic structure that
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4191.279'
    text: sort of represents that that repeated
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '4193.199'
    text: Behavior more we have to do
  - dur: '6.48'
    start: '4196.199'
    text: some some
  - dur: '7.719'
    start: '4197.96'
    text: trickery um Step One is
  - dur: '3'
    start: '4202.679'
    text: identifying
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '4205.88'
    text: um yeah identifying a discrete moment in
  - dur: '3.44'
    start: '4210.32'
    text: particular you want of if there&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '4212.08'
    text: phasic thing happening like repeating
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '4213.76'
    text: structure you want to have some way of
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '4215.64'
    text: defining the beginning of a phase like
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '4218.04'
    text: what is the what is what is so if we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4220.4'
    text: going from like 0 to Pi 0 to 2 pi we
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '4224.08'
    text: going in a circle or something like that
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '4225.44'
    text: that what is zero in that in that phasic
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '4229.4'
    text: structure with a calendar we have we
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4232.08'
    text: call that zero January first um that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '4235'
    text: the time of the calendar where the
  - dur: '5.88'
    start: '4237.08'
    text: number resets uh for a clock we call
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '4239.96'
    text: that time midnight it resets and it goes
  - dur: '5.6'
    start: '4242.96'
    text: back it goes if you&amp;#39;re counting in
  - dur: '7.88'
    start: '4244.64'
    text: military time it goes from like 23 59 59
  - dur: '6.76'
    start: '4248.56'
    text: back to zero again um in this case it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '4252.52'
    text: pretty reasonable to you could pick any
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '4255.32'
    text: number you could pick any point in this
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '4257.08'
    text: but picking that lift off as time equals
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '4259.679'
    text: zero seems like a
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '4261.12'
    text: reasonable place to to do that
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '4264.4'
    text: chopping um so we can go through if we
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '4267.08'
    text: wanted
  - dur: '7'
    start: '4269.239'
    text: to
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '4271.44'
    text: and take all of these
  - dur: '5.921'
    start: '4278.159'
    text: oops take all of these cycles and clip
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '4281.52'
    text: them according to their starting time
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '4284.08'
    text: and then overlay them on top of each
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '4285.719'
    text: other and then you would
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '4293.4'
    text: see you know it would look something
  - dur: '2.48'
    start: '4296.4'
    text: what would look
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '4310.52'
    text: like so if you were to Overlay all those
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '4312.8'
    text: jumps on top of each other and call now
  - dur: '3.879'
    start: '4315.28'
    text: zero is just this star you would see
  - dur: '3.441'
    start: '4317.679'
    text: this kind of repeating structure on top
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '4319.159'
    text: of itself and then sort of then you
  - dur: '5.119'
    start: '4321.12'
    text: could try to line things up that way um
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '4323.52'
    text: you can also start representing this
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '4326.239'
    text: stuff in a non-spatial way so this is
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '4329.84'
    text: this is actually a Time series so it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '4331.12'
    text: actually not spatial but the the the the
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '4334.04'
    text: skeleton guy and the dot guy those are
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '4336.88'
    text: all kind of spatial representations but
  - dur: '6.92'
    start: '4338.52'
    text: when we were talking about representing
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '4341.56'
    text: stuff with plots um
  - dur: '3.799'
    start: '4345.44'
    text: I talked about like you know you can do
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '4346.84'
    text: X Y and Z to do you know two dimensions
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '4349.239'
    text: and three dimensions but then at some
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4351.12'
    text: point I said that some like that using
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '4353.96'
    text: spatial Dimensions to represent the data
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '4356.12'
    text: is not really necessary um you can do
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '4359.12'
    text: any color any number of things on the
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '4361.52'
    text: plot
  - dur: '5.041'
    start: '4363.239'
    text: um
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '4364.88'
    text: and you can start representing this okay
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4368.28'
    text: I&amp;#39;m going to talk about this just so you
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '4370.08'
    text: know this is like this like gets into
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '4373.32'
    text: the kind of like robotics the
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4374.48'
    text: engineering stuff that like you&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '6'
    start: '4376.84'
    text: unlikely to encounter again for a while
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '4379'
    text: unless you seek it out um but uh this
  - dur: '7.56'
    start: '4382.84'
    text: starts getting into like State space
  - dur: '9.52'
    start: '4385.52'
    text: representation um where if you can
  - dur: '7.44'
    start: '4390.4'
    text: Define the the the state of the system
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '4395.04'
    text: in a small number of numbers then you
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '4397.84'
    text: can represent those numbers in a plot
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '4400.28'
    text: and sort of see the relationship between
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '4402'
    text: them and so what does that mean exactly
  - dur: '5.719'
    start: '4405.52'
    text: let let&amp;#39;s think about this in terms of
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '4408.84'
    text: the jumping Behavior and the the numbers
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '4411.239'
    text: that we have decided are important for
  - dur: '3.8'
    start: '4413.8'
    text: that behavior so there is this stage
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '4415.8'
    text: where we have to use our big human
  - dur: '4.84'

    text: measurable numbers in the system that
  - dur: '7.32'
    start: '4422.44'
    text: I&amp;#39;m currently looking at and this one of
  - dur: '6'
    start: '4425.48'
    text: the jumping has this nice feature where
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '4429.76'
    text: we actually kind of boiled it down to
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4431.48'
    text: the point where there&amp;#39;s only a
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '4433.28'
    text: singular sort of basic number that we
  - dur: '4.839'
    start: '4436.4'
    text: really care about and that&amp;#39;s the Z
  - dur: '6.12'
    start: '4438.4'
    text: position um however we then made these
  - dur: '5.721'
    start: '4441.239'
    text: kind of like derived numbers of velocity
  - dur: '4.159'
    start: '4444.52'
    text: and acceleration which we also think are
  - dur: '2.96'
    start: '4446.96'
    text: very important for understanding the
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '4448.679'
    text: kind of like the physics and the
  - dur: '7.319'
    start: '4449.92'
    text: mechanics of this jumping
  - dur: '7.681'
    start: '4452.239'
    text: behavior um so if we&amp;#39;re thinking about
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '4457.239'
    text: this the the jumping human we want to
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '4459.92'
    text: say okay at any given moment in time
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '4462.32'
    text: what are some numbers that I really want
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '4463.8'
    text: to know about this
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '4465.6'
    text: object that will help me sort of
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '4467.88'
    text: understand what it&amp;#39;s doing we can start
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '4471'
    text: by saying I want to know the position
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '4472.84'
    text: and I want to know the velocity and
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '4474.88'
    text: we&amp;#39;ll get to the acceleration in a
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '4477.159'
    text: second and
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '4480.12'
    text: so and so then just in the same way that
  - dur: '3.159'
    start: '4483'
    text: if we wanted to plot this spatially we
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '4484.56'
    text: could take the XYZ position of the
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '4486.159'
    text: center mass and put it in some sort of
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '4488.679'
    text: three dimension representation we can
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '4490.92'
    text: also make a plot where the x axis we&amp;#39;re
  - dur: '2.64'
    start: '4494.36'
    text: going to call
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '4497.04'
    text: position and the y- axis we&amp;#39;re going to
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '4499.28'
    text: call
  - dur: '7.52'
    start: '4500.44'
    text: velocity and so at any moment in time
  - dur: '9.039'
    start: '4503.6'
    text: you can say okay your your Z position is
  - dur: '6.6'
    start: '4507.96'
    text: 12 and your velocity is three and so
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '4512.639'
    text: this is your current state at that
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '4514.56'
    text: moment in time then we can look at the
  - dur: '4.079'
    start: '4517.56'
    text: next time step and say okay well your
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '4519.4'
    text: position let&amp;#39;s see your velocity is
  - dur: '4.201'
    start: '4521.639'
    text: positive so your position is going to be
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '4523.84'
    text: up but your velocity is also going to be
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '4525.84'
    text: dropping because you&amp;#39;re on the air and
  - dur: '4.2'
    start: '4528.12'
    text: so now you&amp;#39;re going to be there and so
  - dur: '6.319'
    start: '4529.88'
    text: you can go through each frame and sort
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '4532.32'
    text: of identify the state and then put a
  - dur: '3.321'
    start: '4536.199'
    text: data put the put the put a point on
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '4538.159'
    text: there and then connect the dots because
  - dur: '6.119'
    start: '4539.52'
    text: you know what time is
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '4542'
    text: yeah I promise you it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '4551.96'
    text: not I think so yeah like there&amp;#39;s a lot
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '4554.6'
    text: of things
  - dur: '6.521'
    start: '4556.239'
    text: like spatial
  - dur: '8.48'
    start: '4558.48'
    text: intuition um we&amp;#39;re very good at that
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '4562.76'
    text: um understanding ballistics and
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '4566.96'
    text: understanding velocity like there is
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '4569.32'
    text: this very deep intuitive gut checky
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '4572.32'
    text: level where we are all super super good
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '4574.4'
    text: at that like your ability to like jog up
  - dur: '3.24'
    start: '4577.56'
    text: the stairs catch a ball like all of
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '4579.96'
    text: those
  - dur: '4.16'
    start: '4580.8'
    text: things it&amp;#39;s kind of like so the like the
  - dur: '3.12'
    start: '4583.48'
    text: language that you use like are we really
  - dur: '3.08'
    start: '4584.96'
    text: really good at calculus it&amp;#39;s like no no
  - dur: '3.559'
    start: '4586.6'
    text: no we&amp;#39;re not all like really good at
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '4588.04'
    text: calculus because calculus is this weird
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '4590.159'
    text: and specific formalism where these all
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '4592.6'
    text: these like rules of like symbols and
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '4595.239'
    text: stuff like that that is but but we are
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4598.28'
    text: good at what calculus is attempting to
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '4600.36'
    text: represent which is like values that
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '4602.8'
    text: change over time and so this is
  - dur: '4.641'
    start: '4604.679'
    text: something that I&amp;#39;m always kind of trying
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '4606.36'
    text: to to present in these types of sort of
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '4609.32'
    text: weird
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4610.76'
    text: conversations is trying to hit that
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4613.08'
    text: intuitive level of these things without
  - dur: '3.2'
    start: '4615.76'
    text: getting bogged down in the numbers and
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '4617.6'
    text: the math and the sort of like the
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '4618.96'
    text: testable values um I think this is one
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '4621.52'
    text: of like the main the main harms that we
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '4624.6'
    text: do with our stupid way of doing
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4626.239'
    text: education is because we have this kind
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '4628.44'
    text: of filtration model where education is
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '4631.159'
    text: meant to like filter out people who
  - dur: '5.881'
    start: '4633.639'
    text: can&amp;#39;t hack it we we present this stuff
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '4636.4'
    text: in a way that&amp;#39;s hard on purpose so that
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '4639.52'
    text: we can tell who can pass through the
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '4642.12'
    text: filters that we&amp;#39;ve arbitrarily defined
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '4643.8'
    text: the stuff um and so people kind of have
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '4646.76'
    text: this sense of like oh the math is hard
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '4648.56'
    text: the the you know calculus is hard these
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '4650.719'
    text: sort of weird values are are difficult
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4653.159'
    text: um but that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s something that we
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '4655.199'
    text: did as a society because we&amp;#39;re bad at
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '4658.159'
    text: educating on mass or rather I think
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '4660.52'
    text: we&amp;#39;ve outgrown older forms of education
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '4663.08'
    text: on mass but that&amp;#39;s like I said this a
  - dur: '4.68'
    start: '4665.12'
    text: couple classes ago like if you&amp;#39;re like
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '4667.679'
    text: if you&amp;#39;re like oh this makes sense to me
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '4669.8'
    text: you do understand calculus um you may
  - dur: '3.161'
    start: '4673.159'
    text: just you may not know all the formalism
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '4675.04'
    text: of it you may not know how to make your
  - dur: '5.359'
    start: '4676.32'
    text: Calculus Professor happy um but if if
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4679.88'
    text: position if change in position over time
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '4681.679'
    text: equals velocity makes sense if change in
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '4684.4'
    text: velocity over time is is acceleration
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '4687'
    text: makes sense that is calculus and
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '4689.679'
    text: everything else beyond that is just like
  - dur: '5.239'
    start: '4691.44'
    text: weird syntactic formalisms so and it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '4695'
    text: sort of one of these like you hear
  - dur: '6.241'
    start: '4696.679'
    text: roboticist talking about this a lot of
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '4698.76'
    text: like you know here we are with billion
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '4702.92'
    text: dollars wor the military funds trying to
  - dur: '4.559'
    start: '4705.12'
    text: make a robot do the most basic thing in
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '4707.32'
    text: the world and then here we and then and
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '4709.679'
    text: yet we have like three and fouryear olds
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '4711.4'
    text: just zipping around a playground doing
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '4713.32'
    text: all this stuff like once you really
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '4715.48'
    text: start this is also kind of like you know
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '4719.12'
    text: human as robot is kind of like a way
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '4720.92'
    text: that I try to make sense of like the the
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '4723.44'
    text: complexity of human Mo movement is this
  - dur: '6.64'
    start: '4725.8'
    text: kind of like weird this weird activity
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '4729.28'
    text: of like trying to boil down these really
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '4732.44'
    text: basic really intuitive behaviors
  - dur: '3.679'
    start: '4735.48'
    text: and really think about those lowl
  - dur: '5.8'
    start: '4737.08'
    text: physics as if you were to build a robot
  - dur: '6.361'
    start: '4739.159'
    text: that could do this um and often times
  - dur: '5.759'
    start: '4742.88'
    text: you just like like how do we know that
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '4745.52'
    text: this is stable but that is less stable
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '4748.639'
    text: like how do you know that this is this
  - dur: '7'
    start: '4750.56'
    text: is more likely to fall than that
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '4753.96'
    text: like we all do but actually nailing that
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '4757.56'
    text: down in some way that&amp;#39;s interpretable
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '4759.32'
    text: and you know grounded very very
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '4762.52'
    text: difficult this thing&amp;#39;s even transparent
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '4764.52'
    text: so like who even knows there&amp;#39;s fluids in
  - dur: '2.239'
    start: '4767.48'
    text: it
  - dur: '3.76'
    start: '4770.08'
    text: Jesus the world is too complicated needs
  - dur: '6.92'
    start: '4772.719'
    text: to be
  - dur: '8.52'
    start: '4773.84'
    text: simplified um okay so State space right
  - dur: '4.281'
    start: '4779.639'
    text: at any moment in time there is a state
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '4782.36'
    text: and if you can Define that state in a
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '4783.92'
    text: small number of numbers then for every
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '4785.88'
    text: moment in time you can put a dot on this
  - dur: '3.521'
    start: '4788.239'
    text: thing that represents this is where I am
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '4790.52'
    text: at time
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '4791.76'
    text: equals 12 and this is where I am time
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '4795.04'
    text: equals 13 and this is where I am at time
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4797.08'
    text: equals 14 this is where I am at time
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '4798.6'
    text: equals 16 and so you can basically draw
  - dur: '3.28'
    start: '4801.08'
    text: these
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '4802.239'
    text: trajectories in state
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '4804.36'
    text: space that hypothetically represent the
  - dur: '5'
    start: '4807.56'
    text: relationship between these values and so
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '4810.44'
    text: in particular and so things can kind of
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '4812.56'
    text: emerge from that when you plot that
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '4814.36'
    text: stuff that will sort of highlight
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '4816.84'
    text: intuitions that could be hard to
  - dur: '6.879'
    start: '4818.8'
    text: identify in other formats so like we
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '4823.36'
    text: know because have these sort of gut
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '4825.679'
    text: checks of physics and because we&amp;#39;ve been
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '4827.639'
    text: talking about like ballistic movement
  - dur: '4.64'
    start: '4829.8'
    text: and stuff like that that there is a
  - dur: '5.561'
    start: '4831.719'
    text: relationship between the position and
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4834.44'
    text: height and the and the velocity like the
  - dur: '5.959'
    start: '4837.28'
    text: Z height and Z position Z velocity are
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '4839.96'
    text: related to each other in some way and so
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '4843.239'
    text: we kind of eyeball it in this time
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4845.04'
    text: series format but what would it look
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '4847.36'
    text: like if we could just plot position on
  - dur: '6.679'
    start: '4849.96'
    text: one axis and velocity on the other axis
  - dur: '3.519'
    start: '4853.12'
    text: especially during this type of behavior
  - dur: '5.601'
    start: '4856.719'
    text: avior
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '4859.6'
    text: and the answer
  - dur: '6.879'
    start: '4862.32'
    text: hypothetically plot this
  - dur: '3.359'
    start: '4865.84'
    text: here is
  - dur: '6.72'
    start: '4871.88'
    text: that so this I don&amp;#39;t know why it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '4874.76'
    text: showing up like that
  - dur: '5.041'
    start: '4887.239'
    text: so this
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '4889'
    text: is this representation for the jump
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '4892.28'
    text: stuff and so and I guess the velocity
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '4895.44'
    text: here is on the x axis and the position
  - dur: '6.92'
    start: '4897.84'
    text: is on the Y is on the Z position is on
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4900.76'
    text: the vertical axis
  - dur: '5.24'
    start: '4905.08'
    text: and the pink dots here are the apex of
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '4908.6'
    text: the jump so that&amp;#39;s at your highest
  - dur: '7.44'
    start: '4910.32'
    text: position and then the hard to see maroon
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '4915.56'
    text: dot here is the the bottom of the jump
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '4917.76'
    text: and then this Green Dot here is the
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '4919.6'
    text: liftoff phase um and so you can see so
  - dur: '6.36'
    start: '4923.08'
    text: this is a state space representation
  - dur: '8.12'
    start: '4925.32'
    text: because every dot on this curve
  - dur: '7.04'
    start: '4929.44'
    text: represents the the state of the center
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '4933.44'
    text: of mass system um at a particular moment
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '4936.48'
    text: in time but it&amp;#39;s not a spatial
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '4938.36'
    text: representation there&amp;#39;s nothing in space
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '4940.84'
    text: here because the x axis is velocity
  - dur: '5.039'
    start: '4943.12'
    text: that&amp;#39;s not you can&amp;#39;t do that like in
  - dur: '4.761'
    start: '4946.679'
    text: space you can kind of cheat but
  - dur: '4.921'
    start: '4948.159'
    text: otherwise not but you can see that this
  - dur: '3.279'
    start: '4951.44'
    text: this there&amp;#39;s something intuitive about
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '4953.08'
    text: this representation this thing that we
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '4954.719'
    text: always that we knew that there&amp;#39;s a
  - dur: '4.84'
    start: '4956.44'
    text: repeated cycle going on is now
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '4958.84'
    text: represented here and we can see for
  - dur: '6.399'
    start: '4961.28'
    text: example that the Peaks are much more
  - dur: '7'
    start: '4963.92'
    text: lined up than the the liftoffs right
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '4967.679'
    text: because this liftoff is being defined
  - dur: '2.84'
    start: '4970.92'
    text: there&amp;#39;s something in my nervous system
  - dur: '4'
    start: '4972.4'
    text: that&amp;#39;s deciding this there&amp;#39;s something
  - dur: '5.28'
    start: '4973.76'
    text: in the the complicated stuff going on
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '4976.4'
    text: here and we could if we really wanted to
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '4979.04'
    text: convert this from a a state space to a
  - dur: '6'
    start: '4982.96'
    text: proper phase space where now the phase
  - dur: '5.72'
    start: '4985.88'
    text: space will be something that actually
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '4988.96'
    text: sort of rotates around the unit circle
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '4991.6'
    text: and has sort of like you know thetas and
  - dur: '6.679'
    start: '4994.48'
    text: fi in it and stuff like
  - dur: '7.239'
    start: '4996.48'
    text: that um or we could just keep going and
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '5001.159'
    text: make make things even wackier and just
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '5003.719'
    text: keep adding numers because this is a
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '5005.96'
    text: two-dimensional State space but there&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '5007.8'
    text: obviously way more possible numbers we
  - dur: '6.241'
    start: '5010.159'
    text: could bake in to the state of a system
  - dur: '4.08'
    start: '5013.84'
    text: remember this thing has probably like 43
  - dur: '3.279'
    start: '5016.4'
    text: numbers you would need to Define its
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '5017.92'
    text: state because it&amp;#39;s got you know joint
  - dur: '5.241'
    start: '5019.679'
    text: number times three or whatever um but in
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '5023.239'
    text: this case we have an obvious third
  - dur: '5.319'
    start: '5024.92'
    text: number and that&amp;#39;s acceleration and we
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '5027.159'
    text: believe for good reasons that things
  - dur: '5.201'
    start: '5030.239'
    text: like the Z position the Z velocity and Z
  - dur: '5.719'
    start: '5032.44'
    text: acceleration are all coupled in some way
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '5035.44'
    text: and lucky for us we have an additional
  - dur: '3.761'
    start: '5038.159'
    text: spatial Dimension to plot and this
  - dur: '2.88'
    start: '5040.52'
    text: two-dimensional plot can become a
  - dur: '3.16'
    start: '5041.92'
    text: threedimensional plot where now the
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '5043.4'
    text: third axis will be
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '5045.08'
    text: acceleration and that I
  - dur: '5.84'
    start: '5048'
    text: believe will show up
  - dur: '7.681'
    start: '5050.719'
    text: here and I really wish this would
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '5053.84'
    text: show make this
  - dur: '5'
    start: '5060.199'
    text: LLY I don&amp;#39;t know how to make that show
  - dur: '3'
    start: '5062.199'
    text: up
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '5069.12'
    text: I don&amp;#39;t know why this
  - dur: '4.88'
    start: '5071.88'
    text: is
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '5074.28'
    text: anyways do
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '5076.76'
    text: this yeah there we
  - dur: '7.24'
    start: '5080.04'
    text: go and so there oh now we&amp;#39;re bouncing
  - dur: '8'
    start: '5083.28'
    text: around so that&amp;#39;s what that looks
  - dur: '4'
    start: '5087.28'
    text: like uh
  - dur: '3.759'
    start: '5094.48'
    text: yeah this is we were getting off of
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '5096.36'
    text: Michael&amp;#39;s map too that&amp;#39;s where you got
  - dur: '5.321'
    start: '5098.239'
    text: question marks there and I wish I could
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '5099.84'
    text: put this in a more visible space but
  - dur: '6.32'
    start: '5103.56'
    text: this is one of those so that the the
  - dur: '4.28'
    start: '5105.6'
    text: height here is acceleration oh
  - dur: '10.92'
    start: '5115.44'
    text: Jesus sure um and so now this
  - dur: '9.04'
    start: '5122.199'
    text: is a a 3D State space representation of
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '5126.36'
    text: that repeative jumping behavior
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '5131.679'
    text: um oh I see got
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '5137.159'
    text: this and I wish I had set this up to
  - dur: '3.599'
    start: '5141.04'
    text: plot in a bigger format but that&amp;#39;s fine
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '5143.119'
    text: I personally really hate Jupiter
  - dur: '7.56'
    start: '5144.639'
    text: notebooks but they are useful in some
  - dur: '7.24'
    start: '5147.84'
    text: cases uh but yeah so this this is
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '5152.199'
    text: the this this is the thre Dimension this
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '5155.08'
    text: is a three-dimensional State space plot
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '5157.28'
    text: of the center of mass kinetics over this
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '5160.52'
    text: repeated jumping pattern and this if we
  - dur: '5.881'
    start: '5163.159'
    text: wanted to we could look and
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '5165.48'
    text: analyze aspects of this shape in similar
  - dur: '3.72'
    start: '5169.04'
    text: ways that we would analyze
  - dur: '4.319'
    start: '5170.4'
    text: three-dimensional spatial trajectories
  - dur: '4.32'
    start: '5172.76'
    text: and say things that may or may not be
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '5174.719'
    text: related to the actual Behavior now for
  - dur: '3.2'
    start: '5177.08'
    text: this particular
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '5178.4'
    text: Behavior I kind of think this is where
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '5180.28'
    text: the analysis tends to kind of Peter out
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '5182.36'
    text: like just the quality of the data is not
  - dur: '5.399'
    start: '5184.76'
    text: particularly great the the experimental
  - dur: '6.759'
    start: '5186.96'
    text: design was had left something to be
  - dur: '6.681'
    start: '5190.159'
    text: desired um but I do think that this is
  - dur: '5.761'
    start: '5193.719'
    text: sort of like Jesus other than the
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '5196.84'
    text: technical issues um this there&amp;#39;s like
  - dur: '4.639'
    start: '5199.48'
    text: something beautiful about this and just
  - dur: '4.801'
    start: '5201.199'
    text: the way that it represents this kind of
  - dur: '3.56'
    start: '5204.119'
    text: like intuitive sense of what was going
  - dur: '3.4'
    start: '5206'
    text: on in that behavior like you can look at
  - dur: '3.161'
    start: '5207.679'
    text: it you can say okay there&amp;#39;s a repeated
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '5209.4'
    text: thing happening here there&amp;#39;s a cycle
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '5210.84'
    text: that&amp;#39;s occurring and I want to know
  - dur: '5'
    start: '5213.32'
    text: things about that cycle and how that
  - dur: '6.879'
    start: '5215.28'
    text: rates relates to some other factors that
  - dur: '6.319'
    start: '5218.32'
    text: are going on and what we just went
  - dur: '5.121'
    start: '5222.159'
    text: through
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '5224.639'
    text: um in the full class time because that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '5.64'
    start: '5227.28'
    text: how it always tends to go um was again a
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '5230.32'
    text: series of analyses all of these analyses
  - dur: '5.719'
    start: '5232.92'
    text: by the way on the back end of the other
  - dur: '6.08'
    start: '5235.8'
    text: pipeline that we described last
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '5238.639'
    text: time to represent the data in a format
  - dur: '4'
    start: '5241.88'
    text: that kind of captures that cyclical
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '5243.719'
    text: structure and if we really wanted to we
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '5245.88'
    text: could kind of look at this and other
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '5247.36'
    text: formats and keep going from
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '5249.36'
    text: there um but and because we were so
  - dur: '6.2'
    start: '5251.88'
    text: careful and to to maintain that sort of
  - dur: '5.32'
    start: '5254.48'
    text: like epistemological chain from the base
  - dur: '3.48'
    start: '5258.08'
    text: sort of voltages on the back of the
  - dur: '4'
    start: '5259.8'
    text: camera through each stage of the
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '5261.56'
    text: pipeline through the magic box step of
  - dur: '4.52'
    start: '5263.8'
    text: the of tracking the person in the image
  - dur: '5'
    start: '5266.6'
    text: and through all the other geometry and
  - dur: '6.24'
    start: '5268.32'
    text: computation and you know unit conversion
  - dur: '5.639'
    start: '5271.6'
    text: and stuff like that we can believe that
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '5274.56'
    text: there is in in the same sense that we
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '5277.239'
    text: believe that there is some relationship
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '5279.159'
    text: between the image from the camera and
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '5281.32'
    text: the reality of what happens at that
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '5283.119'
    text: point in time now two weeks ago uh where
  - dur: '4.759'
    start: '5286.48'
    text: the the organism in question was
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '5288.48'
    text: behaving in space we can believe that
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '5291.239'
    text: the the shape and structure of this
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '5294'
    text: representation also has that grounding
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '5296.52'
    text: in this relationship to that behavior
  - dur: '6.4'
    start: '5298.92'
    text: that we recorded some weeks
  - dur: '6.44'
    start: '5302.08'
    text: ago um
  - dur: '4.359'
    start: '5305.32'
    text: yeah and so this type of this sort of
  - dur: '4.4'
    start: '5308.52'
    text: State space
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '5309.679'
    text: representation it again like I don&amp;#39;t
  - dur: '3.92'
    start: '5312.92'
    text: know how much it&amp;#39;s going to come up in
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '5314.159'
    text: your daily lives for you know a little
  - dur: '4.6'
    start: '5316.84'
    text: while unless you sort of stick into the
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '5319'
    text: the the gritty parts of science um but
  - dur: '6.52'
    start: '5321.44'
    text: you see this this method for represent
  - dur: '6.92'
    start: '5324.52'
    text: representing complex
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '5327.96'
    text: high-dimensional uh data or behaviors or
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '5331.44'
    text: sort of questions in a lot of different
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '5333.48'
    text: places you see it in robotics so
  - dur: '4'
    start: '5335.88'
    text: oftentimes with robotics if you if you
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '5337.52'
    text: think about like a multi-joint arm and
  - dur: '6.759'
    start: '5339.88'
    text: you think about like you know shoulder
  - dur: '5.76'
    start: '5343.04'
    text: shoulder angle uh elbow angle wrist
  - dur: '4.881'
    start: '5346.639'
    text: angle and you sort of plot those onto
  - dur: '5.2'
    start: '5348.8'
    text: this thing then a given arm trajectory
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '5351.52'
    text: will map a given trajectory in that
  - dur: '6.119'
    start: '5354'
    text: space so even if you have a
  - dur: '6.84'
    start: '5356.56'
    text: high-dimensional sort of robotic element
  - dur: '5.841'
    start: '5360.119'
    text: um I think these days people are getting
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '5363.4'
    text: people really like um reinforcement
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '5365.96'
    text: learning stuff like that
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '5368.199'
    text: but uh often times like robotic
  - dur: '5'
    start: '5370.88'
    text: movements are deci are defined Within
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '5373.36'
    text: These sort of State spaces and phase
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '5375.88'
    text: spaces and again there is nothing
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '5378.44'
    text: special about the number three other
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '5381.44'
    text: than that&amp;#39;s how many spatial Dimensions
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '5383.56'
    text: we have if we wanted to plot a 45
  - dur: '3.839'
    start: '5386.36'
    text: dimensional State space we could do that
  - dur: '4.599'
    start: '5388.6'
    text: we just can&amp;#39;t look at it all at the same
  - dur: '4.681'
    start: '5390.199'
    text: time and so Robotics trajectories are
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '5393.199'
    text: often plotted in those space spaces you
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '5394.88'
    text: also see it in uh neural data so if
  - dur: '6'
    start: '5397.159'
    text: you&amp;#39;re recording from you know 100 a
  - dur: '3.641'
    start: '5400.719'
    text: th000 neurons in the visual cortex while
  - dur: '3.08'
    start: '5403.159'
    text: you&amp;#39;re displaying something or another
  - dur: '3.64'
    start: '5404.36'
    text: to the monkey you might want to know
  - dur: '4.081'
    start: '5406.239'
    text: about the the firing of each of those
  - dur: '4.119'
    start: '5408'
    text: neurons relative to each other so you
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '5410.32'
    text: could again Define a certain State space
  - dur: '5.961'
    start: '5412.119'
    text: and say okay for neurons one to 100 you
  - dur: '5.56'
    start: '5415.36'
    text: know on the scale from resting firing
  - dur: '5.52'

    text: each neuron in that space if you think
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '5423.6'
    text: about a simple case you only have three
  - dur: '5.08'
    start: '5425.639'
    text: neurons if you show a stimulus to the
  - dur: '4.04'
    start: '5428.56'
    text: monkey you can look at how the different
  - dur: '3.681'
    start: '5430.719'
    text: neurons firing rates relate to each
  - dur: '3.84'
    start: '5432.6'
    text: other and look at the structures that
  - dur: '3.759'
    start: '5434.4'
    text: come around from these types of plots
  - dur: '4.719'
    start: '5436.44'
    text: and sort of try to use that to interpret
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '5438.159'
    text: what&amp;#39;s going on at the at the neural
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '5441.159'
    text: level
  - dur: '4.121'
    start: '5442.719'
    text: um before we go just I&amp;#39;m going to drop
  - dur: '3.961'
    start: '5445.119'
    text: some just jargon terms real quick if
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '5446.84'
    text: you&amp;#39;re interested in this stuff poner
  - dur: '7.36'
    start: '5449.08'
    text: sections is a is a classic term it&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '7.319'
    start: '5452.36'
    text: been um it a p a point section is
  - dur: '7.4'
    start: '5456.44'
    text: basically if you take a slice through
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '5459.679'
    text: this um this sort of dut shape uh the
  - dur: '5.279'
    start: '5463.84'
    text: plunk aray section is sort of like where
  - dur: '3.759'
    start: '5465.36'
    text: all those points connect so if you were
  - dur: '6.04'
    start: '5469.44'
    text: to
  - dur: '6.56'
    start: '5471.119'
    text: basically um take a slice here then the
  - dur: '4.56'
    start: '5475.48'
    text: shape of the sort of intersections with
  - dur: '5.681'
    start: '5477.679'
    text: that plane would be the plk array
  - dur: '4.76'
    start: '5480.04'
    text: section um you could also do like time
  - dur: '3.52'
    start: '5483.36'
    text: locking so so this one is just sort of
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '5484.8'
    text: allowed to swing around you could also
  - dur: '6.16'
    start: '5486.88'
    text: chop it down so that let&amp;#39;s say each of
  - dur: '4.879'
    start: '5490.32'
    text: these Green Dots is sort of like slammed
  - dur: '4.199'
    start: '5493.04'
    text: to zero and then see how the shape
  - dur: '5.281'
    start: '5495.199'
    text: changes often times when you do that
  - dur: '6.601'
    start: '5497.239'
    text: like if you align the time base to some
  - dur: '5.199'
    start: '5500.48'
    text: relevant sort of feature different
  - dur: '3.399'
    start: '5503.84'
    text: things will emerge sometimes things will
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '5505.679'
    text: clean up and sort of condense and you
  - dur: '6.841'
    start: '5507.239'
    text: can sort of look at things that way
  - dur: '5.44'
    start: '5510.84'
    text: um and yeah this is
  - dur: '3.88'
    start: '5514.08'
    text: we when we show up before class and
  - dur: '4.12'
    start: '5516.28'
    text: there then the previous class has all
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '5517.96'
    text: like the crazy math on the board that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '2.92'
    start: '5520.4'
    text: that&amp;#39;s differential equations that&amp;#39;s
  - dur: '4.799'
    start: '5521.92'
    text: kind of like that&amp;#39;s what this stuff
  - dur: '5.879'
    start: '5523.32'
    text: starts to get into pretty quickly um but
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '5526.719'
    text: just to be clear I can&amp;#39;t do any of that
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '5529.199'
    text: math any of that board math I got
  - dur: '5.081'
    start: '5531.199'
    text: nothing on that I can probably write
  - dur: '5.36'
    start: '5533.04'
    text: code that does similar things to that
  - dur: '3.959'
    start: '5536.28'
    text: board math but if you sat me down and
  - dur: '5.04'
    start: '5538.4'
    text: said calculate the integral of some this
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '5540.239'
    text: that or the other like I got I I got
  - dur: '3.96'
    start: '5543.44'
    text: nothing you can all probably if any of
  - dur: '3.841'
    start: '5545.199'
    text: you have taken a math class in the past
  - dur: '3'
    start: '5547.4'
    text: five years actually probably not five
  - dur: '3.199'
    start: '5549.04'
    text: you&amp;#39;re pretty young but if you&amp;#39;ve taken
  - dur: '4.239'
    start: '5550.4'
    text: a math class at this school you could
  - dur: '4.561'
    start: '5552.239'
    text: probably math me out of the water on
  - dur: '3.721'
    start: '5554.639'
    text: paper um I just never learned how to do
  - dur: '4.399'
    start: '5556.8'
    text: that my bachelor&amp;#39;s degree is in
  - dur: '6.799'
    start: '5558.36'
    text: philosophy um but you can back your way
  - dur: '5.361'
    start: '5561.199'
    text: in with the intuition and you can learn
  - dur: '3.601'
    start: '5565.159'
    text: the co you can learn how to do it in
  - dur: '3.639'
    start: '5566.56'
    text: code and event like the nice thing about
  - dur: '3.2'
    start: '5568.76'
    text: math is once you get good enough at it
  - dur: '4.721'
    start: '5570.199'
    text: you don&amp;#39;t have to do it anymore you can
  - dur: '4.92'
    start: '5571.96'
    text: just kind of write the code that does it
  - dur: '4.279'
    start: '5574.92'
    text: and the the phase of that process where
  - dur: '5.16'
    start: '5576.88'
    text: you actually like I am now back to the
  - dur: '4.44'
    start: '5579.199'
    text: point where I I I write the math on
  - dur: '3.36'
    start: '5582.04'
    text: paper to help me write the code better
  - dur: '4.361'
    start: '5583.639'
    text: but I promise you I wasn&amp;#39;t doing that
  - dur: '5.839'
    start: '5585.4'
    text: for the first like decade or so that I
  - dur: '5.96'
    start: '5588'
    text: was converting my life from philosophy
  - dur: '4.96'
    start: '5591.239'
    text: major to science
  - dur: '3.759'
    start: '5593.96'
    text: person
  - dur: '4.841'
    start: '5596.199'
    text: um
  - dur: '5.52'
    start: '5597.719'
    text: Okay cool so that&amp;#39;s data that&amp;#39;s movement
  - dur: '4.48'
    start: '5601.04'
    text: data that&amp;#39;s probably that&amp;#39;s the last
  - dur: '4.521'
    start: '5603.239'
    text: moap stuff we&amp;#39;re going to look at unless
  - dur: '4.36'
    start: '5605.52'
    text: somebody wants to dig deeper into it um
  - dur: '5.68'
    start: '5607.76'
    text: I think next week we&amp;#39;re going to focus
  - dur: '5.239'
    start: '5609.88'
    text: more on the like honing your ideas and I
  - dur: '4.239'
    start: '5613.44'
    text: want to end I want to end next week with
  - dur: '6.321'
    start: '5615.119'
    text: y&amp;#39;all having like three papers on your
  - dur: '5.48'
    start: '5617.679'
    text: topic versus the one um and then
  - dur: '3.32'
    start: '5621.44'
    text: probably after that we&amp;#39;ll
  - dur: '5.161'
    start: '5623.159'
    text: move
  - dur: '5.12'
    start: '5624.76'
    text: into vision and eyeballs and I&amp;#39;ll bring
  - dur: '6.96'
    start: '5628.32'
    text: in an eye tracker and we&amp;#39;ll look at my
  - dur: '5.4'
    start: '5629.88'
    text: eyeballs and it&amp;#39;ll be weird um yeah
