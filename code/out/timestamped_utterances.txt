00:00 we&amp;#39;re recording now um so to repeat that
00:04 um the the proper assignment like the
00:07 the proper proper like poster proposal
00:09 assignment will be on uh like a one or
00:13 two sentence right up on the topic area
00:15 that you&amp;#39;re going to want your poster to
00:17 be on and a singular citation of a paper
00:21 that kind of represents what that
00:24 research what what what that like
00:27 research in the area that you&amp;#39;re going
00:28 to be presenting on um um the standard
00:31 assignment for 22.99 is that you&amp;#39;re
00:33 supposed to pick a singular paper for
00:35 the whole semester and then your poster
00:37 is going to be you presenting just that
00:39 paper um I think we can go a little bit
00:42 beyond that if that&amp;#39;s all you want to do
00:44 that&amp;#39;s totally valid um but I think we
00:46 can do a little bit more broad of a of
00:48 an overview um
00:51 and uh but to keep us kind of honest
00:54 we&amp;#39;re just I&amp;#39;m going to ask you to to
00:56 pick a singular paper and then the the
00:59 bot me mediated conversation will be
01:02 sort of designed to help you do that so
01:05 if you you know give it say here&amp;#39;s the
01:07 topic I want to study um here&amp;#39;s a paper
01:09 I&amp;#39;m thinking about here&amp;#39;s the abstract
01:11 um I&amp;#39;ll prompt I&amp;#39;ll make the bot
01:13 prompted to kind of like ask you the
01:14 kind of questions um that you know I
01:17 would ask you if I have the time and
01:19 energy to kind of sit down and talk
01:21 about it um behind the curtain when they
01:24 talk about this class uh the most of
01:29 what they tell us to do is try to help
01:31 you guys not pick a review article for
01:34 your paper and to pick an actual proper
01:37 like Empirical research article like
01:39 because it&amp;#39;s really it&amp;#39;s like like if
01:42 you just go search for papers on a given
01:44 topic you&amp;#39;re going to find review
01:45 articles at the top of that list and
01:46 it&amp;#39;s not always super obvious whether
01:49 you&amp;#39;re looking at a review article or a
01:50 book chaper or like an empirical study
01:54 um so I can tell the bot to help you
01:57 with that uh and it&amp;#39;ll do things like
01:59 asking you about the methodologies and
02:01 topics and stuff like that so just kind
02:03 of like helping you kind of like parse
02:05 the very very dense language that an
02:07 abstract or scientific papers typically
02:08 written in um and so then there will be
02:10 some like sort of like simple check boxy
02:12 style of canvas assignment and then like
02:15 a Discord server based conversation
02:18 space there um and those will be
02:21 ostensibly um do um next week so end of
02:27 next week meaning 11:59
02:30 p.m. on Sunday before the following
02:33 Monday and if you don&amp;#39;t hit that
02:34 deadline there will be dire
02:36 consequences um not really but it&amp;#39;s sort
02:40 of we wanted to keep kind of in that
02:43 General Cadence that the that we&amp;#39;re all
02:45 kind of like on the same path
02:50 um
02:51 and
02:53 probably probably by the end of this
02:56 next week is when the I will have
03:00 implemented the stuff where the bot will
03:01 be kind of like keeping track of a
03:03 profile of your interests and trying to
03:04 like help in the journey that you will
03:07 take through this General field
03:12 um but we&amp;#39;ll see anytime I make a
03:15 promise about the future just know
03:17 internally I am
03:21 screaming
03:27 um great
03:37 okay off up okay who cares
03:47 um yes
03:50 okay let&amp;#39;s go ahead and get into
03:54 it
03:56 um I know what to do
04:00 methods I realized I forgot um Mo
04:05 cap tracking
04:09 Etc
04:20 okay I also forgot a piece of equipment
04:23 that I intended to bring today uh so I
04:25 will use this instead
04:33 someone doesn&amp;#39;t know how
04:36 to great that
04:39 works all
04:48 righty
04:50 okay so let us begin the lecture proper
04:57 um so
04:59 it&amp;#39;s been nice for the first part of
05:01 this class kind of seeing you guys
05:03 talking about your interest in the
05:06 server you know kind of talking to the
05:07 bot about what you&amp;#39;re into and what you
05:09 want to study and things like that um
05:13 and I I intentionally wanted to have
05:16 that part happen first before I kind of
05:18 talk about my own talk too much about my
05:20 own
05:21 particular sort of map of this space um
05:25 because I I didn&amp;#39;t want
05:27 to uh
05:30 I wanted to let you guys kind of like
05:32 think about it for yourselves before I
05:34 came up and did like the like the
05:36 traditional Professor thing which is to
05:38 tell you here&amp;#39;s what this field is and
05:39 here&amp;#39;s what this means and here&amp;#39;s what
05:41 the here&amp;#39;s what is on topic here&amp;#39;s what
05:43 is off topic um because I generally
05:45 don&amp;#39;t think that that&amp;#39;s how we should
05:48 think about intellectual inquiry um and
05:53 the next chunk of time I&amp;#39;m going to give
05:56 you an overview of this domain of human
06:01 centered Neuroscience um that is mostly
06:04 related to my own particular history my
06:07 own research background my own the
06:10 studies that I&amp;#39;ve done um and anytime
06:13 that you you know by the time that you
06:15 have sort of lived long enough to have
06:17 Specialties and personal experiences and
06:20 whatnot you will have sort of charted
06:22 your own path and trajectory Into the
06:24 Heart of some field or some domain um
06:28 and for pretty much all of you you know
06:30 for everyone that sort of chooses to
06:32 follow a route kind of like that um you
06:35 are going to have a sort of unique path
06:38 like everybody&amp;#39;s path is going to be
06:39 different and everybody&amp;#39;s sort of the
06:42 the the topics that are relevant to
06:44 everybody&amp;#39;s interest will all will be
06:46 will be different um
06:49 so I don&amp;#39;t want to present this stuff in
06:52 the sense that in a sense of saying here
06:55 is everything that matters here is
06:56 everything that is relevant to this
06:58 topic um I I really want to keep it kind
07:01 of on that like relatively personalized
07:05 Narrative of these are the topics that
07:08 are the most important for me to be able
07:11 to study human human perceptual motor
07:14 Neuroscience in the ways that I
07:16 specifically have learned how to do
07:19 um and sort of talking about that in
07:22 that Con in that context of like the the
07:26 the component pieces of my particular
07:28 specialty um and I think the beauty of
07:30 using sort of AI mediated Tools in a
07:35 classroom setting is that in a
07:37 traditional class the professor kind of
07:40 like lays out the curriculum lays out
07:42 the structure lays out the topic area
07:44 and then you are all kind of constrained
07:46 to follow that structure um and that&amp;#39;s
07:49 largely for practical reasons like it&amp;#39;s
07:51 just it&amp;#39;s just too hard and it requires
07:53 too much human labor to like really
07:55 mediate and like sort of navigate the
07:58 particular um sort of variations of
08:01 interest of people in a room even even a
08:04 room that is labeled under a particular
08:05 course title um but I think with the AI
08:09 you know limited though it may be it
08:12 will always do a do its damnedest to
08:15 sort of make whatever your interests are
08:18 relevant to the topics that I have
08:22 mandated it should care about um so as I
08:25 start going through this stuff uh just
08:30 encouraging you to really learn to key
08:33 in to like your own personal feelings of
08:37 interest in your own personal feelings
08:38 of like being drawn or snagged or moved
08:43 by some topic or some domain um and you
08:48 know if you want to follow the
08:49 trajectories that I&amp;#39;m doing that&amp;#39;s all
08:52 well and good but even if you wanted to
08:54 you wouldn&amp;#39;t it wouldn&amp;#39;t happen that way
08:56 because that&amp;#39;s not how the world Works
08:58 um and so as I give this sort of lecture
09:03 um my main request for you is to just
09:07 not let your brain turn all the way off
09:09 I&amp;#39;m going to be talking fast about a lot
09:11 of sort of topics that are going to be
09:13 relatively unfamiliar um for some of
09:15 them they might be the first time you&amp;#39;ve
09:17 heard about it for some of them you
09:18 might have heard about it before uh the
09:21 goal is not to have you understand
09:23 everything that I&amp;#39;m saying the goal is
09:25 to just expose you to it um so as I
09:28 start sort of blah blah bling at you
09:32 um don&amp;#39;t get too hung up on whether or
09:35 not you&amp;#39;re following everything just
09:36 kind of like remember the words as much
09:38 as you can try to let just try to let it
09:40 wash over you I promise you nonzero of
09:44 it will be attaching um and then when we
09:48 kind of open things back up
09:50 uh you can start asking the bot asking
09:54 your neighbors the questions about the
09:55 parts that were the most interesting to
09:57 you and the part that I have found the
10:00 most gratifying about doing this type of
10:02 a class is the Discovery every time
10:04 empirically that when I give a lecture
10:07 on a given topic and then I say to 40
10:11 students ask the bot about the parts you
10:13 found most interesting typically what I
10:15 see from that is 40 different
10:18 conversations about 40 different topics
10:20 and that&amp;#39;s really a lot of fun
10:24 um
10:25 so with that said let us get get into it
10:30 um unfortunately
10:34 I I
10:36 brought I intended to bring a um like a
10:39 tablet so I could like draw like stuff
10:43 with colors um and I brought the tablet
10:45 but then when I looked for like the the
10:47 pen part I found I just thrown like this
10:51 like standard pencil into here which I
10:53 can&amp;#39;t even I can&amp;#39;t even imagine what was
10:56 going on when I did that so we&amp;#39;re just
10:59 doing we&amp;#39;re going to do it old school
11:01 with unfortunately just a singular color
11:02 but that&amp;#39;s
11:04 okay
11:06 um let&amp;#39;s see move over
11:12 here
11:16 so was your
11:20 fault how dare you okay I&amp;#39;ll just I&amp;#39;ll
11:24 put it on your bill
11:28 um um
11:31 um okay
11:35 so right so the topic of the course is
11:38 neuroscience the the department is
11:39 biology and most of you as biology
11:42 majors and whatnot have internalized to
11:47 some degree or another with validity
11:50 that biology and Neuroscience are things
11:52 are is is Rel is related to things like
11:54 cells and neurons and wet lab microscope
12:00 types of conversations and stuff like
12:02 that super valid super good topics good
12:05 things to look at um and all kind of
12:10 part and parcel with a particular
12:12 philosophical tradition that is so
12:15 fundamental to the way that we do
12:17 scientific research in
12:20 2025 in Earth um that we often don&amp;#39;t
12:25 even think about it and that is the
12:26 concept of reductionism that&amp;#39;s not your
12:28 way
12:30 um so reductionism is just sort of a
12:32 general philosophical approach to the
12:35 study of the natural world um which
12:37 tries to break things down into smaller
12:41 and smaller pieces so that with you can
12:43 sort of make more and more precise
12:44 measurements and more more precise
12:46 topics more more precise investigations
12:48 but this kind of like sort of like
12:50 implicit assumption that at some point
12:53 there will be that by looking at the
12:54 component pieces of the world you&amp;#39;ll be
12:57 able to get a sense of the istic view of
13:00 how everything works um and there&amp;#39;s a
13:03 lot of validity to that approach but
13:04 there&amp;#39;s also obviously a lot of
13:06 limitations to that um because if you&amp;#39;re
13:08 only looking at the small pieces in
13:10 isolation you never going to see or
13:13 you&amp;#39;re going to have a hard time seeing
13:15 what we call emergent properties which
13:17 are things that only really come about
13:19 when you look at the the combination of
13:21 things at a larger scale than the kind
13:24 of things you can put into a test tube
13:26 and under a microscope um the classic
13:29 example of emergence is traffic um so
13:32 traffic is a property of cars on a road
13:36 um but you can never understand traffic
13:37 by looking at a singular car it&amp;#39;s
13:39 something that only really comes about
13:41 when you&amp;#39;re looking at the cars
13:42 operating in
13:43 their natural environment
13:47 um and so you know the the counter to
13:52 reductionism is what you might call more
13:55 holism or something like that um
13:59 but that tends to be the scale that my
14:04 sort of research domain tends to operate
14:06 in is I I tend not to be like I look at
14:09 the research of the people who are doing
14:11 the highly reduced sort of like
14:13 electrophysiology studies where they put
14:15 electrodes into the brains of various
14:17 animals um fmri where they have people
14:19 in a tube and they&amp;#39;re looking at the
14:21 magnetic resonance of their hemoglobin
14:23 in their brain um but my particular
14:27 domain of research tends to focus on
14:29 humans behaving in natural environments
14:33 doing um the kinds of stuff that we do
14:36 in our sort of day-to-day lives so you
14:38 know like throwing things in the air and
14:40 catching them involves there&amp;#39;s a motor
14:42 behavior of putting Force into the
14:44 marker an information gathering phase
14:48 and then another motor command which if
14:50 it lines up with the
14:51 world works out if it doesn&amp;#39;t I drop it
14:55 um
14:57 and large sort of trying to understand
15:01 that behavioral process um in its
15:05 natural context and then trying to use
15:08 whatever the best measurements that I
15:10 can come up with um of those behaviors
15:13 and then trying to attach them to sort
15:15 of the more low-level reductionist sort
15:17 of um fields of inquiry so that we can
15:21 have a sense of like you know how the
15:23 things like cells and neurons can lead
15:26 to complex behaviors like that so I
15:30 think of it as kind of like it&amp;#39;s almost
15:31 like a robotics approach so it&amp;#39;s I like
15:33 to tell people that I studi the part of
15:35 Neuroscience that overlaps with robotics
15:38 um because robotics is another field
15:41 that kind of like keeps you honest in
15:43 the sense that it&amp;#39;s you make things that
15:45 move around in the real world so you
15:47 can&amp;#39;t really cut that many corners so
15:48 the thing just stops working um and the
15:52 difference is that the like robots we
15:56 know how they work because we made them
15:58 but we they can&amp;#39;t do all the things we
16:00 want humans we don&amp;#39;t really know how
16:02 they work but they can do pretty much
16:03 anything so there&amp;#39;s this kind of
16:05 combination of those two sort of
16:07 thinking about the human as like a
16:09 magical meat robot and trying to study
16:11 it and understand it from the that
16:14 perspective um can lead to a lot of
16:17 useful results um and the nice thing
16:21 about that is kind of the abstraction
16:24 away from the biology and from the the
16:28 the knowledge that it is in fact under
16:30 the hood cells and neurons and you know
16:33 membrane potentials and things like that
16:35 um and thinking about it more in the
16:37 terms of the things that we can measure
16:39 um which we will talk about shortly
16:43 um so let&amp;#39;s
16:47 talk so speaking of the natural world
16:50 let&amp;#39;s sort of talk about something
16:53 which you know is one of the ways to
16:56 parse out that General topic which is
16:58 what&amp;#39;s called the perception Action
17:00 Cycle um
17:07 so let&amp;#39;s start by drawing a brain I&amp;#39;m
17:12 trying to draw
17:14 it I&amp;#39;m
17:19 draw yes let&amp;#39;s do it like that um so
17:22 here&amp;#39;s how you draw a
17:25 brain there you go
17:32 um
17:35 the sorry try and you&amp;#39;ll figure it out
17:40 okay so this is your brain this is a
17:43 picture of your brain that&amp;#39;s your
17:45 temporal lobe this is your eye you&amp;#39;re
17:47 facing that way
17:51 um and there&amp;#39;s a lot of details that are
17:54 not being covered here but this is the
17:55 general shape so here you are that&amp;#39;s
17:59 your that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s you and you existence
18:03 in the
18:04 world
18:06 and let&amp;#39;s
18:14 see let&amp;#39;s do this different
18:22 way there you go that&amp;#39;s you you&amp;#39;re in
18:26 the world and here here&amp;#39;s your
18:30 body here&amp;#39;s your eye here&amp;#39;s your mouth
18:32 and then inside of there that&amp;#39;s your
18:35 brain not to scale and
18:40 so as you are in the world you have a
18:44 very limited awareness
18:46 of of your given context and the
18:51 everything that that you know comes in
18:54 through your senses and well your senses
18:56 in your memory so let&amp;#39;s think about a
18:58 particular moment in time where you&amp;#39;re
19:00 sitting here you have your eye and then
19:03 you see out
19:08 here there&amp;#39;s a
19:10 cat you like cats and so you so the
19:13 image so light from the sun bounces off
19:16 the cat and goes into your eye and we&amp;#39;ll
19:21 talk a lot about eyes we&amp;#39;ll talk about
19:23 the lens we&amp;#39;ll talk about the retina
19:25 we&amp;#39;ll talk about the phobia we&amp;#39;ll talk
19:28 about the optic nerve um but the most
19:31 the main thing is that
19:34 their your eye is the place where
19:36 environmental energy is first absorbed
19:39 by your nervous system and this
19:43 moment right here is a very special
19:46 moment in your perceptual cycle which is
19:49 the moment of
19:50 transduction um which is the term for
19:53 the moment when some form of
19:56 environmental energy in this case light
19:59 has gets transduced and converted into
20:03 neural activity in this particular case
20:06 in
20:07 your this is your eye the light goes in
20:12 it
20:12 goes into your
20:14 retina into your phobia which talk
20:17 plenty about um there&amp;#39;s a
20:22 particular
20:24 uh class
20:26 of molecule called opsin opsins look
20:30 roughly like this this like you know um
20:34 what are they called carbons and
20:35 hydrogens and then the hexagon and then
20:38 the long the long uh sort of Wiggly tail
20:41 um the people in Biochemistry this is
20:44 probably familiar shapes except this is
20:46 not drawn well and then you have a bunch
20:48 of these opsins in your eye um and
20:52 they&amp;#39;re all there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s basically
20:54 three main ones and they&amp;#39;re sort of
20:55 they&amp;#39;re all they they&amp;#39;re tuned if you
20:58 want to use that term to different
21:00 wavelengths of light and they the nature
21:02 of them is that when a photon of light
21:05 hits them they absorb the energy of that
21:08 Photon and then change shape and I think
21:11 I actually did this backwards I think
21:13 they start out with the Kink and then
21:15 when they absorb the light they
21:16 straighten out um but whatever happens
21:19 this absorption of a photon changes the
21:23 electrochemical properties of the
21:27 molecule and it goes from being a
21:30 neutral to a plus one or a minus one or
21:32 whatever it is um but the point is that
21:35 the the the light that is coming from
21:37 the environment bouncing off the cat
21:40 entering your eye changing the chemical
21:42 layout of the opson um and happening in
21:46 the trillions and billions of sort of
21:48 instances that biology tends to operate
21:50 in um this changes the polarity and the
21:56 Electrical uh state
21:59 of the rods and the cones in your retina
22:02 which get sort of you know accumulated
22:04 with ganglia and various sort of other
22:07 stuff
22:09 um and leads to a shift in the uh
22:13 electrical potential in the in that
22:15 section of your retina that then gets
22:17 sent in as spikes down your optic nerves
22:21 neurons are the things that Neuroscience
22:24 is made of and mostly what neurons do is
22:27 they Spike they send little electrical
22:29 pulses and that&amp;#39;s how they communicate
22:31 that whatever that neuron has tuned to
22:33 has has occurred um and for a for a for
22:38 perception for vision it&amp;#39;s this
22:40 absorption of light into the opson and
22:43 the and the shift in this polarity and
22:46 then the change in that electrical state
22:48 that leads to a change in the
22:53 um what&amp;#39;s the term
22:56 uh the spike rate of of a given gangan
23:00 cell as it is sending its axon down the
23:04 optic nerve into your um
23:09 optic the occipital lobe and the the
23:11 visual cortex
23:14 um and so we&amp;#39;re going to talk more about
23:17 this in more detail and more coherence
23:20 um but the important thing here is that
23:23 the light that has been absorbed by your
23:25 eye that is then gets converted through
23:28 this strange biochemical machine into a
23:32 pattern of neural
23:33 activity uh because the neural activity
23:37 is caused by the light and because the
23:39 light has been reflected off the object
23:41 in question there is a general belief
23:44 and assumption um that that the pattern
23:48 of neural activity has somehow has some
23:52 relationship with the object in the real
23:54 world there&amp;#39;s some statistical
23:56 correlation there&amp;#39;s some relationship
23:58 and the pattern of neural activity
24:00 somehow encodes information about the
24:03 world that you&amp;#39;re looking at um the
24:07 nature of that relationship is tenuous
24:10 and complex um and generally speaking
24:14 extremely impoverished like the actual
24:16 information we&amp;#39;re getting in any mo One
24:17 Moment In Time is far less than you
24:20 think it would be it&amp;#39;s a lot but the
24:23 richness of your visual environment for
24:25 example is very much an illusion based
24:28 off of your brain&amp;#39;s ability to sort of
24:30 Cobble together a lot of noisy
24:32 information to give you something that&amp;#39;s
24:34 sort of accurate enough to move through
24:36 the world but often in almost
24:39 exclusively designed sort of like after
24:41 the fact um
24:49 so that&amp;#39;s your brain again um it&amp;#39;s more
24:52 like a ma brain but that&amp;#39;s fine so your
24:55 optic so the light comes into your eye
24:57 gets absorbed by the retina which is on
24:59 the back of your eye sends a pattern of
25:01 neural activity down your optic nerve um
25:05 passes through some subcortical areas
25:07 and the thalamus and stuff like that
25:09 which we&amp;#39;ll talk not that much about
25:11 that part but there is some stuff that
25:12 happens here um and then projects down
25:16 to the occipital lobe which is otherwise
25:18 known as the visual cortex which is in
25:21 the back of your brain
25:24 um not super important to know where it
25:27 is but it&amp;#39;s just just kind of like one
25:29 of those things like it&amp;#39;s like Vision
25:31 happens here for in the back for
25:35 whatever reason
25:39 um and so this is the place
25:42 where the first kind of like the first
25:46 pass of information about your visual
25:48 environment sort of starts to get
25:50 computed and it&amp;#39;s mostly in the form of
25:52 like edges and dark patches light
25:55 patches you know and stuff like that and
25:59 once you get from V1 which is primary
26:02 visual cortex it goes through other
26:05 stages of processing that lead to sort
26:10 of more and more
26:11 complex you know um structures to emerge
26:15 so like you start with things like edges
26:19 and then if you have enough edges you
26:21 can get patches and if you get patches
26:23 then you can get textures and if you get
26:25 textures you can get objects and
26:29 that sort of like each stage of visual
26:32 processing Builds on the stage before um
26:35 to sort of eventually lead to the
26:37 ability to do things like object
26:39 recognition of like oh that thing out
26:40 there is a cat there&amp;#39;s a there&amp;#39;s a
26:42 conversation we can have about like like
26:45 the the parts of that process that go
26:48 down this lobe which is your temporal
26:50 lobe which is here um tends to be the
26:54 sort of object space of like that&amp;#39;s a
26:56 desk that&amp;#39;s a computer um and then the
27:00 part that we tend to care more about in
27:03 this class is the part that goes up this
27:07 direction um which tends to be more in
27:09 tune of using that information to plan
27:12 your movement out in the world
27:16 um something that I haven&amp;#39;t said I think
27:18 yet but probably but is something that
27:20 bear is repeating is obviously this is a
27:23 cartoon this is a very abstracted
27:27 simplified version of a story which if
27:30 you wanted to tell the whole story you
27:32 would have to tell a thousand thousand
27:34 stories of a thousand thousand humans in
27:36 their Labs recording data getting a
27:38 bunch of numbers and then making up
27:41 their own stories and the discussion
27:42 sections of their own papers about what
27:45 the different parts mean and then this
27:47 kind of cartoonified story is the
27:50 version that tends to make it into the
27:52 textbooks that we T sort of communicate
27:54 back to you and sort of try to make
27:56 sense out of any of it
27:59 but I think it&amp;#39;s really important that
28:01 we remember that this is not the real
28:03 story this is the cartoon and the real
28:06 story is something that we don&amp;#39;t
28:08 actually have access to there is no
28:12 there&amp;#39;s no level like of of class where
28:16 I can just give you the book that says
28:18 here is what the visual cortex is
28:20 actually doing the best I could ever do
28:22 is just to give you a record of all the
28:24 empirical measurements that all the
28:25 humans who have ever investigated this
28:27 man to put together and then tell you
28:29 the story that we have collectively
28:31 decided is the best story that we can
28:34 come up with for how we think this part
28:36 of this lumpy pink thing inside of all
28:39 of our skulls is
28:40 operating
28:43 um but yeah but that&amp;#39;s
28:48 not there is a gap an essential gap
28:51 between epistemology which is our
28:54 knowledge of things and metaphysics
28:57 which is what actually exists uh and the
29:00 two things never truly touch there is
29:03 always going to be a difference between
29:04 knowing something and what that thing
29:07 actually is and in the history of
29:10 science we have told many many many
29:12 stories about what we think is going on
29:15 in the world and in our bodies and in
29:16 our goopy bits um and historically over
29:21 time every single one of those stories
29:23 on a long enough time scale is proven
29:25 wrong in some sense everything we
29:27 currently think think will eventually be
29:29 proven wrong in some way or another um
29:32 evidence for that being everything we&amp;#39;ve
29:34 ever thought up until this point has
29:35 been proven wrong in some way or another
29:38 um so as you think there&amp;#39;s something
29:40 special about today that&amp;#39;s going to keep
29:42 happening um indefinitely until the sun
29:45 burns out but the beauty of the
29:47 scientific process in some sense is that
29:50 we have this belief that even though
29:53 everything has been wrong there is a
29:55 sense that each success of idea is less
29:58 wrong than the one before it and less
30:01 wrong means that it allows us to make
30:03 more precise predictions it allows us to
30:06 heal sickness better it allows us to
30:08 build machines that do more exciting
30:11 things um sometimes those improvements
30:14 happen by completely throwing around
30:16 throwing out philosophical sort of like
30:19 base level beliefs about how certain
30:20 things work um but yeah it&amp;#39;s a
30:24 continuous process we&amp;#39;ll talk about it
30:31 um yes
30:35 so so here we are in this
30:37 cycle you the light has bounced off the
30:40 cat it&amp;#39;s hit your eye it&amp;#39;s been absorbed
30:42 it&amp;#39;s been transmitted back to your
30:45 visual cortex um you have identified
30:49 that it&amp;#39;s a cat and you have a an
30:52 inbuilt volition that says I like to
30:55 touch cats great we support this for you
31:02 so this is the parietal lobe don&amp;#39;t worry
31:04 about the parietal lobe it&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s great
31:07 but you can worry about it if you want
31:10 um but the important sort
31:17 of okay
31:19 so this back here is your visual cortex
31:23 um this on the side here roughly
31:26 speaking is your motor cortex
31:31 and So eventually you start as you as
31:34 you look in more and more pictures of
31:35 the brain you will and you can look at
31:37 this directly the the the wrinkles and
31:39 stuff on the brain are not random they
31:41 are conserved in the same sense that
31:45 while every face that we have looks very
31:48 different they generally have two eyes
31:50 and a nose and a mouth and just in
31:51 different kind of configurations the
31:53 wrinkly stuff and the the crevices and
31:56 bumps and stuff on her brain roughly the
31:58 same like if you were to crack open all
31:59 the brains in this room which I don&amp;#39;t
32:01 recommend um you would find a lot of
32:04 Correspondence in where the the big um
32:07 creases and stuff come in um and I am
32:11 not at the level of that anatomy where I
32:14 can name them off the top of my head um
32:17 but I do recognize them in pictures and
32:19 that&amp;#39;s how you can kind of it&amp;#39;s easy to
32:22 tell when someone is drawing a brain
32:24 artistically versus when they&amp;#39;re looking
32:26 at Anatomy because
32:29 artists and whatnot often just say oh
32:30 yeah it&amp;#39;s a bunch of like pink wrinkles
32:32 and then you just sort of it&amp;#39;s like okay
32:33 well that&amp;#39;s not that&amp;#39;s not actually how
32:35 we do but anyways there&amp;#39;s a big one
32:37 right in the mirror called the central
32:38 sulcus sulcus is like the crease part
32:42 and on this side of that sulcus is the
32:46 somato sensory cortex somat sensation is
32:49 like basically touch like think that
32:52 this type of sensation um and on that
32:55 side is the motor cortex so the n
32:58 sensory cortex and then the motor cortex
33:00 and they tend to be paired
33:03 and you can look up I&amp;#39;ll you we&amp;#39;ll look
33:06 up the huny LI when we talk about the
33:08 motor cortex
33:13 um but I kind of it&amp;#39;s It&amp;#39;s I enjoy this
33:17 distinction and kind of like there&amp;#39;s
33:18 these two sides of the brain where on
33:21 this side of the brain it&amp;#39;s kind of like
33:23 sensation and sort of the the perception
33:26 of the world like visual aspects and
33:28 this the sort of sensory aspects and
33:31 then on this side of the brain is where
33:32 we start getting to like motor actions
33:33 and movements and kind of the outgoing
33:36 parts of things um and as we sort of
33:38 keep going forward you eventually get
33:40 over here to the frontal loes um the
33:43 frontal lobe is like the big lumpy part
33:45 in the front that&amp;#39;s the like the the the
33:47 most human part of the brain all Maman
33:51 brains are roughly the sort of same
33:55 anatomically they&amp;#39;re just very fun
33:58 mirrored into different sort of shapes
33:59 and sizes like you know rats have a much
34:02 more pronounced Factory bulb for smell
34:05 versus their visual cortex and the human
34:08 brain has a has a lot of extra Anatomy
34:13 on that frontal lobe area this is
34:15 thought to be kind of where decision
34:16 making comes from this is where sort of
34:18 like language kind of lives and often in
34:21 it&amp;#39;s um referenced in
34:24 uh like executive function so that the
34:27 feeling of like deciding what you want
34:30 to do this is also where like
34:32 metacognition happens so if you&amp;#39;re
34:33 having thoughts about your thoughts like
34:35 oh yeah I&amp;#39;m angry right now like that&amp;#39;s
34:37 a that&amp;#39;s a frontal loby area and and
34:40 just reiterating the point every time I
34:43 point to a part of the brain and I say
34:45 this is the part that does this thing a
34:47 little part of me inside is screaming
34:51 and dying because none of this is how
34:54 any of it that like that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the
34:56 cartoon that&amp;#39;s not how the real world is
34:58 set up it&amp;#39;s much more complex than that
34:59 it&amp;#39;s much noisier than that but it&amp;#39;s if
35:03 I say this is where executive function
35:05 happens and I point at the front of the
35:07 brain and then this is where Vision
35:08 happens and I point at the back of the
35:09 brain that statement is more true than
35:12 if I switch those two things around so
35:14 just it&amp;#39;s important to reiterate that
35:17 even though I am telling you these
35:18 simplified stories these sort of
35:20 textbook level conversations about how
35:21 the brain
35:23 is this is the stuff that if we come
35:26 back to this class in 250 years we&amp;#39;re
35:28 going to be saying very very different
35:30 things but we&amp;#39;ll probably still say
35:31 something like the vision happens in the
35:33 back and the cognition happens in the
35:35 front anyways um from this frontal lobe
35:39 from the you get sort of the frontal
35:41 area executive functions then you get
35:43 your
35:44 premotor area and somewhere around here
35:47 is where volitions arise volition is
35:52 sort of same route as voluntary it&amp;#39;s
35:55 like the things that you want to do so
35:56 you see you see the the cat and you say
35:58 I want to touch the cat here
36:01 is the cat and look at me I&amp;#39;m touching
36:05 it and that&amp;#39;s this is what I want to
36:08 happen and
36:10 so now you are in this state where
36:13 here&amp;#39;s your body here here&amp;#39;s your hand
36:16 there here&amp;#39;s this cat there and here&amp;#39;s
36:19 this desire that I sure wish that my
36:20 hand part was on this cat part um and
36:24 this sort of and now there&amp;#39;s a a gap
36:27 between
36:28 the way that the world is in your
36:29 perception and the way the world that
36:31 wish the way that you wish the world
36:32 would be which is that your hand was
36:33 sort of touching this object okay so
36:37 those volitions kind
36:38 of meld
36:41 with uh the perceptual
36:45 experience and from this sort of alchemy
36:50 emerges something resembling a motor
36:52 plan
36:54 um we&amp;#39;re going to I&amp;#39;m trying to stop
36:56 myself from going to some of these
36:58 details because I am going to have like
37:00 like we&amp;#39;re going to have a whole lecture
37:01 about the eye we&amp;#39;re going to have a
37:02 whole lecture about the motor cortex
37:03 we&amp;#39;re going to talk about this in more
37:04 detail I&amp;#39;m just giving the overview
37:10 uh but
37:12 um but yeah but this is where we would
37:14 call
37:15 something the first time we start seeing
37:17 something resembling a motor plan
37:19 there&amp;#39;s a lot of times in the chats
37:22 y&amp;#39;all have been having where you talk
37:24 about things like muscle memory um which
37:26 is the sort of muscle memory is kind of
37:29 like the uh it&amp;#39;s a term we like to use
37:32 it&amp;#39;s like a very standard human
37:34 expression um but it&amp;#39;s also one of the
37:36 things that like it doesn&amp;#39;t really exist
37:39 in a physiological sense like your Mo
37:41 your muscles don&amp;#39;t have memory they&amp;#39;re
37:43 much simpler object which we will talk
37:45 about muscles too um usually what you
37:49 mean when you say muscle memory is motor
37:51 plan um and as you sort of work on
37:55 something more and more and you get more
37:56 expertise more experience that&amp;#39;s the
37:59 that that what we tend to refer to as
38:01 motor as muscle memory is really like
38:03 the motor plans kind of becoming more
38:05 robust and more sort of locked in
38:09 um and typically where a lot of that
38:12 kind of motor planning takes place is
38:14 not necessarily in the motor
38:17 cortex um but most of that starts
38:19 happening
38:21 in subcortical regions um so if you
38:25 think about a picture of the brain and
38:26 you think about the that pink wrinkly
38:28 thing in your skull that&amp;#39;s T tends to be
38:31 what we think about that&amp;#39;s your cortex
38:33 that&amp;#39;s the um
38:36 neocortex it&amp;#39;s the part where most of
38:38 the processing happens um which we&amp;#39;ll
38:42 talk a little about what processing
38:43 means in this context um but it is I
38:49 like to I like to talk about this as
38:51 like that is the it&amp;#39;s like that&amp;#39;s kind
38:54 of like the the bloom of the rose on the
38:56 rose bush like when you think about the
38:59 nervous system and you&amp;#39;re looking at
39:02 when you&amp;#39;re looking at a rose bush it
39:04 makes a lot of sense that we tend to
39:05 focus on the rose like the red thing
39:08 with petals and that smells nice and we
39:10 spend a lot of our time focusing on that
39:12 part of the plant in for very good
39:13 reason but if you really take a step
39:15 back and look at it from a b botney
39:17 point of view it&amp;#39;s mostly Bush and just
39:20 a little bit of row and I think that&amp;#39;s
39:24 it&amp;#39;s kind of the same with the way our
39:26 cortex works
39:28 um the majority of our central nervous
39:31 system is not in that cortex it&amp;#39;s in the
39:33 subcortical regions and among my
39:37 favorite of those subcortical regions is
39:39 the cerebellum which it look sort of
39:41 sits at this looks kind of like this
39:43 fist shaped thing that sits right below
39:45 your cortex when you look up pictures of
39:47 the brain online you&amp;#39;ll see the big pink
39:49 wrinkly thing you see this kind of more
39:50 dense sort of like grayish looking thing
39:52 underneath it um that&amp;#39;s your cerebellum
39:56 your cerebellum is a very complicated
39:58 Beast um it contains about 3.5 times as
40:05 many neurons as the rest of your central
40:08 nervous system combined um and that
40:11 number is sort of strangely conserved
40:13 across different animals like all
40:15 animals mammals particular just because
40:17 I don&amp;#39;t know about the other guys um we
40:20 all have cortex we all have cerebellum
40:22 we have very different brain to body
40:24 ratios and different sort of proportions
40:26 there but in General however big your
40:28 brain is whatever animal you are your
40:30 cerebellum is has three and a half times
40:33 as many neurons as the rest of your
40:36 cortex
40:38 um which is one of those things like I I
40:42 always sort of come back to that it&amp;#39;s
40:43 sort of like that just seems anytime you
40:45 find a number in nature that&amp;#39;s conserved
40:47 across a bunch of different stases it&amp;#39;s
40:49 just kind of like that seems like an
40:50 interesting thing I wish I knew more
40:52 about it um so your
40:55 cerebellum the part of the reason why
40:57 has so many more like neurons by by
40:59 count is that the neurons in associated
41:01 with it are teensy teensy tiny they are
41:04 you have granual cells and you have
41:06 pingi cells
41:09 um which I W I&amp;#39;m going to look up
41:12 pictures this because
41:16 ah uh
41:18 Peri
41:21 cells oh do I have internet here
41:31 yeah yeah preni cells in your cerebellum
41:37 are like one of the more beautiful parts
41:42 of the nervous of your of your brain
41:44 it&amp;#39;s kind of you have the cell body you
41:47 have the axon and then these are all the
41:50 synapses and all of there&amp;#39;s thousands
41:53 upon thousands of them um this picture
41:55 is famous this was actually taken by
41:58 not picture but it&amp;#39;s um this is from
42:00 pinji the guy who sort of like he he
42:04 created was it oh sorry kahal uh says
42:07 right there um Ramon kahal
42:11 who yeah um was part of the sort of
42:15 group
42:17 that came up with the staining
42:19 mechanisms that allowed us to sort of
42:20 start looking at neurons in their
42:22 isolation that happened in roughly 1909
42:24 before that we didn&amp;#39;t really know what
42:26 neurons were and didn&amp;#39;t know if they
42:27 were just one big mass or if they were
42:30 individualized pieces and there was like
42:31 a big scientific and philosophical
42:34 debate about are neur is is the brain
42:36 all one big connected piece or did the
42:39 like do the do the neurons touch or are
42:41 they separated from each other and there
42:45 was Ramon Cal who was arguing in the
42:47 favor of the synapse Doctrine which said
42:49 that there was a gap between them and
42:50 then there I think it was GOI who was
42:52 arguing in favor of their it&amp;#39;s all
42:54 touching whatever that was called and
42:57 then um GOI came up with like a silver
43:01 nitrate staining process that allowed
43:04 them to make images like this of looking
43:06 at cells and
43:09 ironically by making that staining
43:11 process prove the Cal side of that
43:15 argument correct and that they tend not
43:17 to touch and then they both got both
43:20 Ramon Cal and GOI got they shared a
43:23 Nobel Prize but apparently they had such
43:26 bad blood between them that they both
43:27 spent their entire speech bashing the
43:29 other guy um so there you go there you
43:32 got that
43:34 um but yeah so
43:38 your so your cerebellum is consists of
43:41 preni cells and then granu
43:46 cells
43:48 which in comparison look more like this
43:53 they&amp;#39;re they&amp;#39;re small and they don&amp;#39;t
43:55 have these super long fibers that sort
43:58 of go very long distances they&amp;#39;re much
44:00 more localized they only connect to
44:02 their immediate neighbors um and the
44:05 majority of ner of of neurons in your
44:08 nervous system are these granular cells
44:10 that live in your cerebellum your
44:13 cerebellum is a layered thing
44:17 um like most parts of your brain it&amp;#39;s
44:20 got kind of like
44:23 um like the layers tend to operate phog
44:27 gentically so that on the outside is the
44:28 newest stuff on the inside is the older
44:31 stuff um sellum has that structure we
44:35 may talk about it I&amp;#39;m not sure uh we&amp;#39;ll
44:37 see it&amp;#39;s one of those things like if
44:38 enough people talk to the bot and ask
44:40 about this then I might like I&amp;#39;ll be
44:42 I&amp;#39;ll be trying to steer the lectures
44:43 based off the interest of the class um
44:47 but anyway we&amp;#39;re talking about cats um
44:50 so light hit the cat hit your eye
44:53 absorbed in your retina tweaked your
44:56 opsins triggered a neural
45:00 Cascade vibrated your visual cortex uh
45:04 gave you the perception of a cat your
45:06 volitional desire to touch the cat
45:09 combined with the knowledge that there&amp;#39;s
45:11 a cat in front of you and started
45:14 creating a motor plan which sort of you
45:16 know this is where the cartoon gets
45:19 really cartoony because it&amp;#39;s
45:21 like there&amp;#39;s a lot of controversy about
45:23 like the different steps of this process
45:25 but long story short something in the
45:28 com combination of your motor cortex and
45:30 your cerebellum which is your cerebellum
45:32 is largely like a motor based thing like
45:34 a movement it mostly deals with movement
45:37 of your body um it&amp;#39;s thought to be
45:39 related to like tool use um so this this
45:43 thing that we humans can do where we
45:45 pick up an object and kind of pretty
45:47 quickly learn the physics of it um and
45:51 using it as a tool that has certain sort
45:53 of characteristics is thought to be like
45:56 a neoc thing the Neo is the new part
45:58 it&amp;#39;s on the outside it&amp;#39;s complicated um
46:03 but there&amp;#39;s a level there&amp;#39;s a
46:05 hierarchical nature of your motor system
46:08 where at the at the higher levels where
46:11 the top is pretty much like the frontal
46:13 lobe the the the plans are much more
46:16 abstract so it&amp;#39;s things like I&amp;#39;m thirsty
46:20 um I want I wish I was drinking water
46:23 right now uh and then in order for that
46:27 high level volition to be turned into
46:28 something that can actually sort of lead
46:31 me to my goal there has to be this sort
46:33 of like um pairing down of specificity
46:37 from that very high level volition uh
46:40 down to something which at some level is
46:42 going to have to boil down to muscle fir
46:45 rings to move my body through space and
46:48 so as I say oh I wish I had water I see
46:50 that there&amp;#39;s water over there and
46:52 somehow that volition is converted into
46:54 motor commands that move my legs so now
46:57 my body is in a place that I can move my
46:58 arm I know how this thing works so I
47:00 open the
47:02 thing and I get to drink water
47:07 um and
47:09 so that process tends to go you know
47:13 from the motor cortex then you got the
47:16 cerebellum then your cerebellum sort of
47:20 has connections to your brain stem I say
47:23 connections but they&amp;#39;re really kind of
47:24 like they&amp;#39;re wrapped around each other
47:26 um
47:27 so you have your brain stem your medulla
47:29 oblongata your ponds um that&amp;#39;s the part
47:33 of your brain people talk about your
47:34 Reptilian Brain that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s that part
47:37 that&amp;#39;s the part that handles things like
47:40 is my heart beating am I breathing is my
47:43 temperature within a livable range that
47:46 tends to be hanging out and controlled
47:48 at your brain stem um and your brain
47:51 stem is the start of
47:53 your spinal cord which is another good
48:00 friend there we go there you
48:05 go there you
48:14 perfect nice still you good job
48:20 um and so your spinal cord is a part of
48:25 your central nervous system often times
48:28 when we think about the spinal cord it&amp;#39;s
48:30 often kind of it&amp;#39;s It&amp;#39;s given a bad W
48:33 and we tend even when we look at
48:34 pictures of like if you Google pictures
48:36 of the central nervous system you&amp;#39;ll
48:37 often see pictures that stop here and
48:39 it&amp;#39;s just sort of like you know cortico
48:42 centrism sort of just focused on that
48:44 that rose on the bush and then less to
48:47 say about you the cerebellum often gets
48:50 in the picture but we often like cut off
48:52 where the spine is um but your spine is
48:55 just as much a part of your nervous
48:57 system as the rest of it and the
48:59 specifically the way that we&amp;#39;re going to
49:00 Define central nervous system as opposed
49:02 to peripheral nervous system is uh
49:06 Loosely that the central nervous system
49:09 is where processing happens um where
49:12 processing is a very goopy term um that
49:16 basically means like information is
49:20 coming in being some sort of conversion
49:23 is happening which we might call a
49:25 computation if we wanted to use like a
49:27 computer analogy
49:30 um but it information comes in changes
49:33 form in some way and then information
49:35 goes out um
49:39 and
49:41 the and you&amp;#39;re and the the spine is
49:45 doing that kind of of processing um at
49:49 various levels which we will also talk
49:50 about let me see how we are on time okay
49:53 on time um
49:56 but it&amp;#39;s in very find it kind of
49:58 fascinating ways and there are some
50:01 stories that we will talk about later in
50:03 the semester of studies that we aren&amp;#39;t
50:07 allowed to do anymore um on cats where
50:10 you can sever the spine like like cut
50:13 the spine so it no longer connects to
50:16 the upper part of the brain um and the
50:19 cat can still do things like walk um
50:22 because the spine is is housing the the
50:25 gray matter that that does that handles
50:28 things like Central pattern generation
50:30 and reflex responses um or something
50:33 like a central pattern generator is a
50:35 thing that handles like the basic
50:37 rhythmic motion of my legs and the thing
50:40 that says oh well one foot is going to
50:42 be in stance and the other one&amp;#39;s going
50:43 to be in swing and then they&amp;#39;re going to
50:44 sort of swap off um and a lot of that
50:47 processing is handled in the spine
50:50 itself
50:52 um your spine goes down your spinal cord
50:57 ends actually around here like right
50:59 below your thoracic spine I know right
51:03 um and then the stuff below that is
51:04 what&amp;#39;s called like the cotus aquinus
51:07 which is like that&amp;#39;s where it does
51:09 become more um extension Cordy like and
51:12 you you start to lose the gray matter
51:14 and you get the more just like the
51:16 peripheral nerves that go out to your
51:19 limbs
51:22 um yeah the yeah so the peripheral so I
51:27 also just want to just again make that
51:28 point that that distinction between
51:30 central nervous system and peripheral
51:32 nervous system is the kind of thing that
51:34 is often stated as like this is a hard
51:36 delineation um but there&amp;#39;s a lot of gray
51:40 area there one of the most classic gray
51:42 areas is the retina um the retina has a
51:46 lot of neurons on the back of it and
51:48 there&amp;#39;s layers to it and it&amp;#39;s often
51:51 described like we think about the retina
51:54 like the eye sort of like the classical
51:56 sensory organ um but there&amp;#39;s stuff
51:59 happening on the back of the retina
52:01 before anything even leaves on on that
52:04 optic nerve pass to the brain that
52:06 really could be considered to be
52:08 computation um similarly your skin has a
52:11 lot of connections in it that you know
52:15 might be doing things that we might
52:16 consider computation um that&amp;#39;s why like
52:19 when you get hurt if you like rub rub
52:21 the thing it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt as much
52:23 because the ACT the activity of
52:25 activating sensory organs around the
52:27 damaged area suppresses the feeling
52:30 coming from the damaged area and that is
52:32 all happening at the level of your skin
52:35 um so just again this this these these
52:38 names and terms and whatnot this is not
52:42 like nature is not
52:44 design divided into pieces with
52:47 departments and names that&amp;#39;s a thing
52:49 that we humans did to Nature so that we
52:52 could have any hope of making any sense
52:53 of it but anytime we put a name or a
52:56 label or or a category into nature we&amp;#39;re
52:59 always going to be making concessions
53:01 and sort of we&amp;#39;re drawing lines around
53:03 areas because it allows us to have
53:05 better conversations about those things
53:07 but there&amp;#39;s always going to be gray
53:08 areas and often times it&amp;#39;s those gray
53:10 areas or the cracks that the that tend
53:12 to lead us to abandon certain thoughts
53:15 and go towards
53:16 others
53:19 um okay so speaking of the peripheral
53:22 nervous
53:24 system um
53:28 so where I wish had colors
53:36 uh there you
53:46 go okay this is your arm that&amp;#39;s these
53:50 are your bones and your
53:52 bones are mostly what you are like if
53:57 we&amp;#39;re thinking about it in terms of like
53:59 the space that you inhabit like the
54:01 shape that you are your general sort of
54:03 ability to move through the world it&amp;#39;s
54:05 mostly bones um and then all the goop
54:08 that&amp;#39;s associated with that is sort of
54:10 the details but the General cookie
54:12 cutter shape of you as a as a creature
54:15 is driven by these weird sticks and
54:17 these weird sticks have weird things
54:20 attached to them called
54:23 muscles um
54:30 and yeah and
54:33 So eventually one of the things that
54:36 happens when you thinking about the sort
54:37 of like more holistic picture of the
54:39 world and sort of
54:42 the way that you live in it
54:45 um
54:47 is be if you&amp;#39;re in a lab if you&amp;#39;re if
54:51 you&amp;#39;re living this reductionist life
54:53 where you&amp;#39;re choosing a particular
54:54 domain of inquiry um and you&amp;#39;re you&amp;#39;re
54:57 sort of simplifying and cutting out any
54:59 extraneous factors that get in your way
55:00 to to sort of zoom in as far as you can
55:02 on that particular thing um you get to
55:06 remove all the parts of the question
55:08 that you don&amp;#39;t want to look at and so if
55:10 you&amp;#39;re a neuroscientist you might have
55:13 you might take the mouse or the rat or
55:15 the fruit fly or whoever you want to
55:16 look at into the lab and then just like
55:19 remove all the parts that you that
55:20 aren&amp;#39;t Neuroscience so that you can have
55:22 a better picture of the neurons that you
55:24 care about when you want to think about
55:27 when you don&amp;#39;t have that capacity and
55:29 you want to think about things more
55:30 generally um you don&amp;#39;t have that um that
55:33 luxury and so if you want to think about
55:36 how humans move through the world um and
55:39 even if you care mostly about the neural
55:42 aspects of it even if you care mostly
55:43 about the perceptual aspects of that you
55:45 are sort of required by the nature of
55:48 reality to consider things like bones
55:51 and muscles even though those are not
55:52 particularly neural objects um because
55:56 when we move when when our all this
55:59 weird neural FL flam is eventually going
56:03 to have to transmit down into something
56:04 that moves the body through the world
56:07 and this is where we get to the kind of
56:08 the robotics y conversation because um
56:13 this is the part where the neural
56:14 activity which has been originally
56:17 transduced into this sensory experience
56:19 of of vision um all of that sort of
56:25 combination of things is eventually
56:27 going to get boiled down here to
56:29 something that sort of flips that coin
56:32 around and now the neural activity is
56:34 going to be converted into environmental
56:36 energy in this case in the form of
56:38 mechanical energy so it&amp;#39;s going to
56:41 squeeze my muscle and my arm is going to
56:42 move that muscle my arm is going to be
56:44 move and this is now has there&amp;#39;s an
56:48 there&amp;#39;s literal like energy in this
56:51 movement specifically in the form of
56:53 kinetic energy or you know you know if
56:57 I&amp;#39;m pulling on a spring or something
56:59 like that might be mechanical energy
57:01 like potential energy kinetic energy
57:02 spring energy that&amp;#39;s the stuff that we
57:04 get from our muscles and so there&amp;#39;s
57:06 that&amp;#39;s the whole perception action cycle
57:08 is this conversion of environmental
57:10 energy into perceptual neural activity
57:14 down back into a motor
57:17 action and so your
57:19 muscles are
57:21 weird objects um and a muscle is
57:25 effectively a variable stiffness spring
57:29 that&amp;#39;s pretty much what a muscle is
57:31 muscles only pull your muscle can only
57:35 pull on things muscles cannot push if
57:38 when I when it looks like I&amp;#39;m pushing
57:40 it&amp;#39;s because this muscle is pulling on
57:42 the tip of that bone so that my arm goes
57:45 that way and that that&amp;#39;s called
57:47 extension and then if I want to squeeze
57:49 this one then I send a motor command
57:52 down there it fires the motor tendon
57:55 Union GGI body
57:58 organs and it says Hey surrounding
58:01 muscle tissue contract and so this what
58:05 was originally a fairly Wiggly Soft
58:07 Spring gets electrified and becomes a
58:10 rather stiff spring and pulls this joint
58:13 up and this one there&amp;#39;s they&amp;#39;re paired
58:17 there&amp;#39;s a
58:18 flexion uh muscle group and then there&amp;#39;s
58:21 the extension muscle group and those two
58:23 things operate in conjunction to to move
58:27 this degree of freedom and that type
58:32 of so yeah and so
58:37 that so the motor plan that comes down
58:41 from the motor cortex and sort of
58:42 through the cerebellum if you&amp;#39;re a fancy
58:45 type of an animal like a human it goes
58:47 through the corticos spinal tract which
58:49 goes there is a sort of connection
58:51 straight from your motor cortex down to
58:53 your spine bypassing things like your
58:55 cerebellum
58:57 all animals have a cortical spinal tract
58:59 but it&amp;#39;s really um but not to equal
59:02 degree um and that&amp;#39;s one of the
59:04 interesting distinctions in the animal
59:05 kingdom is
59:07 like this is a fun this is one of my
59:09 favorite I actually use this question to
59:11 test like AI models to see how it does
59:14 at Neuroscience is asking about the
59:18 cortical spinal tract and how it varies
59:19 across the animal kingdom because that&amp;#39;s
59:21 one of the places where the questions
59:24 get really subtle um and so I can look
59:27 at how it does at that answer to see
59:29 like I&amp;#39;m looking at like a local model I
59:30 can run on my computer like the small
59:33 ones I I can watch it get the subtle
59:35 Parts wrong when I ask it that kind of a
59:37 question so but a lot of stuff I&amp;#39;ve been
59:39 talking about about how like motor
59:41 cortex motor commands go through like
59:43 the cerebellum and the brain stem and
59:44 stuff like that that is true um but
59:47 there is also this cortico spinal tract
59:49 anytime you see one of those big words
59:51 with an o in the middle just replace the
59:53 o with a slash so cortico spinal is C
59:58 cortex SL
60:00 spinal that just basically go straight
60:02 from the cortex down to the spine
60:04 bypassing all the subcortical
60:06 regions um and it&amp;#39;s what allows us to be
60:12 to control our individual degrees of
60:14 freedom of our body directly um as
60:18 opposed to doing things in like it&amp;#39;s
60:20 more synergistic way which
60:22 is way deeper than I want to talk about
60:24 in this particular lecture cheing that
60:26 clock it&amp;#39;s killing me um so yeah so here
60:30 I am I&amp;#39;m so close I&amp;#39;m so ready to almost
60:32 touch this cat um and I my motor my
60:37 motor plan which has come down from on
60:39 high down this sort of hierarchical
60:42 structure of our motor system has uh
60:46 taken my awareness of the world and my
60:50 own body so the vision gives me
60:53 information about remote parts of the
60:55 world things I can not touch things that
60:57 are outside of mine here&amp;#39;s a great word
60:59 peripersonal space the per personal
61:01 space is the area that I can touch with
61:04 my hands um outside of that is a
61:07 different part of the world that&amp;#39;s kind
61:10 of happening in the parietal Lo one of
61:12 my favorite studies is this
61:14 like they got a monkey Myck monkey and
61:18 they trained it to grab things on a desk
61:23 um and then they gave gave it a a
61:27 temporary lesion so they just like
61:28 squirt something into the part of the
61:30 brain that handles that peripersonal
61:31 perception so that that part of the
61:33 brain kind of goes offline um and you
61:36 get what&amp;#39;s called cortical blindness so
61:38 the monkey sort of loses its ability to
61:40 to see things cartoon cartoon um in that
61:43 per personal Zone then they took the
61:46 monkeys and they train it to use a
61:47 grabber arm like a little like like claw
61:51 arm so it now its reach is now farther
61:53 because it can use this arm and when
61:55 they ask after they teach it how to use
61:56 it and they sort of leion that per
61:59 personal Zone the blind spot increases
62:03 to include the region that could be
62:04 reached with the Grabber in addition to
62:07 the hand um
62:10 so put that into your worldview and see
62:13 how it fits
62:15 um so anyways um here I am I see this
62:20 cat and I have this awareness of my body
62:23 a lot of this is sort of call kind of
62:26 associate that with um proprioception um
62:30 so like as my arm is out here it is uh
62:34 putting force on my joints because of
62:37 the weight of the arm and my body can
62:39 encode and is aware of those forces and
62:41 I can use that to kind of be aware of
62:43 where my arm is I can also see my arm I
62:45 also have a memory of lifting it up
62:47 there&amp;#39;s a lot of ways that we know where
62:48 our bodies are um but I know that it&amp;#39;s
62:52 here and that if I can make this part
62:54 move that way um then I&amp;#39;ll have I will
62:57 have achieved
62:59 my my my deepest desire of touching this
63:02 cat
63:03 um and so there&amp;#39;s there&amp;#39;s a lot of comp
63:06 complicated stuff about the like we
63:08 don&amp;#39;t move our body one joint at a time
63:10 we move it in the sort of like barely
63:15 sophisticated dance um and a lot of that
63:18 the breakdown and how we sort of how we
63:20 choose to to to break down a complex
63:23 movement across the available joints in
63:25 the context of the world that&amp;#39;s a a
63:27 cerebellum thing again cartoons um but
63:32 let&amp;#39;s pretend like it&amp;#39;s not and so I I
63:35 relax what is it so I I relax the flexor
63:41 I
63:41 tighten the extensor and that puts a
63:46 torque on this bone which moves my hand
63:50 here and now I
63:52 have the reward of cat
63:57 Sensations under my hand and I have now
64:00 achieved this this goal of
64:03 mine
64:06 um right and so now and now we have and
64:09 that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s the loop so that&amp;#39;s one
64:12 path through that perception action Loop
64:14 because now that the information has
64:16 gone in been processed been sort of
64:19 whatever and now that I have moved my
64:21 body I have now changed the state of the
64:23 world like my body is in the world so
64:25 now as I&amp;#39;m perceiving the situation as
64:27 it stands I&amp;#39;m perceiving something
64:29 different and now I&amp;#39;m going to go back
64:30 through that Loop and so of you know you
64:32 perceive you act and then you take in
64:35 the information and you kind of like
64:37 that Loop is tends to be where you live
64:39 your whole life
64:42 um and
64:43 so yeah and so this is kind of the
64:46 cartoon overview of of the story as it
64:49 as it holds um I will name some of the
64:53 uh the fields associated with the things
64:55 that we talked about
65:00 um yeah uh generally speaking when we
65:04 talk
65:05 about well talking about like the
65:07 physiology of the eyeball tends to be
65:09 kind of like optology I guess um uh but
65:13 that&amp;#39;s that&amp;#39;s more like lens and pupil
65:15 and like the the goopy Parts um once
65:18 you&amp;#39;re talking about like the the neural
65:21 the neural activity aspect of it we tend
65:23 to call that like visual like visual
65:26 Neuroscience perceptual
65:28 Neuroscience because we are such Vision
65:30 heavy animals as humans often when you
65:33 hear perceptual we tend to mean visual
65:37 um but strictly speaking it&amp;#39;s all like
65:40 anything sensory is perceptual um when
65:43 we start talking about the parts of the
65:45 Neuroscience that are moving your body
65:47 we tend to call that motor Neuroscience
65:50 you will often hear people talk about
65:51 perceptual motor Neuroscience which
65:53 again perceptual motor is the same
65:55 perceptual SL motor and it&amp;#39;s kind of
65:58 like it&amp;#39;s this connection and this kind
65:59 of like this reality that the two parts
66:02 are um perception in action and
66:04 perception in motor control they&amp;#39;re sort
66:06 of intimately
66:08 linked um oh I should mention this too
66:11 um in your peripheral nervous system you
66:16 have peripheral
66:18 neurons and your peripheral neurons come
66:20 in two types there is perceptual and
66:23 there&amp;#39;s motor shockingly
66:27 and that distinction is is defined by
66:30 basically which direction the
66:32 information is Flowing so a motor
66:34 command goes out from your central
66:38 nervous system towards your periphery
66:40 carrying a motor command so this this is
66:43 a a neuron that&amp;#39;s connected to a you
66:46 know motor unit in my muscle and if it
66:49 gets sort of tapped by one of these
66:51 higher level structures it&amp;#39;s going to
66:54 get spikes
66:56 that are telling it to Fire and that
66:58 will contract the muscle um once I touch
67:03 the cat what was the object of my plans
67:08 um there are the the
67:12 the the the the neurons connected to
67:14 like the sensory um organs in my hand
67:19 start firing differently and they send
67:21 information back down your sensory
67:24 peripheral nerves peripheral sensory
67:26 nerves yeah
67:28 so in your periphery it is just it&amp;#39;s out
67:31 outward stuff is your motor neurons um
67:35 inward stuff is your Sensory neurons and
67:36 that&amp;#39;s kind of the main distinction
67:38 there um again uh just the word cartoons
67:42 going on there yeah why are you
67:46 aware what&amp;#39;s that why you not like
67:51 aware why are you not
67:53 aware yeah
67:56 this is one of I think the
67:58 most troubling realities of being alive
68:04 is that and this is also part of the the
68:07 standard um existential crisis that
68:10 classes like this tends to give to
68:11 people so have fun with that um we have
68:16 a very very thin awareness of what is
68:21 going on under the hood in our bodies
68:24 and we have
68:26 we have some awareness we have some
68:28 conscious experience of like I&amp;#39;m going
68:29 to reach out and grab this thing I&amp;#39;m
68:30 going to oh yeah this feels cool in my
68:33 hand this feels hard in my hand um
68:37 but the more you learn about
68:39 neuroscience and the more you learn
68:41 about what&amp;#39;s going on in the Hood the
68:42 more you realize that those sensory that
68:44 like the cognitive like the the
68:46 conscious personal experience of having
68:49 a motor experience um is a really really
68:53 thin layer on top of a lot of complexity
68:55 that&amp;#39;s going on and that is
68:58 unfortunately just like the situation
69:01 that we are in um remember one time I
69:04 was in grad
69:05 school and we were in like a a parking
69:08 lot my friends and winter waiting to go
69:10 on a hike or something like that and for
69:13 some reason this really stuck with me
69:14 but there was just like a puddle of like
69:17 dirty water in the middle of the parking
69:20 lot that had this like really beautiful
69:23 like oil sheen on top of it and it was
69:26 just like the sort of fractal iridescent
69:29 colors just and by the nature of oil
69:33 it&amp;#39;s just like one molecule thick that
69:35 is giving this really beautiful like
69:38 vibrant colorful shape on top of just
69:43 cold dark murky water and I think about
69:46 that a lot when I think about the
69:48 nervous system because it just feels
69:50 like that is kind of our experience of
69:52 living in a body is we have this
69:55 experience that is sort of riding on top
69:58 of this really deep and
70:00 complex biological neural complex system
70:06 and the that conscious Sheen is related
70:11 to the depths of what&amp;#39;s going on there
70:13 but we don&amp;#39;t really tend to have access
70:15 to it like I can&amp;#39;t feel my stomach
70:18 deciding when it wants to squirt out
70:20 more enzymes to digest my food and I
70:23 can&amp;#39;t tell the difference between
70:26 you know parts of this thing happening
70:29 and you know like it&amp;#39;s just it&amp;#39;s not
70:31 really available to me there are once
70:34 you start learning about the about the
70:36 bits and pieces you can start kind of
70:39 mapping on your your conscious
70:41 experiences to the things that I&amp;#39;m going
70:43 to be telling you is maybe happening
70:44 under the hood um one of the ones that&amp;#39;s
70:47 coming to me right now for whatever
70:49 reason is like it&amp;#39;s kind of a thing that
70:51 is known where when when when a person
70:53 starts lifting weights for the first
70:54 time if you&amp;#39;ve never been a
70:56 weightlifting person there&amp;#39;s a a thing
70:58 that happens where you very quickly like
71:01 you&amp;#39;ll shoot up the amount of weight
71:03 that you can lift in a very short amount
71:04 of time because your body is learning
71:08 how to fire all of your motor units at
71:10 once and that&amp;#39;s just the thing that in
71:12 your general life you just tend not to
71:13 do and you kind of have to learn how to
71:15 do that like how to extend like maximal
71:17 effort
71:19 and that is something that&amp;#39;s happening
71:21 at the level of like recruitment of
71:23 motor units and so if you then if you
71:26 now go to the gym and you start having
71:27 that experience you sort of feel oh yeah
71:29 I&amp;#39;m getting super strong and it&amp;#39;s just
71:30 kind of like you can map that experience
71:32 onto this thing I just said about how
71:34 your motor units work but it&amp;#39;s in but
71:36 that mapping is in the this like weird
71:38 cognitive space like it&amp;#39;s not at that
71:40 level of like deep awareness but then
71:43 you have to ask like what what would
71:45 that even look like if it was yeah so
71:47 over time when you&amp;#39;re like lifting
71:49 weight why do you hit
71:51 a because eventually you you&amp;#39;re
71:53 recruiting all of your motor units and
71:55 then you just don&amp;#39;t have enough muscle
71:57 to produce the force so that&amp;#39;s the that
71:59 beginner spike in performance is you&amp;#39;re
72:02 not actually growing muscle mass in that
72:04 period of time you&amp;#39;re just learning how
72:06 to actually like use all the muscles
72:08 that you have and then you hit that
72:09 plateau and it&amp;#39;s like okay well now I&amp;#39;m
72:11 using I&amp;#39;m firing 100% of my muscle
72:14 abilities just my muscles aren&amp;#39;t strong
72:16 enough to actually move my body so and a
72:18 lot of those sort of plateaus in
72:20 performance can be sort of tied back to
72:23 sort of physiological structures that
72:24 change and like the time courses of of
72:27 improvement happen that you know like
72:29 growing more muscle takes time whereas
72:31 learning how to fire motor units also
72:34 takes time but not in the same way
72:37 so a lot of dep there
72:42 um that area that I was just so speaking
72:44 of
72:45 naming I never I&amp;#39;ve never been able to
72:48 finish a leure before the end of class
72:53 um that thing were just that little area
72:56 is kind of often in the area we would
72:58 call neuromechanics neuromechanics is a
73:02 relatively new newly named field I would
73:06 be curious to see if it&amp;#39;s in that
73:08 mesh uh terminology thing we learned
73:10 about last time um but neuromechanics
73:14 neural mechanics um is kind of like at
73:17 that boundary of neural activity and
73:21 like and like physics like mechanics um
73:25 stuff uh so that thing of like firing a
73:28 motor unit to create a spring force that
73:30 moves the limb that&amp;#39;s a neuromechanical
73:33 question um and then like how that
73:34 connects to like the spinal Central
73:36 pattern generators you know that&amp;#39;s where
73:38 it starts to get like is that still
73:40 neuromechanics is that you know these
73:41 are murky areas um on the other side of
73:46 neuromechanics you have biomechanics
73:48 biomechanics is
73:49 literally Newton&amp;#39;s Laws as it applies to
73:54 meat
73:55 um and we will be talking about that
73:59 uh to some level of specificity um the
74:04 not too distant future
74:06 um let&amp;#39;s
74:11 see yeah let me let me finish this up
74:14 and we&amp;#39;ll talk about
74:16 that um yeah so biome mechanics is
74:19 related to like just the physics of
74:21 moving your body um we&amp;#39;re particularly
74:23 going to talk about
74:25 descriptions of the body that are that
74:27 basically remove any conception of
74:31 biology from them and just thinking
74:32 about the human as an object that weighs
74:36 a lot and is balanced on a pretty narrow
74:40 uh platform and that&amp;#39;s sort of center of
74:44 mass base of support level of uh
74:47 description of the human body which we
74:48 will talk about in some detail pretty
74:51 soon um another thing I haven&amp;#39;t
74:54 mentioned but we will talk about to is
74:55 evolution because all of these systems
74:58 are evolved systems they all they
75:00 developed over billions of years um to
75:06 the form that they currently are and in
75:08 the same sense of things you can
75:10 describe the system as it stands right
75:12 now but you&amp;#39;re always going to be
75:14 missing some of the story if you don&amp;#39;t
75:15 think about it in the context of how it
75:17 emerged um and so I haven&amp;#39;t quite
75:20 figured
75:22 out a lot of the things I&amp;#39;m talking
75:24 about are the things that are going to
75:25 go into these sort of numbered lectures
75:28 once I sort of figure out how I want to
75:30 chop things up um there&amp;#39;s I&amp;#39;m going to
75:33 be extracting a lot of things from what
75:35 your conversations are to figure out how
75:37 to steer that those lectures um there&amp;#39;s
75:40 some hit points that I&amp;#39;m going to hit no
75:42 matter what you guys want to do um and
75:44 evolution is going to be one of those
75:46 things and
75:47 specifically for us
75:49 um it&amp;#39;s going to I&amp;#39;m going to be well I
75:52 guess talk a little about the evolution
75:53 of your eye but um I think a lot of my
75:56 particular interest is in the thing that
75:59 is often yeah evolution of your your
76:02 skeleton um like why our skeletons are
76:05 the particular weird shape that they are
76:07 how we sort of developed from our
76:10 Origins as fish that turn into lizards
76:13 that turn
76:15 into squirrels that turn into monkeys
76:17 that turn into Apes that turn into us um
76:21 because it matters a lot um
76:26 evolution of our eye is another odd
76:29 story
76:31 uh the our retina is backwards in some
76:34 pretty interesting ways like it&amp;#39;s not
76:37 it&amp;#39;s like flipped in the direction that
76:39 you would expect it to be like you would
76:41 expect that the light sensing aspects of
76:43 it will be facing towards the light but
76:46 they&amp;#39;re actually backwards they face
76:48 back and they kind of have to bounce
76:50 through and this is thought to be
76:51 related to like when we crawled out of
76:53 the ocean and our eyes kind of inverted
76:56 to
76:56 allow the same kind of refraction to
76:59 happen
77:03 um yeah so uh we didn&amp;#39;t talk in this
77:06 particular story about eye movements eye
77:08 movements we will talk about also in
77:10 some detail um I we have we humans have
77:14 very mobile eyes that&amp;#39;s a very
77:16 Cornerstone aspect of our visual system
77:18 is that our eyes move a lot um it is
77:22 part of the motor system to be able to
77:25 move any part of your body including the
77:26 eyes and that specific area is called
77:29 ocul motor control oculo eye motor
77:33 movement oculo motor is sort of stuff
77:36 related to eye movements um and so
77:40 things like ocul motor control is
77:42 obviously very overlapping with things
77:43 like visual perception and perceptual
77:45 Neuroscience because as we move our eyes
77:48 the information on the retina changes
77:51 and we have to make and we make
77:52 decisions about where to move our eyes
77:55 in the same way we make decisions about
77:56 where to move our our arms but this is
77:59 also a place that
78:01 like as like we you can live a whole
78:04 happy life and like never really think
78:07 about your eye movements but once you
78:09 start thinking about your eye movements
78:10 you&amp;#39;ll realize that it&amp;#39;s I think about
78:13 it a lot like it&amp;#39;s it feels a lot like
78:15 breathing to me where usually your
78:19 breathing is something that just happens
78:21 on its own but you can control it to
78:24 some EXT like I can hold my breath I can
78:26 take a breath I can do that I have
78:28 volitional control over my breathing in
78:31 a way that I don&amp;#39;t over my heart um and
78:35 our eye movements are kind of like that
78:36 as well like I can choose to look one
78:38 place or another um I can choose not to
78:40 look at something um but for the most
78:44 part for
78:45 99.9% of my Waking Life my eyes are just
78:48 kind of doing what they do um and being
78:51 driven by a combination of a ailable
78:55 visual information and my desires of the
78:59 world and sometimes like if I throw
79:01 something in the air I will look at it
79:03 and then catch it and there&amp;#39;s a lot of
79:06 that process that is happening just
79:09 below that level of conscious awareness
79:12 um and that I think is a nice enough
79:14 segue into we&amp;#39;re going to talk about for
79:17 the last 10 minutes which is methods
79:21 methodologies um methods is kind of a
79:24 it&amp;#39;s just just the term that we use
79:26 for like how in God&amp;#39;s name are you going
79:29 to study any of this that&amp;#39;s kind of what
79:30 methods means
79:33 and generally speaking when we talk
79:35 about methods we&amp;#39;re talking about
79:38 um equipment and and ways that we can do
79:41 empirical measurements of the world that
79:43 will give us information about parts of
79:47 the world that we think might we might
79:48 be able to glean some insight into these
79:51 deeper weirder aspects of the this is
79:55 another great term desiderata of our
79:58 investigation desiderata means that
80:01 which is desired um and it is a sort of
80:04 philosophy of science term
80:06 about what are you trying to figure out
80:09 you came into this room as a scientist
80:11 because you have a certain there&amp;#39;s
80:13 something you want to know more about
80:14 there&amp;#39;s some part of the world that you
80:16 want to gain insight into what is that
80:20 thing and how how can you do it given
80:23 all the limitations and straints and
80:25 sort of difficulties of like how the
80:28 world is um for me in for me in my sort
80:32 of domain of inquiry um I I use two
80:37 primary uh research tools map which is
80:40 sort for motion capture um which is the
80:43 thing if you see like behind the scenes
80:46 stuff in movies and video games like the
80:47 suit with the dots and stuff like that
80:50 that&amp;#39;s motion capture and that&amp;#39;s
80:51 basically related to um moving the body
80:55 like sort of recording the movement of
80:57 the body um in space and I will
81:00 be at one of the lab sections I will be
81:03 showing um I&amp;#39;ll be bringing in some
81:05 cameras and doing a freeo cap recording
81:08 which is the open source software that
81:09 I&amp;#39;ve been building um which is designed
81:11 to like help um record the body with a
81:14 high degree of fidelity um like this
81:17 specific three-dimensional configuration
81:19 of the body at any given moment in time
81:21 because you know I would love to be able
81:23 to study all the Bing activity of the
81:25 pingi cells and the cerebellum but
81:27 that&amp;#39;s not available to me in this year
81:29 of Our Lord
81:30 2025 um I can&amp;#39;t actually get that
81:33 measurement and the methods that I could
81:34 use even if we if we if we could get
81:36 that from something like fmri which is
81:38 like the tube that you get the sort of
81:40 colorful pictures of the brain um in
81:43 this current moment in technology I
81:46 can&amp;#39;t use that type of a tool and also
81:49 have a person out in the world throwing
81:51 and catching and doing stuff like that
81:54 um
81:55 and so we use motion capture as a
81:58 methodology to record the 3D
82:01 configuration of the body over time then
82:04 we use those movements to try to infer
82:07 while if the if the arm did this and
82:10 gravity is like that then the muscles
82:13 must have done this or that in order to
82:16 produce the forces that generated that
82:17 movement and then you kind of backtrack
82:19 from well if the mo if the muscles did
82:21 this then the spine must have done that
82:23 and sort of you can use this kind of
82:25 like this observable aspect of reality
82:28 which is like the location of the arm
82:31 measure it to the level of fidelity that
82:33 you can with the available technology
82:34 that you have and then use those
82:37 empirical measurements to try to infer
82:39 all this weird goopy nonsense of what
82:41 I&amp;#39;ve been talking about about this part
82:43 of the brain that part of the brain that
82:44 part of the brain um the other
82:46 technology that I tend to use a lot is I
82:49 can draw on this board ey tracking which
82:52 everybody loves eye tracking um it&amp;#39;s
82:54 always a crowd favorite um but that&amp;#39;s
82:59 another sort of
83:00 like there&amp;#39;s different tools to use it
83:03 but mostly these days we use video-
83:05 based eye trackers which is literally
83:06 just little cameras pointed at the eye
83:10 and it&amp;#39;s kind of a a convenient thing
83:14 that we are as humans um have these
83:17 highly mobile eyes um that sort of wind
83:21 up giving this really interesting
83:23 readout of what my brain wanted to get
83:27 more information about at each moment in
83:29 time so if you give me a task like
83:32 walking over rough terrain or sort of
83:34 juggling or throwing and catching or
83:36 something like that um you can look at
83:39 the movement of my eye and at the very
83:42 least know the visual information that
83:45 was available to me in that moment by
83:47 doing sort of 3D modeling and sort of
83:49 saying okay the eye moved this way and
83:51 then this the object was over here and
83:53 so you know
83:54 you know based on what I know about the
83:56 eye I couldn&amp;#39;t see it then or I could
83:58 see it in my
84:00 periphery um and then I chose to make a
84:02 movement that would align my eye so now
84:04 it&amp;#39;s in my phobia and so you can use
84:08 just like a camera pointed at the eye to
84:10 tell the information that was being
84:13 transmitted into my visual cortex and
84:15 sort of going down that way which both
84:17 gives you the information that I had
84:20 available and more importantly arguably
84:23 the place that my eyes move to tells me
84:26 the place that my central nervous system
84:28 decided I want more information from
84:30 this part of the world and because those
84:33 eye movements tend to happen really
84:35 really fast like you know 150
84:36 milliseconds per eye movement if you&amp;#39;re
84:38 doing a difficult task um like well
84:42 below the level of conscious awareness
84:43 we can tell stories about what we were
84:45 doing after the fact but in the moment
84:47 the eyes just kind of go where they need
84:49 to go um and so I can tell both what
84:53 information was available to this weird
84:55 magical meat robot at any moment in time
84:57 and I can also look at the decisions
85:00 that were made of oh I&amp;#39;m going to move
85:01 my eyes this way and not that way until
85:05 where my central nervous system desired
85:08 more information from in the world at
85:11 any moment in time and so in the by the
85:13 combination of these things of being
85:15 able to measure the sort of the
85:17 perceptual input in the form of eye
85:19 tracking and the motor output in the
85:21 form of motion capture um
85:26 Wei this is my general attempt is to my
85:30 my general approach to scientific
85:32 research is to try to combine these two
85:34 methodologies to give a sense of like
85:36 get a picture of what&amp;#39;s h of what a
85:38 given of a what a human is doing in the
85:40 world as they sort of perform complex
85:42 actions and then use that weird pile of
85:46 data that pours out of those machines to
85:48 give some insight into this stuff often
85:51 in my particular case
85:54 in the sort of conversation of science
85:57 um I I this domain this typ type of
86:00 research tends to give ecologically
86:03 valid like like realist like it&amp;#39;s real
86:05 data of real people doing real stuff but
86:07 the Fidelity is just limited like
86:09 there&amp;#39;s only the the accuracy and
86:11 precision of information that I can
86:13 provide with these methods is just very
86:14 very limited relative to someone who&amp;#39;s
86:16 in a lab pulling out individual neurons
86:19 and sort of doing all the reductionist
86:21 work that they can do to get really
86:22 precise numbers so the so the the
86:25 sociology of Sciences people like me
86:28 doing the broad scoke type of research
86:31 work with people who to the more careful
86:33 reduction of stuff and ideally we kind
