We're recording now. To repeat that, the proper assignment, like the proper poster proposal assignment, will be a one or two sentence write-up on the topic area that you want your poster to be on, along with a singular citation of a paper that represents the research in the area you will be presenting on. 

The standard assignment for 22.99 is that you are supposed to pick a singular paper for the whole semester, and then your poster will be you presenting just that paper. I think we can go a little bit beyond that. If that's all you want to do, that's totally valid, but I think we can do a broader overview. To keep us honest, I'm going to ask you to pick a singular paper, and the bot-mediated conversation will be designed to help you do that. 

So if you give it, say, "Here's the topic I want to study, here's a paper I'm thinking about, here's the abstract," I'll prompt the bot to ask you the kinds of questions I would ask you if I had the time and energy to sit down and talk about it. Behind the curtain, when they talk about this class, most of what they tell us to do is to help you not pick a review article for your paper, but to pick an actual empirical research article. 

If you just search for papers on a given topic, you're going to find review articles at the top of that list, and it's not always super obvious whether you're looking at a review article, a book chapter, or an empirical study. I can tell the bot to help you with that, and it will do things like ask you about the methodologies and topics, helping you parse the very dense language that abstracts or scientific papers are typically written in. 

There will be some sort of simple checkbox-style Canvas assignment and a Discord server-based conversation space. Those will be due next week, meaning 11:59 p.m. on Sunday before the following Monday. If you don't hit that deadline, there will be dire consequences—not really, but we want to keep in that general cadence so that we're all on the same path. 

By the end of next week, I will have implemented the stuff where the bot will be keeping track of a profile of your interests and trying to help you on your journey through this general field. But we'll see. Anytime I make a promise about the future, just know internally I am screaming. 

Great, okay, let's go ahead and get into it. I know what to do—methods. I realized I forgot motion capture tracking, etc. I also forgot a piece of equipment that I intended to bring today, so I will use this instead. Someone doesn’t know how to—great, that works. 

Alrighty, okay, so let us begin the lecture proper. It's been nice for the first part of this class seeing you guys talking about your interests in the server, talking to the bot about what you're into and what you want to study. I intentionally wanted to have that part happen first before I talked too much about my own particular map of this space because I wanted to let you guys think about it for yourselves before I came up and did the traditional professor thing, which is to tell you, "Here's what this field is, here's what this means, here's what is on topic, here's what is off topic." 

I generally don't think that that's how we should think about intellectual inquiry. In the next chunk of time, I'm going to give you an overview of this domain of human-centered neuroscience that is mostly related to my own particular history, my own research background, and the studies that I've done. By the time you have lived long enough to have specialties and personal experiences, you will have charted your own path and trajectory into the heart of some field or domain. 

For pretty much all of you, for everyone that chooses to follow a route like that, you are going to have a unique path. Everybody's path is going to be different, and the topics that are relevant to everyone's interests will all be different. I don't want to present this stuff in the sense of saying, "Here is everything that matters, here is everything that is relevant to this topic." I really want to keep it on a relatively personalized narrative of these are the topics that are the most important for me to study human perceptual-motor neuroscience in the ways that I specifically have learned how to do. 

The beauty of using AI-mediated tools in a classroom setting is that in a traditional class, the professor lays out the curriculum, the structure, and the topic area, and then you are all constrained to follow that structure. That's largely for practical reasons; it's just too hard and requires too much human labor to mediate and navigate the particular variations of interest of people in a room, even a room labeled under a particular course title. 

But I think with AI, limited though it may be, it will always do its best to make whatever your interests are relevant to the topics that I have mandated it should care about. As I start going through this stuff, I encourage you to really key into your own personal feelings of interest, being drawn to or moved by some topic or domain. If you want to follow the trajectories that I'm doing, that's all well and good, but even if you wanted to, it wouldn't happen that way because that's not how the world works. 

As I give this lecture, my main request for you is to not let your brain turn all the way off. I'm going to be talking fast about a lot of topics that may be relatively unfamiliar. For some of them, it might be the first time you've heard about it; for others, you might have heard about it before. The goal is not to have you understand everything I'm saying; the goal is to expose you to it. 

So as I start sort of blah blah blahing at you, don't get too hung up on whether or not you're following everything. Just try to remember the words as much as you can and let it wash over you. I promise you some of it will stick. When we open things back up, you can start asking the bot or your neighbors questions about the parts that were most interesting to you. 

The part that I have found most gratifying about doing this type of class is the discovery that every time empirically, when I give a lecture on a given topic and then say to 40 students, "Ask the bot about the parts you found most interesting," typically what I see from that is 40 different conversations about 40 different topics, and that's really a lot of fun. 

With that said, let us get into it. Unfortunately, I intended to bring a tablet so I could draw stuff with colors, and I brought the tablet, but when I looked for the pen part, I found I just threw a standard pencil into here, which I can't even imagine what was going on when I did that. So we're just going to do it old school with just a singular color, but that's okay. 

So the topic of the course is neuroscience. The department is biology, and most of you, as biology majors, have internalized to some degree or another, with validity, that biology and neuroscience are related to things like cells, neurons, and wet lab microscope types of conversations. Super valid, super good topics, good things to look at, and all part and parcel with a particular philosophical tradition that is fundamental to the way we do scientific research in 2025 on Earth, which we often don't even think about. 

That is the concept of reductionism. Reductionism is a general philosophical approach to the study of the natural world, which tries to break things down into smaller and smaller pieces so that you can make more precise measurements and investigations. This approach has the implicit assumption that by looking at the component pieces of the world, you'll be able to get a sense of how everything works. 

There is a lot of validity to that approach, but there are also limitations. If you're only looking at the small pieces in isolation, you're going to have a hard time seeing what we call emergent properties—things that only come about when you look at the combination of things at a larger scale than what you can put into a test tube and under a microscope. 

The classic example of emergence is traffic. Traffic is a property of cars on a road, but you can never understand traffic by looking at a singular car. It's something that only comes about when you're looking at the cars operating in their natural environment. The counter to reductionism is what you might call holism, but that tends to be the scale that my research domain operates in. 

I tend not to look at the research of people doing highly reduced electrophysiology studies where they put electrodes into the brains of various animals, or fMRI studies where they have people in a tube looking at the magnetic resonance of their hemoglobin in their brain. My particular domain of research tends to focus on humans behaving in natural environments, doing the kinds of things we do in our day-to-day lives. 

For example, throwing things in the air and catching them involves a motor behavior of putting force into the marker, an information-gathering phase, and then another motor command. If it lines up with the world, it works out; if it doesn't, I drop it. I'm trying to understand that behavioral process in its natural context and use the best measurements I can come up with of those behaviors, then trying to attach them to the more low-level reductionist fields of inquiry. 

I think of it as almost a robotics approach. I like to tell people that I study the part of neuroscience that overlaps with robotics because robotics is another field that keeps you honest in the sense that you make things that move around in the real world. You can't really cut corners; the thing just stops working. 

The difference is that with robots, we know how they work because we made them, but they can't do all the things we want. Humans, on the other hand, we don't really know how they work, but they can do pretty much anything. There's this combination of thinking about the human as a magical meat robot and trying to study it from that perspective, which can lead to a lot of useful results. 

The nice thing about that is the abstraction away from the biology and the knowledge that it is, in fact, under the hood, cells and neurons and membrane potentials, and thinking about it more in terms of the things we can measure, which we will talk about shortly. 

Speaking of the natural world, let's talk about something that is one of the ways to parse out that general topic, which is called the perception-action cycle. Let's start by drawing a brain. I'm trying to draw it. Yes, let's do it like that. 

So here's how you draw a brain. There you go. Sorry, try and you'll figure it out. Okay, so this is your brain. This is a picture of your brain. That's your temporal lobe; this is your eye; you're facing that way. There are a lot of details that are not being covered here, but this is the general shape. 

So here you are; that's you, and your existence in the world. Let's see, let's do this a different way. There you go; that's you. You're in the world, and here's your body. Here's your eye; here's your mouth, and then inside of there, that's your brain—not to scale. 

As you are in the world, you have a very limited awareness of your given context, and everything that you know comes in through your senses and your memory. Let's think about a particular moment in time where you're sitting here, you have your eye, and then you see out here there's a cat. You like cats. 

So the image—light from the sun bounces off the cat and goes into your eye. We'll talk a lot about eyes; we'll talk about the lens, we'll talk about the retina, we'll talk about the fovea, we'll talk about the optic nerve. The main thing is that your eye is the place where environmental energy is first absorbed by your nervous system. 

This moment right here is a very special moment in your perceptual cycle, which is the moment of transduction. This is the term for the moment when some form of environmental energy—in this case, light—gets transduced and converted into neural activity. In this particular case, in your eye, the light goes in, it goes into your retina, into your fovea, which we'll talk plenty about. 

There's a particular class of molecules called opsins. Opsins look roughly like this—what are they called? Carbons and hydrogens, and then the hexagon, and then the long wiggly tail. People in biochemistry are probably familiar with these shapes, except this is not drawn well. 

You have a bunch of these opsins in your eye, and there are basically three main ones. They are tuned, if you want to use that term, to different wavelengths of light. The nature of them is that when a photon of light hits them, they absorb the energy of that photon and then change shape. 

I think I actually did this backwards; I think they start out with a kink, and then when they absorb the light, they straighten out. Whatever happens, this absorption of a photon changes the electrochemical properties of the molecule, and it goes from being neutral to a plus one or a minus one or whatever it is. 

The point is that the light coming from the environment, bouncing off the cat, entering your eye, changing the chemical layout of the opsin, and happening in the trillions and billions of instances that biology tends to operate in, changes the polarity and the electrical state of the rods and cones in your retina. 

These get accumulated with ganglia and various other stuff, leading to a shift in the electrical potential in that section of your retina that then gets sent in as spikes down your optic nerve. Neurons are the things that neuroscience is made of, and mostly what neurons do is they spike; they send little electrical pulses, and that's how they communicate that whatever that neuron has tuned to has occurred. 

For perception, for vision, it's this absorption of light into the opsin and the shift in this polarity, and then the change in that electrical state that leads to a change in the spike rate of a given ganglion cell as it sends its axon down the optic nerve into your occipital lobe and the visual cortex. 

We're going to talk more about this in more detail and more coherently, but the important thing here is that the light that has been absorbed by your eye gets converted through this strange biochemical machine into a pattern of neural activity. Because the neural activity is caused by the light, and because the light has been reflected off the object in question, there is a general belief and assumption that the pattern of neural activity has some relationship with the object in the real world. 

There's some statistical correlation; there's some relationship, and the pattern of neural activity somehow encodes information about the world that you're looking at. The nature of that relationship is tenuous and complex, and generally speaking, extremely impoverished. The actual information we get in any one moment in time is far less than you think it would be. 

The richness of your visual environment, for example, is very much an illusion based on your brain's ability to cobble together a lot of noisy information to give you something that's sort of accurate enough to move through the world, but often almost exclusively designed after the fact. 

So that's your brain again. It's more like a brain, but that's fine. Your optic nerve—the light comes into your eye, gets absorbed by the retina, which is on the back of your eye, sends a pattern of neural activity down your optic nerve, passes through some subcortical areas and the thalamus, and stuff like that, which we won't talk much about. 

There is some stuff that happens here, and then it projects down to the occipital lobe, which is otherwise known as the visual cortex, which is in the back of your brain. It's not super important to know where it is, but it's just one of those things—vision happens here in the back for whatever reason. 

This is the place where the first pass of information about your visual environment starts to get computed, mostly in the form of edges, dark patches, light patches, and stuff like that. Once you get from V1, which is the primary visual cortex, it goes through other stages of processing that lead to more and more complex structures emerging. 

You start with things like edges, and if you have enough edges, you can get patches. If you get patches, then you can get textures, and if you get textures, you can get objects. Each stage of visual processing builds on the stage before to eventually lead to the ability to do things like object recognition—like, "Oh, that thing out there is a cat." 

There's a conversation we can have about the parts of that process that go down this lobe, which is your temporal lobe, which tends to be the object space—like, "That's a desk, that's a computer." The part that we tend to care more about in this class is the part that goes up this direction, which tends to be more in tune with using that information to plan your movement out in the world. 

Something I haven't mentioned yet, but is worth repeating, is that this is a cartoon. This is a very abstracted, simplified version of a story. If you wanted to tell the whole story, you would have to tell a thousand stories of a thousand humans in their labs recording data, getting a bunch of numbers, and then making up their own stories in the discussion sections of their own papers about what the different parts mean. 

This cartoonified story is the version that tends to make it into the textbooks that we communicate back to you and try to make sense of. It's really important to remember that this is not the real story; this is the cartoon. The real story is something we don't actually have access to. 

There's no level of class where I can just give you the book that says, "Here is what the visual cortex is actually doing." The best I could ever do is give you a record of all the empirical measurements that all the humans who have ever investigated this have put together and then tell you the story that we have collectively decided is the best story we can come up with for how we think this part of this lumpy pink thing inside all of our skulls is operating. 

But there is a gap—an essential gap—between epistemology, which is our knowledge of things, and metaphysics, which is what actually exists. The two things never truly touch; there is always going to be a difference between knowing something and what that thing actually is. 

In the history of science, we have told many stories about what we think is going on in the world, in our bodies, and in our goopy bits. Historically, over time, every single one of those stories, on a long enough time scale, has proven wrong in some sense. Everything we currently think will eventually be proven wrong in some way or another. Evidence for that is everything we've ever thought up until this point has been proven wrong in some way or another. 

So as you think there's something special about today that’s going to keep happening indefinitely until the sun burns out, the beauty of the scientific process is that we have this belief that even though everything has been wrong, there is a sense that each successive idea is less wrong than the one before it. 

Less wrong means that it allows us to make more precise predictions, heal sickness better, and build machines that do more exciting things. Sometimes those improvements happen by completely throwing out philosophical base-level beliefs about how certain things work. 

But yes, it's a continuous process. We'll talk about it. So here we are in this cycle: the light has bounced off the cat, it's hit your eye, it's been absorbed, it's been transmitted back to your visual cortex. You have identified that it's a cat, and you have an inbuilt volition that says, "I like to touch cats." 

Great, we support this for you. This is the parietal lobe. Don't worry about the parietal lobe; it's great, but you can worry about it if you want. The important part—this back here is your visual cortex. This on the side here, roughly speaking, is your motor cortex. 

Eventually, as you look at more and more pictures of the brain, you will see that the wrinkles and stuff on the brain are not random; they are conserved in the same sense that while every face looks very different, they generally have two eyes, a nose, and a mouth in different configurations. 

The wrinkly stuff and the crevices and bumps on our brains are roughly the same. If you were to crack open all the brains in this room—which I don't recommend—you would find a lot of correspondence in where the big creases and stuff come in. 

I'm not at the level of that anatomy where I can name them off the top of my head, but I do recognize them in pictures. It's easy to tell when someone is drawing a brain artistically versus when they're looking at anatomy because artists often just say, "Oh yeah, it's a bunch of pink wrinkles," and then you just sort of—it's like, okay, that's not actually how we do it. 

But anyways, there's a big one right in the middle called the central sulcus. A sulcus is like the crease part, and on this side of that sulcus is the somatosensory cortex. Somatosensation is basically touch—think of that type of sensation. On that side is the motor cortex. 

So the sensory cortex and then the motor cortex tend to be paired. You can look up the homunculus when we talk about the motor cortex. I enjoy this distinction. There are these two sides of the brain: on this side, it's kind of like sensation and the perception of the world—like visual aspects and sensory aspects—and on this side of the brain is where we start getting to motor actions and movements and the outgoing parts of things. 

As we keep going forward, you eventually get over here to the frontal lobes. The frontal lobe is the big lumpy part in the front; that's the most human part of the brain. All mammal brains are roughly the same anatomically; they're just very fun mirrored into different shapes and sizes. 

Rats have a much more pronounced olfactory bulb for smell versus their visual cortex, and the human brain has a lot of extra anatomy in that frontal lobe area. This is thought to be where decision-making comes from; this is where language kind of lives. It's often referenced in executive function, the feeling of deciding what you want to do. 

This is also where metacognition happens. If you're having thoughts about your thoughts—like, "Oh yeah, I'm angry right now"—that's a frontal lobe area. Just reiterating the point: every time I point to a part of the brain and say, "This is the part that does this thing," a little part of me inside is screaming and dying because none of this is how any of it works. 

That's the cartoon; that's not how the real world is set up. It's much more complex and much noisier than that. If I say, "This is where executive function happens," and I point at the front of the brain, and then say, "This is where vision happens," and I point at the back of the brain, that statement is more true than if I switch those two things around. 

It's important to reiterate that even though I am telling you these simplified stories—these textbook-level conversations about how the brain works—this is the stuff that if we come back to this class in 250 years, we're going to be saying very different things. But we'll probably still say something like, "Vision happens in the back, and cognition happens in the front." 

From this frontal lobe, you get the frontal area, executive functions, and then you get your premotor area. Somewhere around here is where volitions arise. Volition is sort of the same root as voluntary; it's like the things that you want to do. 

You see the cat and say, "I want to touch the cat." Here is the cat, and look at me; I'm touching it. That's what I want to happen. Now you are in a state where here's your body, here's your hand, and here's this cat. There's this desire that I wish my hand was on this cat. 

Now there's a gap between the way the world is in your perception and the way you wish the world would be, which is that your hand was touching this object. Those volitions meld with the perceptual experience, and from this sort of alchemy emerges something resembling a motor plan. 

I'm trying to stop myself from going into details because we will have a whole lecture about the eye, a whole lecture about the motor cortex, and we'll talk about this in more detail. I'm just giving the overview. 

But this is where we would call something the first time we start seeing something resembling a motor plan. There are a lot of times in the chats you all have been having where you talk about things like muscle memory. Muscle memory is a term we like to use; it's a very standard human expression. 

But it’s also one of those things that doesn't really exist in a physiological sense. Your muscles don't have memory; they're much simpler objects, which we will talk about. Usually, what you mean when you say muscle memory is motor plan. 

As you work on something more and more and gain more expertise and experience, what we tend to refer to as muscle memory is really the motor plans becoming more robust and more locked in. Typically, a lot of that motor planning takes place not necessarily in the motor cortex, but most of it starts happening in subcortical regions. 

If you think about a picture of the brain, the pink wrinkly thing in your skull tends to be what we think about. That's your cortex; that's the neocortex. It's the part where most of the processing happens, which we'll talk a little about what processing means in this context. 

I like to talk about this as being like the bloom of the rose on the rose bush. When you think about the nervous system and look at a rose bush, it makes a lot of sense that we tend to focus on the rose—the red thing with petals that smells nice. We spend a lot of our time focusing on that part of the plant for very good reason. 

But if you really take a step back and look at it from a botany point of view, it's mostly bush and just a little bit of rose. I think that's kind of the same with the way our cortex works. The majority of our central nervous system is not in that cortex; it's in the subcortical regions. 

Among my favorite of those subcortical regions is the cerebellum, which looks sort of like this fist-shaped thing that sits right below your cortex. When you look up pictures of the brain online, you'll see the big pink wrinkly thing and this more dense, grayish-looking thing underneath it. 

That's your cerebellum. Your cerebellum is a very complicated beast. It contains about 3.5 times as many neurons as the rest of your central nervous system combined. That number is strangely conserved across different animals. 

All mammals have a cortex and a cerebellum. We have very different brain-to-body ratios and different proportions, but in general, however big your brain is, whatever animal you are, your cerebellum has three and a half times as many neurons as the rest of your cortex. 

Anytime you find a number in nature that's conserved across a bunch of different states, it seems interesting. I wish I knew more about it. Your cerebellum has so many more neurons by count because the neurons associated with it are tiny. 

You have granule cells and Purkinje cells. I'm going to look up pictures of these because Purkinje cells in your cerebellum are one of the more beautiful parts of your brain. You have the cell body, the axon, and then these are all the synapses. There are thousands upon thousands of them. 

This picture is famous; it was actually taken by—oh, sorry, Cajal. Ramon Cajal was part of the group that came up with the staining mechanisms that allowed us to start looking at neurons in isolation. This happened in roughly 1909. Before that, we didn't really know what neurons were and didn't know if they were just one big mass or individualized pieces. 

There was a big scientific and philosophical debate about whether the brain is all one big connected piece or if the neurons touch or are separated from each other. Ramon Cajal argued in favor of the synapse doctrine, which said there was a gap between them. I think it was Golgi who argued in favor of their being all touching. 

Golgi came up with a silver nitrate staining process that allowed them to make images like this, and ironically, by making that staining process, he proved Cajal's side of the argument correct—that they tend not to touch. Both Ramon Cajal and Golgi shared a Nobel Prize, but apparently, they had such bad blood between them that they both spent their entire speeches bashing each other. 

So there you go. Your cerebellum consists of Purkinje cells and granule cells, which in comparison look more like this. They're small and don't have these super long fibers that go very long distances; they're much more localized. They only connect to their immediate neighbors. 

The majority of neurons in your nervous system are these granule cells that live in your cerebellum. Your cerebellum is a layered thing. Like most parts of your brain, it has layers that tend to operate phylogenetically, so the outside is the newest stuff, and the inside is the older stuff. 

The cerebellum has that structure. We may talk about it; I'm not sure. We'll see. It's one of those things that if enough people talk to the bot and ask about this, I might steer the lectures based on the interest of the class. 

But anyway, we're talking about cats. Light hits the cat, hits your eye, is absorbed in your retina, tweaks your opsins, triggers a neural cascade, vibrates your visual cortex, gives you the perception of a cat. Your volitional desire to touch the cat combines with the knowledge that there's a cat in front of you and starts creating a motor plan. 

This is where the cartoon gets really cartoony because there's a lot of controversy about the different steps of this process. But long story short, something in the combination of your motor cortex and your cerebellum—which is largely a motor-based thing—deals with the movement of your body. 

It's thought to be related to tool use. This is something that we humans can do where we pick up an object and quickly learn the physics of it, using it as a tool. That has certain characteristics thought to be a neocortex thing. The neocortex is the new part; it's on the outside; it's complicated. 

There's a hierarchical nature to your motor system where at the higher levels, the plans are much more abstract. It's things like, "I'm thirsty; I wish I was drinking water right now." In order for that high-level volition to be turned into something that can lead me to my goal, there has to be a pairing down of specificity from that very high-level volition down to something that will eventually boil down to muscle firings to move my body through space. 

So as I say, "Oh, I wish I had water," I see that there's water over there, and somehow that volition is converted into motor commands that move my legs. Now my body is in a place where I can move my arm, I know how this thing works, so I open the thing and get to drink water. 

That process tends to go from the motor cortex, then you have the cerebellum, and then your cerebellum has connections to your brainstem. I say connections, but they're really kind of wrapped around each other. You have your brainstem, your medulla oblongata, your pons. 

That's the part of your brain people talk about when they mention your reptilian brain. That's the part that handles things like, "Is my heart beating? Am I breathing? Is my temperature within a livable range?" That tends to be controlled at your brainstem. 

Your brainstem is the start of your spinal cord, which is another good friend. Your spinal cord is a part of your central nervous system. Oftentimes, when we think about the spinal cord, it's given a bad rap. Even when we look at pictures of the central nervous system, we often see pictures that stop here. 

It's just sort of cortico-centrism, focused on that rose on the bush, and less to say about the cerebellum. We often cut off where the spine is, but your spine is just as much a part of your nervous system as the rest of it. 

The way we define the central nervous system as opposed to the peripheral nervous system is loosely that the central nervous system is where processing happens. Processing is a very goopy term that basically means information is coming in, some sort of conversion is happening—which we might call a computation if we wanted to use a computer analogy—and then information goes out. 

The spine is doing that kind of processing at various levels, which we will also talk about. I find it fascinating in very interesting ways, and there are some stories we will talk about later in the semester of studies that we aren't allowed to do anymore on cats, where you can sever the spine—cut the spine so it no longer connects to the upper part of the brain—and the cat can still do things like walk. 

The spine houses the gray matter that handles things like central pattern generation and reflex responses. A central pattern generator is a thing that handles the basic rhythmic motion of my legs and says, "One foot is going to be in stance, and the other one's going to be in swing, and then they're going to swap off." A lot of that processing is handled in the spine itself. 

Your spinal cord ends around here, right below your thoracic spine. The stuff below that is what's called the cauda equina, which is where it becomes more extension-cord-like. You start to lose the gray matter and get more of just the peripheral nerves that go out to your limbs. 

I also want to make the point that the distinction between the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system is often stated as a hard delineation, but there's a lot of gray area there. One of the most classic gray areas is the retina. 

The retina has a lot of neurons on the back of it, and there are layers to it. It's often described as the eye being the classical sensory organ, but there's stuff happening on the back of the retina before anything even leaves on that optic nerve to pass to the brain that could be considered computation. 

Similarly, your skin has a lot of connections in it that might be doing things we might consider computation. When you get hurt, if you rub the area, it doesn't hurt as much because the activity of activating sensory organs around the damaged area suppresses the feeling coming from the damaged area, and that is all happening at the level of your skin. 

These names and terms are not like nature is divided into pieces with departments and names; that's a thing we humans did to nature so that we could have any hope of making sense of it. Anytime we put a name or a label or a category into nature, we're always going to be making concessions and drawing lines around areas because it allows us to have better conversations about those things. 

But there's always going to be gray areas, and often those gray areas or the cracks tend to lead us to abandon certain thoughts and go towards others. Speaking of the peripheral nervous system, this is your arm. These are your bones, and your bones are mostly what you are. 

If we're thinking about it in terms of the space you inhabit, the shape that you are, your general ability to move through the world, it's mostly bones. All the goop associated with that is sort of the details, but the general cookie-cutter shape of you as a creature is driven by these weird sticks, and these weird sticks have weird things attached to them called muscles. 

Eventually, one of the things that happens when you think about the more holistic picture of the world and the way you live in it is that if you're in a lab, living this reductionist life where you're choosing a particular domain of inquiry, you can remove all the parts of the question that you don't want to look at. 

If you're a neuroscientist, you might take the mouse, rat, or fruit fly into the lab and remove all the parts that aren't neuroscience so you can have a better picture of the neurons you care about. When you don't have that capacity and want to think about things more generally, you don't have that luxury. 

If you want to think about how humans move through the world, even if you care mostly about the neural aspects of it, you are required by the nature of reality to consider things like bones and muscles, even though those are not particularly neural objects. 

When we move, all this weird neural activity is eventually going to have to transmit down into something that moves the body through the world. This is where we get to the robotics conversation because this is the part where the neural activity, which has been originally transduced into this sensory experience of vision, is eventually going to be boiled down to something that flips that coin around. 

Now the neural activity is going to be converted into environmental energy, in this case, in the form of mechanical energy. It's going to squeeze my muscle, and my arm is going to move. This has literal energy in this movement, specifically in the form of kinetic energy or, if I'm pulling on a spring or something like that, it might be potential energy. 

That's the whole perception-action cycle: this conversion of environmental energy into perceptual neural activity, down back into a motor action. Your muscles are weird objects. A muscle is effectively a variable stiffness spring; that's pretty much what a muscle is. 

Muscles only pull; they cannot push. When it looks like I'm pushing, it's because this muscle is pulling on the tip of that bone so that my arm goes that way. That's called extension. If I want to squeeze this one, I send a motor command down there; it fires the motor units and says, "Hey, surrounding muscle tissue, contract." 

What was originally a fairly wiggly soft spring gets electrified and becomes a rather stiff spring, pulling this joint up. There are paired muscle groups: there's a flexor muscle group and an extensor muscle group, and those two things operate in conjunction to move this degree of freedom. 

The motor plan that comes down from the motor cortex and through the cerebellum—if you're a fancy type of animal like a human—goes through the corticospinal tract. There is a connection straight from your motor cortex down to your spine, bypassing things like your cerebellum. 

All animals have a corticospinal tract, but not to equal degree. That's one of the interesting distinctions in the animal kingdom. This is one of my favorite questions; I actually use this question to test AI models to see how they do at neuroscience. I ask about the corticospinal tract and how it varies across the animal kingdom because that's one of the places where the questions get really subtle. 

I can look at how it does at that answer to see if I'm looking at a local model I can run on my computer. I can watch it get the subtle parts wrong when I ask it that kind of question. A lot of what I've been talking about—how motor cortex motor commands go through the cerebellum and the brainstem—is true, but there is also this corticospinal tract. 

Anytime you see one of those big words with an "o" in the middle, just replace the "o" with a slash. So corticospinal is C cortex SL spinal. That just basically goes straight from the cortex down to the spine, bypassing all the subcortical regions. 

It's what allows us to control our individual degrees of freedom of our body directly, as opposed to doing things in a more synergistic way, which is way deeper than I want to talk about in this particular lecture. 

Cheating that clock—it's killing me. So here I am; I'm so close. I'm so ready to almost touch this cat. My motor plan, which has come down from on high through the hierarchical structure of our motor system, has taken my awareness of the world and my own body. 

The vision gives me information about remote parts of the world—things I cannot touch. Here's a great word: peripersonal space. The peripersonal space is the area that I can touch with my hands. Outside of that is a different part of the world. 

That's happening in the parietal lobe. One of my favorite studies is where they got a monkey, trained it to grab things on a desk, and then gave it a temporary lesion. They squirted something into the part of the brain that handles that peripersonal perception, so that part of the brain kind of goes offline. 

You get what's called cortical blindness, so the monkey loses its ability to see things in that peripersonal zone. Then they took the monkeys and trained them to use a grabber arm—a little claw arm—so its reach is now farther because it can use this arm. 

When they asked the monkey to use it after teaching it, they found that the blind spot increased to include the region that could be reached with the grabber in addition to the hand. So put that into your worldview and see how it fits. 

Here I am; I see this cat, and I have this awareness of my body. A lot of this is associated with proprioception. As my arm is out here, it is putting force on my joints because of the weight of the arm, and my body can encode and is aware of those forces. 

I can use that to be aware of where my arm is. I can also see my arm; I have a memory of lifting it up. There are a lot of ways that we know where our bodies are, but I know that it's here. If I can make this part move that way, then I will have achieved my deepest desire of touching this cat. 

There's a lot of complicated stuff about how we don't move our body one joint at a time; we move it in a sort of barely sophisticated dance. A lot of that breakdown of how we choose to break down a complex movement across the available joints in the context of the world—that's a cerebellum thing again. 

But let's pretend like it's not. I relax the flexor, tighten the extensor, and that puts a torque on this bone, which moves my hand here. Now I have the reward of cat sensations under my hand, and I have achieved this goal of mine. 

That's the loop. That's one path through that perception-action loop. Now that the information has gone in, been processed, and I have moved my body, I have changed the state of the world. My body is now in the world, so as I'm perceiving the situation as it stands, I'm perceiving something different. 

Now I'm going to go back through that loop. You perceive, you act, and then you take in the information. That loop is where you live your whole life. 

This is kind of the cartoon overview of the story as it holds. I will name some of the fields associated with the things we talked about. Generally speaking, when we talk about the physiology of the eyeball, it tends to be called optology, I guess. 

That's more like lens and pupil and the goopy parts. Once you're talking about the neural activity aspect of it, we tend to call that visual neuroscience or perceptual neuroscience because we are such vision-heavy animals as humans. Often when you hear "perceptual," we tend to mean visual, but strictly speaking, it's all sensory. 

When we start talking about the parts of neuroscience that are moving your body, we tend to call that motor neuroscience. You will often hear people talk about perceptual-motor neuroscience, which again is the same as perceptual and motor. It's this connection and the reality that perception and action, and perception and motor control, are intimately linked. 

In your peripheral nervous system, you have peripheral neurons, and your peripheral neurons come in two types: perceptual and motor. Shockingly, that distinction is defined by which direction the information is flowing. A motor command goes out from your central nervous system towards your periphery, carrying a motor command. 

This is a neuron that's connected to a motor unit in my muscle, and if it gets tapped by one of these higher-level structures, it's going to get spikes that tell it to fire, which will contract the muscle. Once I touch the cat, what was the object of my plans, the neurons connected to the sensory organs in my hand start firing differently and send information back down your sensory peripheral nerves. 

In your periphery, outward stuff is your motor neurons, and inward stuff is your sensory neurons. That's kind of the main distinction there. 

Just the word "cartoons" going on there. Why are you not aware? This is one of the most troubling realities of being alive, and this is also part of the standard existential crisis that classes like this tend to give to people, so have fun with that. 

We have a very thin awareness of what is going on under the hood in our bodies. We have some awareness; we have some conscious experience of, "I'm going to reach out and grab this thing," or, "Oh yeah, this feels cool in my hand; this feels hard in my hand." 

But the more you learn about neuroscience and what’s going on under the hood, the more you realize that the cognitive, conscious personal experience of having a motor experience is a really thin layer on top of a lot of complexity that's going on. That is unfortunately just the situation we are in. 

I remember one time I was in grad school, and we were in a parking lot, my friends and I, waiting to go on a hike or something. For some reason, this really stuck with me, but there was a puddle of dirty water in the middle of the parking lot that had this really beautiful oil sheen on top of it. 

It had these fractal iridescent colors, and by the nature of oil, it's just one molecule thick, giving this beautiful, vibrant, colorful shape on top of cold, dark, murky water. I think about that a lot when I think about the nervous system because it feels like our experience of living in a body is riding on top of this deep and complex biological neural system. 

That conscious sheen is related to the depths of what's going on there, but we don't really tend to have access to it. I can't feel my stomach deciding when it wants to squirt out more enzymes to digest my food, and I can't tell the difference between parts of this thing happening. 

It's just not really available to me. Once you start learning about the bits and pieces, you can start mapping your conscious experiences to the things that I'm going to be telling you are maybe happening under the hood. 

One of the ones that’s coming to me right now is that when a person starts lifting weights for the first time, if you've never been a weightlifting person, there's a thing that happens where you quickly shoot up the amount of weight you can lift in a very short amount of time because your body is learning how to fire all of your motor units at once. 

That's just something you tend not to do in your general life, and you have to learn how to do that—how to extend maximal effort. That's something happening at the level of recruitment of motor units. 

If you now go to the gym and start having that experience, you feel, "Oh yeah, I'm getting super strong." You can map that experience onto this thing I just said about how your motor units work, but that mapping is in this weird cognitive space. 

It's not at that level of deep awareness. You have to ask, "What would that even look like?" Over time, when you're lifting weights, why do you hit a plateau? Eventually, you're recruiting all of your motor units, and you just don't have enough muscle to produce the force. 

That beginner spike in performance is because you're not actually growing muscle mass in that period of time; you're just learning how to use all the muscles you have. Then you hit that plateau, and it's like, "Okay, now I'm firing 100% of my muscle abilities, but my muscles aren't strong enough to actually move my body." 

A lot of those plateaus in performance can be tied back to physiological structures that change. The time courses of improvement happen—growing more muscle takes time, whereas learning how to fire motor units also takes time, but not in the same way. 

There's a lot of depth there. That area I was just talking about is often in the area we would call neuromechanics. Neuromechanics is a relatively newly named field. I would be curious to see if it's in that mesh terminology thing we learned about last time. 

But neuromechanics is at that boundary of neural activity and physics—mechanics. Firing a motor unit to create a spring force that moves the limb is a neuromechanical question. How that connects to spinal central pattern generators—that's where it starts to get like, "Is that still neuromechanics?" 

These are murky areas. On the other side of neuromechanics, you have biomechanics. Biomechanics is literally Newton's laws as they apply to meat. We will be talking about that to some level of specificity in the not-too-distant future. 

Biomechanics is related to the physics of moving your body. We're particularly going to talk about descriptions of the body that remove any conception of biology from them, thinking about the human as an object that weighs a lot and is balanced on a pretty narrow platform. 

That's the center of mass and base of support level of description of the human body, which we will talk about in some detail pretty soon. Another thing I haven't mentioned but we will talk about is evolution because all of these systems are evolved systems. They developed over billions of years to the form they currently are. 

You can describe the system as it stands right now, but you're always going to be missing some of the story if you don't think about it in the context of how it emerged. I haven't quite figured out a lot of the things I'm talking about that will go into these numbered lectures once I figure out how I want to chop things up. 

I'm going to extract a lot of things from your conversations to figure out how to steer those lectures. There are some hit points I'm going to hit no matter what you guys want to do, and evolution is going to be one of those things. 

Specifically for us, I'm going to talk a little about the evolution of your eye, but I think a lot of my particular interest is in the evolution of your skeleton—why our skeletons are the particular weird shape that they are, how we developed from our origins as fish that turned into lizards that turned into squirrels that turned into monkeys that turned into apes that turned into us. 

It matters a lot. The evolution of our eye is another odd story. Our retina is backwards in some interesting ways; it's flipped in the direction you would expect it to be. You would expect that the light-sensing aspects would be facing towards the light, but they're actually backwards. They face back and have to bounce through, and this is thought to be related to when we crawled out of the ocean and our eyes inverted to allow the same kind of refraction to happen. 

We didn't talk in this particular story about eye movements. Eye movements we will talk about in some detail. We humans have very mobile eyes; that's a cornerstone aspect of our visual system. Our eyes move a lot. 

It's part of the motor system to be able to move any part of your body, including the eyes. That specific area is called oculomotor control. Oculo means eye, and motor means movement. Oculomotor is related to eye movements. 

Things like oculomotor control are obviously very overlapping with things like visual perception and perceptual neuroscience because as we move our eyes, the information on the retina changes. We make decisions about where to move our eyes in the same way we make decisions about where to move our arms. 

You can live a whole happy life and never really think about your eye movements, but once you start thinking about them, you'll realize that you think about it a lot. It feels a lot like breathing to me, where usually your breathing is something that just happens on its own, but you can control it to some extent. 

I can hold my breath; I can take a breath. I have volitional control over my breathing in a way that I don't over my heart. Our eye movements are kind of like that as well. I can choose to look one place or another; I can choose not to look at something. 

But for the most part, for 99.9% of my waking life, my eyes are just kind of doing what they do, driven by a combination of available visual information and my desires of the world. Sometimes, if I throw something in the air, I will look at it and then catch it. 

A lot of that process is happening just below the level of conscious awareness. I think that's a nice enough segue into what we're going to talk about for the last 10 minutes, which is methods—methodologies. 

Methods is just the term we use for how in God's name are you going to study any of this. That's kind of what methods means. Generally speaking, when we talk about methods, we're talking about equipment and ways we can do empirical measurements of the world that will give us information about parts of the world we think we might glean some insight into. 

This is another great term: desiderata of our investigation. Desiderata means that which is desired. It's a philosophy of science term about what you're trying to figure out. You came into this room as a scientist because there's something you want to know more about—some part of the world you want to gain insight into. 

What is that thing, and how can you do it given all the limitations, constraints, and difficulties of how the world is? For me, in my domain of inquiry, I use two primary research tools: motion capture, which is the thing you see behind-the-scenes stuff in movies and video games—the suit with the dots and stuff like that. 

That's motion capture, and it's related to recording the movement of the body in space. I will be at one of the lab sections showing you. I'll be bringing in some cameras and doing a freeo cap recording, which is the open-source software I've been building designed to help record the body with a high degree of fidelity. 

This specific three-dimensional configuration of the body at any given moment in time is important because I would love to study all the activity of the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, but that's not available to me in this year of our Lord 2025. I can't actually get that measurement. 

The methods I could use—even if we could get that from something like fMRI, which is the tube that gives you colorful pictures of the brain—in this current moment in technology, I can't use that type of tool and also have a person out in the world throwing and catching and doing stuff like that. 

So we use motion capture as a methodology to record the 3D configuration of the body over time. Then we use those movements to try to infer, "Well, if the arm did this and gravity is like that, then the muscles must have done this or that in order to produce the forces that generated that movement." 

You backtrack from, "If the muscles did this, then the spine must have done that." You can use this observable aspect of reality, which is the location of the arm, measure it to the level of fidelity you can with the available technology, and then use those empirical measurements to try to infer all this weird goopy nonsense about this part of the brain, that part of the brain, and that part of the brain. 

The other technology I tend to use a lot is eye tracking, which everybody loves. Eye tracking is always a crowd favorite. That's another sort of—there are different tools to use it, but mostly these days we use video-based eye trackers, which are literally just little cameras pointed at the eye. 

It's a convenient thing that we humans have these highly mobile eyes that give this interesting readout of what my brain wanted to get more information about at each moment in time. If you give me a task like walking over rough terrain or juggling or throwing and catching, you can look at the movement of my eye and know the visual information that was available to me in that moment by doing 3D modeling. 

You can say, "Okay, the eye moved this way, and the object was over here." Based on what I know about the eye, I couldn't see it then, or I could see it in my periphery. Then I chose to make a movement that would align my eye so now it's in my fovea. 

You can use just a camera pointed at the eye to tell the information that was being transmitted into my visual cortex. More importantly, arguably, the place that my eyes move to tells me where my central nervous system decided it wanted more information from in the world at any moment in time. 

The combination of these things—being able to measure the perceptual input in the form of eye tracking and the motor output in the form of motion capture—this is my general attempt. My general approach to scientific research is to combine these two methodologies to get a picture of what a human is doing in the world as they perform complex actions. 

Then I use that weird pile of data that pours out of those machines to give some insight into this stuff, often in my particular case in the conversation of science. This type of research tends to give ecologically valid, realistic data of real people doing real stuff, but the fidelity is just limited. 

The accuracy and precision of information I can provide with these methods is very limited relative to someone who's in a lab pulling out individual neurons and doing all the reductionist work they can do to get really precise numbers. The sociology of science is that people like me doing the broad scope type of research work with people who do the more careful reduction of stuff. 

Ideally, we both work together so we can tell more complete stories and tell more satisfying cartoon stories of what's going on for humans to new generations of undergrads every year or two. 

Okay, did I cover all that? No more questions? Neuroscience nailed it. Great, cool. Well, actually, that's it. Do we have like three more minutes? Does anyone have any questions or emotional outbursts, existential crises, or things you wish I had said more about? 

No one would say anything in this moment in class. I appreciate it. Oh, you do like the opsin thing? Yeah, opsin—that's the term. Opsin reminded me of—yeah, it's the same. I mean, plants don't really have the motor aspect, but that's for the biochemistry people. 

I think opsin is the part that has more depth there. There's a lot of depth there. Great, thank you for showing up. Keep an eye on the Discord server and Canvas. I'll make an announcement about the actual assignments going on. 

See you on—oh, not an assignment this Sunday? No, not this Sunday. I guess Monday is a holiday, so I'll see you in a week. Someone here told me that. Was it you? Somebody told me there was a holiday. Thank you; I appreciate that. I probably would have figured it out. I didn't have either one of them. 

Yeah, I think it was just those two. Yeah, exactly. Okay.
